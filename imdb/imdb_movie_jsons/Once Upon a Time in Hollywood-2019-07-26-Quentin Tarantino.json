But still a pretty damn good and smart movie with cool sequences, great acting and directing, music and scenes that will stay with you long after the movie and you would love to watch again.\nLoved the combo Pitt-DiCaprio but loved more seeing some famous characters in this film such as Steve Mcqueen and Bruce Lee, who are absolutely hilarious in the movie!\n8/10", "Best Movie I Have Seen In At Least 10 Years, Should Be Seen Twice, BIG SPOILERS": "I have seen this film twice in the last two days, I probably will see it many more times.Tarantino has shocked and surprised me before, but this was the biggest shock of all. The movie is set in the Hollywood of 1969, just before the brutal Manson family murders.Leonard Dicaprio and Brad Pitt give career high performances. Dicaprio is Rick Dalton, a TV cowboy actor who longs for movie stardom but has now hit the skids. Pitt plays Cliff Booth his stunt double/driver and all around best bud. They also represent doubles of each other in real life, though Dalton is angry and frustrated at his failings in life while Booth is perfectly happy to be his pal's gopher and handyman. There is good recreations of TV westerns of the time, Dalton had been the star of \"Bounty Law\" a show that never existed but is clearly based on Steve McQueen's \"Wanted Dead Or Alive\" series. Dalton is now playing guest role villains on TV. An actual series \"Lancer\" is recreated here, I never saw this show when it aired since it was on up against \"The Mod Squad\" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dalton has some funny and touching scenes opposite a precocious 8 year old actress while doing the \"Lancer\" episode. The late Luke Perry has his final film appearance in these scenes also.Margot Robbie has an almost magical presence playing actress Sharon Tate. Tate unfortunately is best known today as the most famous of the Manson family murder victims. We see not only how beautiful she was but also how good and kind she was as well. One of my favorite scenes is when she goes to a movie theater to watch \"The Wrecking Crew\" a film she made in 1968 with Dean Martin. We see actual clips of the movie, (with the real Sharon Tate) and cuts back to her reactions, she becomes delighted when the audience laughs at her comedy bits and applauds at her fight scene with Nancy Kwan.The film starts to turn dark when Cliff picks up a teenage girl hitchhiker who wants to be taken to Spahn Ranch, a run down movie set where he once worked. I have read nearly everything about the Manson case, so I knew where it was going now. Cliff sees a bunch of mostly hippie girls hanging around and asks if George Spahn the original owner of the ranch still lives there. The scenes at the ranch are quietly disturbing. Dakota Fanning (I did not recognize her) plays Squeaky, one of the real life Manson girls. Her vacant eyes and cold manner make for some suspenseful moments. Cliff is concerned about his old friend George and demands to see him. He finds him now old and blind (Bruce Dern in a great cameo) but at least alive. Cliff is still suspicious but leaves the ranch.The final act comes up for the biggest shock of all. Rick has returned from several months filming some spaghetti westerns in Italy.He has also gotten married to an Italian actress. It is now August 8 1969. Cliff and his faithful pit bull Brandy are staying the night at Rick's house. Sharon Tate and some of her friends arrive at her home (which is right next door to Rick) to spend the evening together. Then Manson followers Charles \"Tex\" Watson, Patricia \"Katie\" Krenwinkel, Susan \"Sadie\" Atkins and Linda Kasabian are driving up the road. I knew what was coming and was dreading this moment, I was hoping that Tarantino would not show the gruesome murders but I was preparing myself.\nThen Rick hears them driving up and has an angry altercation with them, then I was a bit surprised that real life characters were suddenly intermingling with fictional characters on a night when a horrible historic moment happened. When Rick goes into the house, the killers suddenly realize that he was the star of the TV show \"Bounty Law\". Then psycho Sadie goes on a rant about how TV showed her generation how to kill by showing murders every week on the small screen. I had heard some Manson followers had actually said this. Linda is too scared to go with the other three and takes the car keys and drives off leaving them. Another change in the real story, Linda did not participate in the murders but did stay with them, so once again I am getting bewildered. Tex, Sadie and Katie than decide to go to Rick's house rather than Sharon's. I am wondering are they now going to kill them also? Then the most surprising thing happens, Cliff, his pit bull and Rick decide to fight back against these scummy creeps leaving them to be battered and massacred. Brandy has some great scenes as one of the most heroic dogs I have seen in film. My head was reeling by this time, I kept thinking \"Are they really doing this?\" Then came the ending, Rick is now safe, Cliff injured but alive. And now Rick gets to meet his next door neighbor Sharon and her friends. I am still in shock but then for the first time we see the title on screen \"Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood\" and then I finally get it, this is a Hollywood story not real life, this is what we wish would have happened.I finally had to see the film again for a second time so I could actually enjoy that climatic scene, without the dread and confusion I had the first time.\nThis is a phenomenal work, like nothing I have ever seen and probably never will again.", "A love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable.": "It took Quentin Tarantino a lifetime of living, 5 years to write and a 2 hours 41 minutes watch. This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support.The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair.Will be quite a bit for those under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood. Some will categorise this as an over indulgent nostalgia trip for movie geeks. And they are likely to be correct. But for those of us who complain that Hollywood is reduced to remakes and comic book films, QT delivers a unique and creative viewing experience.", "The Emperor with No Clothes": "It reminds me of that old fable. People go to see Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in a film by Tarantino and assume it has to be great despite what they are actually seeing on the screen.. The film is incredibly slow paced and neither funny nor suspenseful. Throwing in a 5 minute fantasy violent scene at the end after over two hours of boredom did NOT make me change my mind..\nSadly disappointing to this fan of most Tarantino films.", "QT9 - a Hollywood fairy tale": "Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled \"Bounty Law\". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent \"Fosse/Verdon\" or \"The Leftovers\", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (\"Lancer\"). 90 year old Clu Gulager (\"The Virginian\", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (\"Lancer\"). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to \"catch\" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone.", "Do we need a tenth?": "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood has been receiving some great reviews (it's currently rated 8.3 here on IMDb), but I think it's one of Tarantino's weakest movies. For well over two hours, virtually nothing of interest happens: as much as I didn't particularly enjoy Kill Bill Pt 2, Death Proof or Jackie Brown, I can't say I was bored, but OUATIH is just that -- boring! There's none of Tarantino's sparkling dialogue, no iconic scenes, and the ending simply pulls off the same trick that the director employed in Inglourious Basterds -- changing history (only in this instance, it all seems to be in questionable taste given what really happened fifty years ago).As a fan of cult movies, Italian westerns, Bruce Lee and old TV shows, and as someone with an interest in the Manson murders, I fully expected to be enthralled by Tarantino's re-creation of 60s Hollywood, its colourful characters, and one of the darkest moments in its history, but was totally taken aback by how mundane this movie is. If you want to watch Brad Pitt feed his dog, mend a TV aerial and drive a car, then this is the movie for you; if you want to see Leonardo DiCaprio talk about books to an 8 year old and record an episode of a dull TV western (a scene that went on way too long) then have at it. I think that if this is the standard of movie that Tarantino is dishing up, he should call it quits at nine.4/10 for the face-smashing, dog-biting, flame-throwing final\u00c3\u00a9, which actually perked me up. But that's being generous.", "Flagrant Tarantino Fame Abuse": "If a no name writer came with such non-sense, their script would've hit the bin within the first ten pages. The script mocks every theory on character and plot development. Yet, the same gurus who would trash a rookie script writer for bringing anything less then perfect, are bowing now in humble awe to the great QT. This in not about double standards, but about Hollywood having no standards at all.", "California Dreaming.": "There may never be another filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino. If there is, we surely are in luck. But in all likelihood, future generations will just be students of his, and thank God for that fact alone. He's a filmmaker's filmmaker. His love of cinema verges on fetishism. His mission in life, it seems, was to keep his celluloid memories alive and in the American psyche in a time long past it's expiration date. So long as there's a reel and a way, Tarantino will give you a ticket to the greatest shows on earth, filled with filthy language and splattering gore violence. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is his 9th feature film. It's been announced as his second to last film. Rumor has it, if the film basks in an exponentially warm reception, this could be his last film. I pray we can all sit down one last time for the number 10, but if Quentin is seriously considering it, I'll warmly and happily accept that. The truth is, it's all been leading up to this moment. Quentin's personal crescendo, encapsulating all he has learned and all he has experienced as a man living in Hollywood and a successful filmmaker from within it. He went for it, and he did it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the best film of 2019, and easily his best film since Pulp Fiction. For me, nothing short of perfect. Everything I wanted it to be, and yet it still shocked and surprised me. I'm convinced that after the second and even third viewings, i'll still find new things to love about it. For nearly three hours in length, it grabs you up from your seat and never lets go.Here's the story. The year is 1969. We meet the dashing Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his frisky stuntman sidekick, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The dynamic duo of black and white television, and old, gunslinging cowboy movies. They were the best, they were the most handsome and they were the most talented. They were the best actors in Hollywood.. until now. After an unkindly meeting with his agent, Marvin Schwartz (played in outrageous fashion by the great Al Pacino), Rick is told in no uncertain terms that his time as a leading man is over. In other words, he's lost everything. Reduced to playing walk-on roles in late-60's TV shows, and B-grade Italian spaghetti westerns that nobody will ever see. Devastated, he returns to sulk in his luxury home in the Hollywood hills, while Cliff goes home to a dingy trailer next-door to a drive-in movie theater, to feed his loyal pit-bull Brandy. California Dreaming is not all that it seems. But wouldn't you know it, Rick Dalton has a new neighbor. One Roman Polanksi and his wife, superstar Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). The contrast doesn't get much starker. As Rick Dalton disappears into the hazy California sunset, Tate and friends are dancing in the middle of it. We begin to alternate between these two stories. Rick Dalton's personal misery in landing mediocre roles, and Sharon Tate humbly enjoying her career at it's peak. She's so humble, in fact, she attends screenings of her own movies in town to kick her feet back and laugh with the audience. But in the middle of the high and hard times of show business, evil lurks in the background, ready to attack. That evil being the Manson family. Cliff, Rick and Sharon all have individual run-ins with Charlie and the gang, dismissing them as your average dirty hippies, not realizing they are all about to make a head-on collision with Helter Skelter.From it's very beginning, Tarantino doesn't just show you how things were in 1969, he places you there right along with it. I was there with all of them. Many of the sequences here include interludes of driving with an authentic live radio blasting (not unlike K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's) the soundtrack of our film. Killer psychedelic tunes and radio ads narrate the few times where our characters stay silent, which in any Tarantino film, is brief. The first hour and a half of the film may even puzzle viewers with how little happens between the characters. But that's the point. Tarantino places the audience through multiple POVs in order to illustrate this time in Hollywood. It was a technique I didn't expect, but I adored it all the same, and if anything, I'll always remember these sequences first when I think of the film. DiCaprio lights up the screen as the manically depressed Rick Dalton who goes between arrogantly strutting on set as if he's still a hot shot, to wrecking his trailer in a fit of insecurity and rage. Brad Pitt is effortlessly cool as Cliff Booth. Dude is the suavest partner-in-crime since Paul Newman. Robbie plays Tate, and with the responsibility of playing the prime victim of one of the most gruesome and horrifying murders in American history, she needed to bring honor in this special tribute to her. Not only did she bring honor, but she also brought beauty, grace, wistful optimism and love. If she had a a song, it would probably be \"Good Morning, Starshine\", though we all know she was a Paul Revere and the Raiders fan. Tate represents here all that was good of the late 60's. That far-out, free-spirited, love your neighbor, flower power that most Californians at that time adopted.. so long as you didn't take it to the extreme. If you did, you'd turn into one of those goddamn dirty hippies.That's the other thing that Tarantino explores in 1969. If you were worried about a film about the Manson family that glorifies them as super cool anti-heroes, you best sit down and let this film do the talking. Because Tarantino clearly doesn't just hate Charles Manson, he loathes him. The man who, in his mind, killed the 1960's and the Hollywood he loved. On that note, you might be asking yourself.. this film doesn't really reenact the events of that horrible night, does it? Well, I promise you, this is a spoiler free review, but lets just say the events of August 8th 1969 don't play out here as they did in history. What results is the biggest middle finger ever given to the Manson Family in an epic finale so mindbogglingly brutal and relentless, it will make your jaw drop.I left the theater having felt like I drank a strong cocktail of Boogie Nights and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, ripped a bong and got awakened by a punch in the face. This is a movie, and a trip and an experience you won't soon forget. See this thing, right now. See it twice. See it three times. Invite in into your head and let it stay there and stew. Explore this tapestry of Americana, booze, sex, drugs, rock' n' roll and movies. You'll be exhausted, but you will be satisfied.", "Tarantino just created a new genre of film": "I don't typically leave IMDb reviews but this film deserves so much praise for its risky screenplay in such a dark true crime setting.For 2 hrs, 41 minutes, I was taken 50 years back, experiencing Hollywood's film industry as a comedic drama filled with desire, tension and everyday life.I liked Brad's character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn't.I gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn't long enough for me. I would like to see a director's cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.I had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I'll never forget.", "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood forced me to recall that the golden age of filmmaking was never this tedious.": "Not even Tarantino with his blood-soaked trademark violence can save this year from mediocrity. It's abundantly clear that his ninth film is a passion project, his love letter to 60s Los Angeles when it was deemed cool for the hippie lifestyle to integrate with mainstream America. It's substantially glossy, kaleidoscopic, heck some may even describe this three hour long \"epic\" as, well, epic. The only thing epic about this behemoth is Dalton's beastly flamethrower as he incinerates a group of Nazis. This is, without a doubt in my mind, Tarantino's weakest film to date and another sign of his progressive downfall in quality. An ageing television actor, his swooning stunt double and actress Sharon Tate navigate the alterations of the Hollywood film industry, with the Manson \"Family\" providing a suitably bleak backdrop.Technically, this comedy-drama is good, and I'm not just saying that to ease the scathing hatred that is inevitably flying my way from Tarantino fans. His directorial efforts were effortless. Managing to sustain multiple storylines with a wide array of cameos from his ensemble cast and allowing the lead actors to chew the scenery til it's just mulch. A tribute to the art of filmmaking whilst also providing insight in an actor's mind during vast changes within the industry that made him famous. Tarantino's foot fetish aside, his ability to swoop the camera from high octane tracking shots following a horse to sub-urban houses in Hollywood hills (mostly comprising of single takes) is unprecedented. Even with a simple conversational piece, much like when Dalton meets Fraser for the first time and talks about the novel he's reading and resembling, it's executed with such confidence that it immediately entrances you. Overextended and laborious? Absolutely. Yet witnessing Dalton come to terms with his acting talent, alongside the beautiful creature that is Olyphant playing James Stacy, is oddly engrossing.Of course, only possible due to DiCaprio's electric performance. Purposefully overacting, consistently shouting and harnessing the only developed arc out of all the characters Tarantino shoves into the film. His comedic timing, reminiscent of his venture in Scorsese's 'The Wolf of Wall Street', is impressive and allows a handful of laughs to sneak in, particularly when on the set of 'Lancer'. These characters all residing in a well-designed, precisely replicated and exuberant city that encapsulated the culture at the time. The production was immaculate, accompanied by a signature soundtrack that oozes sophistication and provides a mixtape for golden rock'n'roll.So, like I mentioned, technically this is a very proficient film. Which begs the question \"why was I underwhelmed?\". Well, that's because nothing happens. A near three-hour collage of Cliff Booth driving across Los Angeles, Sharon Tate watching her own film and the Manson \"Family\" walking bare feet on lukewarm sand. It's so self-indulgent with no actual substance that it borders on being pretentious. The multiple storylines rarely mesh. Booth is the exact same character from start to finish and is only present to beat the smack down out of Bruce Lee. Tate has no purpose to the over arcing story whatsoever and diminishes the talent of Robbie who has considerably limited screen time. The entire Manson backdrop is utterly futile in terms of placement, that it seems incredibly forced during the last act (although ridiculously fantastic to watch) just so Tarantino can address the cult's motives. The length that various scenes last for was enough to send anyone to sleep, mostly due to the restrained writing from Tarantino that lacks the punch from his previous efforts. An unaccomplished conclusion that left me questioning the entire purpose of the film. Aside from Dalton being introduced to his neighbours, the start of the story is the exact same as the ending. No one has any development! When Tarantino alludes to something happening, like Booth investigating Spahn Ranch, he deviates and sets the pace back to pedestrian mode. Simply a mish-mash of cameos so that everyone working in Hollywood today can claim they were part of a Tarantino feature.For a film that is designed to be a homage to the golden age of Hollywood, there is a distinct lack of gold to be found in this bejewelled ensemble presentation. Whilst technically proficient and wonderfully acted, the absence of substance and genuine character development makes a three-hour affair feel more like a five hour ordeal. And it pains me to say that, as I wanted Tarantino to be the saving grace of this lacklustre year.", "Slickly made in many ways, but the content is unfocused, messy, and too reliant on the delivery in the moment than the bigger picture": "I approached this film not knowing too much about it, although I was a little aware of the Manson murders, Sharon Tate, and the fact that this film was loosely set around those events, but very much a fictional version of them (or a total fairy tale as is suggested by the title). Watching the film needed me to invest in that approach from the very start, because it is a nostalgic imagining of a better time without much of a connection to reality. This is made reasonably clear throughout by the insertion of the characters into real shows and films of the era, and of course by significant elements of the ending, which changes history somewhat.What is less clear is 'why' the film is doing this. It produces a reasonably enjoyable film with plenty to enjoy in the moment, in the performances, and in the overall delivery, but in terms of narrative flow it feels so fragmented and unfocused that it is hard to stick with it for such a long running time. Almost all of the scenes are engaging in some way, but as a whole they do not come together; even the extreme revision of history seems like it lacks a specific point or message for the casual viewer. It was a distancing effect on me because I enjoyed all these moments but yet was happy in them without caring really for what came next.The performances are strong. Pitt is good (although I was surprised by his Oscar) but I found DiCaprio to be the stronger performance as he had more character to get his teeth into. Robbie is a cheery presence, but only that - she isn't really a character so much as a frame of reference that we have to like; as such she works, but it doesn't sit well in the film because there is a lot of oddity when it comes to the handling of characters. The women are consistently fawned over, with a particularly weird focus on feet almost every chance it gets. Likewise the female characters bring less to the film, and are much more 'devices' than even some male characters with very little screen time.In the end, it is still a solid movie with plenty to like about it, but this is almost in spite of itself. It has unforced problems, seems rambling and messy, and relies a lot on the sheer force of its talent (cast and crew) to make the film work as well as it does - but this isn't well enough for something this long that doesn't have a strong enough narrative through-line.", "1969 Never Looked So Good": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a film that is aesthetically appealing from start to finish. Quentin Tarantino's interpretation of 1969 Hollywood is a lush world with superb detail. This movie serves as a love letter to the place Tarantino presumably grew up with.The cast features an All Star ensemble of actors. Whether supporting or main, every character in this film is portrayed with excellence. Leonardo DiCaprio continues to flex his acting prowess in his portrayal of Rick Dalton. DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is a classic take on the waning career of a once successful actor. His emotion as Rick Dalton is felt in a comical and rewarding sense. His anguish is felt prominently within this film. DiCaprio continues to be brilliant. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Sharon Tate is graceful and wholesome. Robbie's ability to emote with facials alone is true talent. Her on screen presence grants the film and audience with a sense of euphoria. Brad Pitt's character of Cliff Booth is a bad ass in every aspect. His portrayal of the character is presented with an enduring chip on the shoulder. When Cliff Booth is on screen, the film is given security. Pitt continues to exhibit why he is a name that should always be in the discussion of great actors. Pitt's chemistry with DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is excellent. Both men play off each other in a manner that makes you believe they are best friends in real life. On rare occasions will you get a chemistry more authentic than this. Rick and Cliff mirror that of Abbott and Costello, or Batman and Robin. Both men were made for these roles and are symbiotic to one another.The dialogue in this film is up to par with the rest of Tarantino's filmography. Every word feels natural, and every encounter is perfect. Tarantino continues his streak of quotable One liners. Tarantino does an excellent job of flexing his knowledge of 1969 Hollywood within his dialogue and writing. The film is masterfully paced as well. The flashbacks don't step on the present story and they add incredible depth to an ever growing tale. The film is slow paced in that it adds background and detail to the characters and the world they live in. There are minor points of foreshadowing that tie in perfectly to the overall story. The payoff to this story is incredibly satisfying and unexpected. Tarantino is a master in storytelling at this point in his career.The film is shot beautifully. Every shot matters and serves a purpose. Tarantino exhibits his appreciation for 1969 Hollywood through long shots of beautiful scenery and diegetic sound. Tarantino's angling of the camera is natural, serving as a film student's wet dream. Once again, the world is incredibly lush. The soundtrack exhibits some of the best usage of music in recent cinema. At times the film feels like a big music video, however this does not take away from anything within the film. The music serves as the mascot for Tarantino's 1969 Hollywood. The music and the setting of 1969 Hollywood are inseparable.Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is another masterpiece in Quentin Tarantino's filmography. Whereas Pulp Fiction excels in storytelling and dialogue, this film excels in storytelling and cinematography. 1969 never looked so good.", "Mediocre and Overrated Film": "\"Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood\" is one of the most overrated film released by Hollywood industry. The hype is difficult to be understood but certainly has influenced those puppets that like to read the professional reviews to have their own opinion. The screenplay is boring and the good point is the references to films and the soundtrack based on the 60's. As usual in Quentin Tarantino's films, the cast is impressive. But this time, the film is a great disappointment. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): 'Era Uma Vez em... Hollywood\" (\"Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood\")", "Was I even watching the same film?": "All this critical acclaim for this film (mainly because it's a Tarantino one) is so baffling. So what's wrong with it? For a start nothing actually happens throughout until the last 10 minutes. It's a slow, turgid, self congratulatory affair with drawn out scenes and tons of tips of the cap to the 'era' - through the soundtrack and product placement of 1960s packaging, or 'real life' characters like Sam Wannamaker's appearance - that just aren't needed. They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a 'what if?' moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.There were genuine tense moments like when Pitt's character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character's move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would've looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate's character for that matter once you see the ending....?This was a missed opportunity that could've been a great piece on an actor's dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones. Tarantino is become the new Woody Allen...actors want one of his films on their resume despite the fact he hasn't made a good one in so long", "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood": "At the end of the movie, the director made a bold, creative and plausible treatment, which put a warm veil on the bloody and cruel historical facts, just like the path towards the Polansky mansion with full moon light. Let all the simple, beautiful and vivid stay on the screen, which is the most unique and attractive charm of the film.", "Much ado about nothing.": "DiCaprio and Pitt collaborate with Tarantino once again for the directors ninth (and supposedly penultimate) feature film as writer/director. Set in 1969 Hollywood, the film follows fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his loyal stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they navigate their way through the absurdities of Hollywood life. Inbetween their exploits we follow Sharon Tate (Robbie), who gleefully indulges in all the fun and glamour that Tinseltown has to offer. I'm a big Tarantino fan, so naturally my expectations for Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood were high. What a shame it is then to report his ninth feature is an uneven, average affair that doesn't live up to the brilliance of his previous efforts.Both DiCaprio and Pitt make for a great pairing, and they both carry the film even throughout its most sluggish moments. Margot Robbie is sadly wasted in the film as Tarantino gives her practically nothing of worth to work with, resulting in what feels more like an over glorified cameo as opposed to a legitimate role worth playing. Narratively speaking, the film is uneven and at times tedious to sit through. Tarantino is known for his engaging storylines, intriguing characters and sharp dialogue, but none of that is to be found here. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood doesn't really have a cohesive storyline, emphasized largely by the elimination of chapter breakdowns, a storytelling technique Tarantino is widely known for. At its core, it's a celebration of Hollywood moviemaking during the sixties and an exploration into the relationships between actors and their stunt doubles. While there are a handful of noteworthy scenes to be found here, they aren't enough to save the film from being a pretty average affair. Technically speaking the film is very well made and contains great shot composition along with a solid soundtrack. Unfortunately, there just aren't many ideas on display worthy of hanging a feature film on, making for a disappointing outing from one of the modern masters of cinema. If this is indeed Tarantino's penultimate effort, hopefully his swansong will return to the quality of his previous works.", "Just kept waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting": "I love Tarantino. I was super excited to see this. The movie started. And then it went. And I waited for the plot. And then it came and went within the last 15 minutes of the film. Then I left confused and a little disappointed.The movie just felt like Tarantino wanted to show off how much he knows about film history and how nostalgic the old Hollywood made him feel. The acting was amazing. The cinematography was amazing. The storyline just wasn't there though. I want to say I loved it so bad but it just felt so flat to me.The characters didn't really develop at all. Leo's character just kind of changed halfway through with only a narration as to why he was different. Brad Pitts character was the exact same the entire film. Margot Robbie's characters development was that she finally said like 20 words at the very end.The ending was the most enjoyable part without a doubt. That felt like a classic Tarantino scene. The rest of it though just felt like a normal movie. The dialogue didn't feel like him to me for the most part, with the exception of a few scenes. The soundtrack was phenomenal and caught the vibe of the movie flawlessly.Maybe I was just hoping for more or maybe I missed out on something. It was an enjoyable movie, but it just felt off to me. I really hope he will make a final movie to end his career with a bang, because this is not the one", "A meandering masterpiece ... I didn't want it to end": "This is such an unusual movie. It doesn't really have a plot ... it's kind of like a \"day in the life of a fading Hollywood TV actor\", but still it's just fascinating to watch. The acting, cinematography and production values for capturing the late 60s (and really ... dawn of the 70s) are about as good as you'll ever see. It's just art.And when it comes the ending ... wow. Especially if you know a bit of history. It's intense and amazing and I'll just leave it at that.That said, it is a little male-biased by modern standards, but it's capturing the mentality of a different time period. DiCaprio and Pitt play two wildly different characters that you just want to keep watching to see they do next. They will quite possibly win Oscars for their performances -- and Tarantino will no doubt be up for best director, best original screenplay and best film.If you enjoy Tarantino's moviemaking style - the dialog, the visuals, the period details and, yes ... the violence ... this is a must see. It's almost 2 and 3/4 hours - but I would have gladly stayed longer.BTW, if you stay a minute into the end-credits, there's a post credit scene followed by a fun radio (audio-only) contest commercial.", "A love letter to all that is Hollywood": "This movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. Rick Dalton has quickly become on of my favorite characters of all time! Leo lights the screen on fire every time we are with him. He is the ultimate package in this by giving Rick so much depth. Pitt does an amazing job as well. Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It's nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing. This is Tarantino at the height of his powers. He gets the best performance out of everyone in every part of this movie. There are a lot of very enjoyable smaller parts in this. It's also great to see him working with the second generation of actors and actresses he has worked with in the past. I was taken on a ride to every part of Hollywood in this. From the glitz and glamour to the dark and twisted. This movie has a really awesome third act that I wouldn't dream of spoiling. I consider it a cherry on top of an already perfect movie. The directing, writing, music, cinematography, acting were all on point. It's a slow burn but all in all this movie is about Hollywood and the different aspects of it. The rising and falling of it's movie stars, and the people that flock to it in hopes of a different life. Go in with an open mind and let the movie take you on it's ride and you won't be disappointed.", "Oh so mediocre": "After all the hype around this film I was sorely disappointed. With an A List cast, as it had, it should have been Gold. The acting was terrific by Brad Pitt, Leonardo and Margot Robbie. The storyline sadly fell short, way short. The era was captured really well however I sat through the first hour thinking it was painting the scene and that the real action would start. I kept thinking that until the last 20 minutes when things finally came together, however, that was nearly 3 hours of film to sit through before any real appearance of the film I was expecting.", "Once upon a time ... in Tarantino's head.": "'Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood (2019)' is disappointing. Frankly, it's just not very good. It not only lacks substance, it lacks style. The story meanders, the characters don't change, the plot-lines don't gel and the entire thing just feels like a bit of a wasted opportunity. It doesn't seem to be about anything, really. It's as if Tarantino decided to set a film in Hollywood in the 60s, then started writing and just didn't stop until he'd ran out of paper. Don't get me wrong, the filmmaking is on relatively fine form; the camera-work is assured, the cinematography is clean, the set-design and costuming are cohesive and the performances are all pretty much perfect. It's just the storytelling that's subpar. Rather than showing any real reverence for the period, the piece appears to despise it - or, at least, have no respect for it. I mean, you just have to look at the much-discussed Bruce Lee scene to see that (seriously, what's his problem with Bruce Lee?). This would be a strange stance for any cinephile to take, let alone perhaps pop-culture's most renowned cinephile, and it does make you wonder why Tarantino even bothered to dip into the cinematic history that he has so often aped. It's not even as if it's some sort of satire, which could have had the potential to work. Instead, it honestly comes across as fodder to feed an ego; most of the time, it's either like we're directly being given a history lesson or indirectly being told what would have happened if the writer-director was around back then. The alternate-history angle is perhaps the most intriguing thing about the entire enterprise, but it's mostly squandered on childish caricatures or tired machoism. In either case, it's inconsequential outside of enabling the two core characters to exist in a more-or-less recognisable 'real world'. The biggest changes don't hold any proper 'what if' weight because their aftermath is never explored and the characters they most keenly affect aren't really characters at all. This sadly includes Sharon Tate. It's bizarre that a story which apparently started with the intent of exploring and celebrating her very real life instead ended up focusing on two entirely made-up men. Tate gets no real agency and has a limited role, mainly serving to remind the audience of the odd fact/fiction dynamic and the looming Manson threat. While I'm on the subject and without spoiling anything, it's safe to say that the picture ends in quite a bit of bloodshed - if not in the way you expect. It's arguably Tarantino's most violent - or, I suppose, 'sadistic' - piece, mainly because of its apparent realism and accompanying brutality. The thing is that it's just so unnecessary and unnecessarily gratuitous, actually feeling unjustified in its near-glamorisation. There's this uncomfortable sense of 'revenge', I guess. I'm not one to squirm at on-screen violence, either - I haven't flinched at any of Tarantino's previous efforts, for example. The strange thing is that the flick also makes a point of getting involved with the age-old 'movie violence vs real violence' debate, depicting its 'real violence' as much more disturbing than its 'movie violence' but also going out of its way to have a few characters name 'movie violence' as the inspiration for their attempts at 'real violence'. The messaging is mixed, to say the least, and will do the filmmaker no favours when it comes to journalists poking at his stance on the matter. At least, I suppose, there's an awareness of theme in this aspect, however unhelpful its conclusion may be. The rest of the picture doesn't seem to have any semblance of this, settling instead for a scene-by-scene sort of thing that never really comes together. In a way, there's a plot but there's not a narrative (loosely speaking). Some of it is quite entertaining, to be fair. It's not exactly boring but it's not exactly engaging, either. The best stuff involves Dalton shooting a guest-spot on a western TV show; these scenes are fairly enjoyable, bring out the best in DiCaprio and feature a 'film within a film' that's probably more fun than the film itself. The sequences with Booth just feel like an extended B-plot, with no real drive behind them. The feature eventually gives up and skips forward a huge chunk of time, opting to use narrated exposition to fill in the gap and then over-explain a faster-paced final third. Interestingly, the stuff that is skipped appears as if it could have made for a more-than-decent story that actively changes the core characters. The final movement moves faster but it isn't any more compelling. Plus, by the time you get there, you've not got the energy to care. Overall, the picture is unfocused and unimpressive. It has its merits, of course, and the performances really are top-notch. However, it's not particularly entertaining and it's actually rather predictable. It's quite problematic, too; it has an undercurrent of unpunished, hero-perpetrated violence against women, for example. 5/10", "A dazzling time in Hollywood": "'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' sounded like it would be a great film from the get go. Although Quentin Tarantino's films have been spotty in recent years, his best work such as 'Reservoir Dogs' and especially 'Pulp Fiction' are masterpieces. The cast consists of many immensely talented actors. It looked great from the advertising and who cannot help resist that title. That it was one of the year's most positively received films further added to the interest.Although it is not quite perfect, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' to me was as great as hoped. One of Tarantino's best in direction, writing and as a film as an overall whole in recent years, towards the better end of his filmography and one of 2019's best films, its positive reception richly deserved. It is unmistakable Tarantino in a good way and a great representation of the cast, with many giving some of their best work in recent years.Will start with the very, very few things that didn't quite come off for my tastes. Some of the pace, especially for a film as long as it was, could have tightened and not every scene felt necessary. Actually would have trimmed some or all of Sharon Tate in the cinema, regardless of how beguiling the production values and Margot Robbie's (that smile is a beauty) acting were.Did think too that the Bruce Lee caricature and encounter were quite tasteless and anybody who was offended can't be blamed.That sounds like a film worth a 7 or 8 out of 10. The good things though were so amazing and the film was in a different league to a lot of films released this year that to me awarding 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' either of those scores felt too low. It looks wonderful, dazzlingly shot with shots filled to the brim with atmosphere, stylishly edited with a lovingly recreated period. Tarantino directs with great confidence and his distinctive style is all over it. The music is used sparingly, but the music choices are very effective when used. Particularly so the quite sinister use of \"Twelve Thirty\" in a scene that already makes one feel unnerved.Script has the hard-boiled edge necessary and has entertainment and intensity. A word of warning, there is a lot of profanity (am mentioning this because this is something that bothers people) but to me it didn't feel as gratuitous as feared. Some pacing issues aside, the story is often absorbing and is quite nostalgic and daring with expert melding of fact and fiction. A few great scenes are everything to do with the making of the western with Rick and the girl (fans of classic-era westerns will enjoy it, likewise anybody with super fond memories of episodic television), Cliff's truly chilling encounter at the Spahn Movie Ranch and the splendidly over the top (and extremely violent just to warn you) finale in true Tarantino style.Found the characters to be interesting, with Rick and Cliff being quite meaty roles. The acting is exemplary, Leonardo DiCaprio is charisma and intensity personified and Brad Pitt, here the epitome of cool, has not been this good in years. Margot Robbie is absolutely radiant with a smile that lights up the screen. Bruce Dern, Damian Lewis and Al Pacino provide delicious support in small roles.In conclusion, the odd pacing issue and one tasteless scene aside this was a great film. 9/10", "Boring, boring, boring. Self-complacent ramblings about nothing": "To say that this movie is self-complacent would be a gigantic understatement. As gigantic maybe as Tarantino's memory, overloaded with scores of details that he doesn't care to sort out. So he unloads them in bulk. The result : it's like you go to a promising party but end up cornered most of the night by some drunk guy who absolutely wants to share his opinions about everything.Right from the start you get vignette after vignette, self-indulgent, overlong spoof sequences that bog down the main narrative. What with all the stuff Tarantino has learnt about movies he can't shorten exposition to clever ellipses ? Once upon a time I thought he was very good with dialogue, but I guess it is no fun to toil and write fine lines (no just snappy one-liners from time to time) when Sony will greenlight anything you want to shoot.Once upon a time in Hollywood does not have a plot. It is the New Wave auteur in Tarantino who does not think he needs a plot. He has a couple of characters, a dozen anecdotes and the rest is talent. Self-conscious talent, lazy talent, talent isolated in the middle of a creative process. More like naked skills, each trying separately to express its full potential.The hero and his sidekick are losers: how do you build a story around losers ? You need rhythm and some kind of McGuffin (wasn't it all there in Pulp Fiction?), not some vague exploration of the meaning of life. The plot is limited to the draft premise: a has-been TV actor and his stunt double cope with reality in Hollywood around the time of the Manson Family murders.\nThe backdrop of the murders is the only narrative asset. We are teased all along, we even have an extensive reconstitution of life at the Spahn Ranch... all this just to toy around and end with the kind of ultra-violent carnival that Tarantino fans seem to revere.\nClearly the challenge of mentioning the sordid Tate-LaBianca murders of August 1969 was not only above Tarantino's mental ability, but grossly using background anecdotes from it as fodder for his inspiration was within his moral scope.As always I am judging this movie on its merits from a movie enthusiast point of view. But Tarantino is much more than a movie enthusiast. He is a guttonous movie fanatic. He is a guru with followers who let themselves be impressed, just like with Charles Manson. Many more followers than Charles Manson; fortunately Tarantino followers are only trained to see the fun in violence.", "The more you appreciate cinema as an art, the more you will like this film": "I would like to preface this review by expressing that I didn't particularly love this film as much as I expected to. Like many others, Tarantino is one of my favorite directors. I respect his fundamental consistency and his creative license above all else, and he lets both of those aspects shine through brightly in his 9th undertaking. It was this particular flavor of storytelling that he used this time around that I wasn't fond of. There was nothing difficult to follow about it, but it just didn't want to piece itself together into any coherent arcs. I can certainly appreciate that this was the feel Tarantino was going for, but it was not one I could appreciate during my viewing. With that being said, the story wraps up into a bizarre, unique, and satisfying conclusion that reminded me why I will always be in theaters for this director. What makes Tarantino so great is that he maintains such sound film fundamentals when taking on these strange and creative projects. His actors blew their roles out of the water, his cinematographer enhanced their potent performances further, and his set/costume decorators crafted a world of immersion. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a film everyone will love, but it is a film everyone should see.", "No spoilers": "I can't spoil this movie because there's nothing to spoil!!! No plot. Nothing happens. If I submitted this same screenplay to Hollywood it would get rejected.", "A movie that will be misunderstood": "Here's why not everyone will like this movie: it's not like all of Tarantino's other movies, and it's not like any modern movies either. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a melancholy, slow burning, comedic love letter to an age of Hollywood that we find ourselves disconnect from nowadays.The point of this movie isn't to be just like Pulp Fiction and tell stories that have no meaning. In fact, I would argue that Tarantino wants each and every story to have a meaning. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a faded action star struggling to hold onto his career and fame. Every scene he was in was enjoyable, as he internally argues with himself to be better than he is. He can't find work except for as a typecast villain, and turns down an offer to go overseas initially because he thinks it's too far a step down from his past career. Dalton's story was not as fun to me as his stunt double, Cliff Booth's (Brad Pitt), but I will get to that in a minute. Dalton's story, some will say, was boring, overdrawn, and pointless. I say it was the most important and interesting storyline in the movie. Rick is an alcoholic, and deals with a lot of anger towards himself, particularly in his trailer (you'll see what I mean), and the long scenes showing him act out his part as the villain in the western are extremely entertaining as DiCaprio does some brilliant work letting us see Dalton as an actor without losing touch with him by slipping into acting of his own. He finally decides to go overseas, but most of that time is spent in a montage. When he returns, he dons a new Italian wife and an entirely new fashion straight from Europe. He doesn't do much towards the end, except for burn a manson follower alive in his pool, and then he finally becomes friends with his neighbors. I'll also get to that when I talk about Sharon Tate. Rick is representative of Hollywood at the time of 1969, and unless you are familiar with film history, that will be lost on you. In 1969 movies like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, and The Graduate were changing the face of Cinema by eroding censorship codes and finally getting the studios to hand the reigns to directors, thus entering the age of auterism. Actors like Rick were becoming absolete in film for a number of reasons, but mainly that they hadn't had to search for work whilst under the studio system, they just signed a contract and found work immediately. Roman Polanski, his neighbor, was one of the directors that was now given a lot of free reign in this age, . Dalton's character expressed the frustration many probably felt at the time, and Tarantino built a character that was beautifully acted by DiCaprio.Cliff Booth on the other hand, was the most Tarantino character in the movie. I think he'll be the fan favorite, because he requires no historical context or empathy to understand. He's a stunt double who lives much worse than his star, Dalton, and is a no-no sense badass with a muddled past. His scenes were incredibly fun, as Pitt brought a certain energy to each scene that glued you to the screen waiting for his next move. Particularly at the end, when Tex had him at gunpoint and he was tripping on acid. Obviously he had the situation under control, but we as the audience have no idea until he sicks the dog on them. Booth was a character you expect to see in a Tarantino movie. None of his storyline was used for what people will say is \"pointless\", mainly because he is the most involved with the Manson clan.Interestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. Charles himself only shows up twice, and only says a few words. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn't play to the audience the way we thought it would. It wasn't a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected.Which brings me to my last point, and that is of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Her role, while a tad less utilized than I expected, was Central because the real life Tate was murdered by the Manson clan. If you go in as an audience member with that knowledge, you go the whole movie waiting for something to happen to her, and it never does. Tate herself was a happy, blooming actress who spent time with friends and danced (a lot). This carefree manner was underlying a want to be famous, as she tells people who she is and is clearly disappointed when they don't recognize her. Tate plays a role in this story of showing the era of actors now replacing Rick Dalton, and also showing special to Hollywood, the silver screen's allure. As this is essentially a long love letter to Hollywood, Tarantino pens what drew him to the screen through Tate.With all of its references, obscure or in your face, there is a delicious amount to absorb, especially for cinefiles. Tarantino has the viewer to sit back, eat up the screen, and imagine we are right there with the characters in a wonderfully painted portrait of a Hollywood long gone. This movie will be misunderstood because of the expectations for the Manson murders, and because audiences nowadays expect action on every corner, which Tarantino's name can be attached to in some capacity. Without any crazy special effects to speak, simply a fantastic script and acting, I think many audience members will get bored or not understand why it's entertaining to others. I personally think it's one of Tarantino's best, if not his absolute best, and will stand the test of time for movie lovers everywhere. Agree or disagree, we all have to admit that Brad Pitt's dog was awesome.", "Tarantino meets realism": "This is a typical Tarantino style film, violent and funny. The jokes are throughout the film and the violence steps in when dealing with hippies. On the other hand, the film is also quite realistic and offers a sharp sarcasm towards Hollywood, stars and hippies. Pitt is handsome as ever, and DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of his career. The screenplay and editing are phenomenal.", "Why 161 minutes?": "I can't deny it ... I'm an avid Quentin Tarantino admirer, and I will probably always remain an avid Quentin Tarantino admirer. The man simply is a genius when it comes down to writing dazzling dialogues, getting the most out of stellar ensemble casts and depicting extreme but delirious violence. QT also always was the only director of whom I tolerated exaggeratedly long movies. \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Kill Bill\", \"Inglorious Bastards\", etc, it never bothered me that they lasted two and a half hours. But since, say, \"Django Unchained\", I'm noticing an increasingly worrying trend when I watch his newest movies. They are getting too long and far too tedious. They are generally still fine films, but when re-watching, I find myself fast-forwarding the overlong dialogues and only focusing on the violent parts. In case of \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\", I'm afraid I'll be skipping the full first two hours!It's interesting to watch once, perhaps, but the fan-boy fantasy tale of \"Hollywood in the Sixties\" that Tarantino penned down is honestly quite dull, repetitive and substantially void. It's literally just endlessly long sequences of Leonardi DiCaprio (a washed-up TV-western idol from the 50s) rehearsing his lines for a new show, Brad Pitt (an unemployed stunt double) feeding his dog and cruising around LA to pick up young hippie girls, and Margot Robbie (as Sharon Tate) parading around town and looking at herself on the big screen. You probably read it before in other reviews, but it's a sad truth: absolutely nothing interesting happens, and some sequences - notably when Brad Pitt \"trespasses\" into the hippie trailer park - are even downright pathetic. The last forty minutes are fabulous, though. You may regain consciousness as soon as you see the message \"6 months later\" appear on the screen. As an enormous fan of Italian exploitation of the sixties & seventies, I really adored how Tarantino sent DiCaprio's actor character to Rome and star in exhilarating trash titles like \"Nebraska Jim\", \"Shoot Ringo, said the Gringo\" or \"Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!\". When returning to their home in the Hollywood Hills, they are confronted with members of the notorious Manson Family that are out to kill Sharon Tate and her friends, but Quentin Tarantino gives history a sort of absurdly cool twist. The climax isn't so surprising or innovative if you have seen \"Inglourious Bastards\", but at least it finally provides the movie with what I had desperately been anticipating for more than two hours: sick, extreme and unhinged violence!", "If Only It Was True.......": "Outstanding film with great acting by all involved; definetly some best acting Oscar nominations in the near future. Bruce Dern has a small part, but is so natural in it, that he briefly steals the film. If only the ending really happened........", "That's how it was": "Quentin Tarantino has given us a masterpiece with an historic teaming of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. The two really work well together and that's\nhalf the secret of this film.The other half is incredible detail to the period of this movie which takes place in\n1969 Hollywood. DiCaprio plays a former western star who would like to get his\ncareer jump started again. I remember back in the 50s and early 60s television\nwas saturated with westerns. DiCaprio is playing one of those stars and westerns had gone into a decline as public taste has changed. But there are a\nfew being made still and DiCaprio is shooting an episode in Lancer.Back in the day Brad Pitt was his stunt double and now he's gotten older and\nheavier and he's a iconoclastic sort.and he's essentially DiCaprio's entourage.\nThese two are so great together in every scene they're both in.As it turns out DiCaprio lives in a Beverly Hills cul-de-sac and his neighbors are\nRoman Polanski and his wife the ill fated Sharon Tate played her by Margot Robbie. There's this aura of tragedy that Tarantino creates around her and her\nfriend hairstylist to the star Jay Sebring played by Emile Hirsch. For one who\nin her short career played some sexpots there's a sweet innocence in Robbie's\nportrayal of Tate.Also note good performances by Al Pacino as a producer always on the cutting\nedge of new trends in the business. And Bruce Dern is unforgettable as George Spahn who owned the movie ranch property where many westerns were shot back in the day. Dern has a memorable scene with Pitt.There might definitely be some Oscars in this one. See it by all means.", "An incredibly shocking history told in an incredible alternate way (DiCaprio and Pitt 10/10)": "I don't know why critics are being so harsh on the ending. For me, and for most people/fans I feel, it was awesome! Tarantino's always been a collage artist, a man cobbling together new stories from shards of the odd bit of cult culture here and there, and Hollywood sees him fully embracing that mode.This approach lets Tarantino cut loose, which is probably to the film's benefit, especially as we center on DiCaprio and Pitt as his leads. It's a bizarre thing to see former teen heartthrobs like these two suffer and flail about their closing careers, or to hear so many people call Pitt's character \"old.\" (As one shirtless scene shows us, even old Pitt can still get it.) Of the two, Dalton has a harder time with it, his ego comically wrapped around the idea of his career fading. In one of his latest guest stints as a heavy on a Western, he connects briefly with his precocious eight-year-old co-star (an unstoppable Julia Butters) who reinvigorates his confidence as an actor, especially after an explosive breakdown in his trailer.DiCaprio is having particularly garish fun here, ripping into his signature Jordan Belfort-era intensity and turning his washed-up TV star into a petulant, gurning child, as you do when you're forced to contemplate cranking out spaghetti Westerns in Rome to keep your career afloat. On the other end of the spectrum is Pitt, all Southern drawl and stoicism, the kind of unstoppable Billy Jack figure who can fight to a draw with Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) and even hold his own in some tense confrontations with the Manson family. The two are gangbusters together, evincing even in their quiet moments the camaraderie of two men who've spent their lives together, Cliff being \"more than a best friend and a little less than a wife\" to Rick. They shine even when they split apart for their separate stories - Rick's guest spot on Lancer and Cliff's unexpected detour to the Manson Ranch - but each feels of a piece with the other.As for the Mansons themselves, they play a much more peripheral part in Hollywood than one might expect from a gore-lover like Tarantino. Instead, they're another layer to the gonzo tapestry he's woven, a group of young nutcases who've taken over Spahn Ranch (where the fictional Bounty Law was shot) and who give the older Cliff no amount of discomfort. They're a group of kids resentful of the largesse of Hollywood, who want to \"kill the people who taught us to kill\" through violent TV shows and movies; as one of cinema's foremost purveyors of bloodshed, it's a bold move for Tarantino to take.And yet, that self-reflexivity beats at the heart of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a film made by a man who sees his own obsolescence coming. Just as Cliff and Rick barrel inexorably toward the \"end of the trail\" for their partnership and the era of Hollywood that would take them in, so too does Tarantino see the same for himself. It's tempting to read it as an \"old man yells at cloud\" feature, with its characters' many resentments toward young bucks taking their jobs. But it's just as easy to imagine Tarantino owning up to the limitations of your age and range, instead tipping his hat and riding off into the sunset. He's got one more film in him, but even if this were Tarantino's swan song, it wouldn't be a bad note to go out on.", "Love QT but Painful boring self-indulgence": "Even great actors can't save this storyless plotless meandering piece of self-indulgent nostalgia. It looks like they had a great time making it and to heck wirh the audience. I love the old-time movie feel of most of QTs films, but come on, you need a plot. You need to tell a story. As QT famously said a movie should make you want to sit down over a piece of pie afterwards and talk about it. Soon as our\ngroup walked out all anyone had to say was how painfully boring and self-indulgent it was. That was it. QT you gave us nothing to talk about.", "Excellent epic a throwback to yesterday of a golden era of culture, fame, struggle and friendship.": "Once again Quentin Tarantino has done it another long and in depth film(almost three hours long for this one!) as the director mixes plot and stories that blend both drama, comedy, and action all in one. Again as is common in any film of Tarantino's is the cast is always all star and a memorable ensemble and it seems the acting and chemistry is always in top form. And this might be the director's finest film to date for it's look back in time to a memorable yesteryear era!\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is set in 1969 at the height and end of Hollywood's golden age an era of free spirits and cultural uprising. It follows the life of one Rick Dalton(in fine form from Leonardo DiCaprio) a past his prime and faded TV actor who now struggles even to get small parts in TV westerns, and Dalton seems hopeless yet he's still friends with his buddy and partner in crime that being his stunt double Cliff Booth(Brad Pitt). The two burn plenty of midnight oil together still a ray of light is found when Rick gets a second chance and a rebirth by doing international pictures and marrying an Italian beauty.In somewhat of a wild card and subplot story Dalton's neighbor is the sexy and young actress Sharon Tate(Margot Robbie) who spices and lightens up the screen as a young star in the making. Also introduced is the strange and notorious Charles Manson. The film even has a surprise and happy ending! Overall excellent well done epic that pays homage to the past as it's a showcase of different stories that connects up with different characters.", "Well... it's official ol buddy... we got an instant frickin' classic on our hands! 10/10 \u2b50": "Believe the hype. Believe the 10 star reviews. OUATIH exceeds every expectation with its mind-blowing attention to detail, superb dialogue, incredible performances and, most of all, its overwhelming love for the movies. Tarantino's illustrious career has culminated in this stylishly nostalgic journey that takes us back to everything great about the 60s. Every detail of this period is done to a tee; and it's in all the most minute aspects, whether it be a can of dog food or a radio station, where this film is elevated to masterpiece status.Remember when Jules and Vincent instantly became one of cinemas classic duos in Pulp Fiction? You can now confidently say the same thing about Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth - Leo and Brad give performances of a lifetime as these endearing, hilarious and, at times, even heart-rending characters. They're joined by a beyond stellar supporting group that's filled beautifully by the likes of Margot Robbie, Timothy Oliphant, Al Pacino, (the late) Luke Perry, Emile Hirsch and many more who all breathe life into this wonderfully unique and engaging story.All in all, it's a fantastic dive into the Golden Age that's fulls of twists at every turn and shines even brighter in its quieter moments when it's love for everything old cinema is at the forefront of its telling. At its core, it's invigorated by a guy whose talent as a storyteller is exceeded only by his sheer love for film and that is Mr. Quentin Tarantino. And for anyone who thinks the runtime could/should have been shorter, remember that QT was trying to make many of us who had never grown up/experienced that era (like myself) feel close to it. This meant every seemingly trivial scene/moment's sole purpose was to create as authentic an atmosphere as he could've conjured up.It's as ambitious a vision as one could muster and he truly nailed it with flying colors, creating a fairytale that enthrals you in ways you never knew were possible. I hope he's lying when he says he's ready to call it quits but I'll be damned if this isn't the best way possible to go out. It's official ol buddy... we got a darn frickin classic on our hands!", "Give Brad Pitt the Oscar": "Great buddy movie about a Hollywood B-List actor and his trusty stunt double on the eve of the Sharon Tate Murders. The script by Tarantino is absolutely fantastic and in my opinion his best script. It never feels like a Tarantino movie until the finale. Brad should get the Oscar for his work as the trusty stunt double who has a problem with the law but is also the authority figure of the film. Hollywood is full of people who gave their lives to the industry who never got the recognition they deserved or had careers cut short, and this movie is for them.", "\"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" is a cinematic masterpiece.": "There hasn't been a movie-going experience like \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" in many years. An epic love letter to everything Hollywood that only Tarantino could helm. A flat-out masterpiece.In this dark comedy-drama, a faded television actor and his stunt double strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry in 1969 Los Angeles.Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's attention to detail has always been one of his many trademarks, but in \"Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood\" his focus never steers away from capturing the essence of 1969 Los Angeles. DiCaprio and Pitt are a match made in heaven; their performances are some of the best of their careers, respectively. Margot Robbie is sensational as Sharon Tate and really capturing her aura. The film altogether is Tarantino's magnum opus and if this is his final original film, he knocked it out of the park. \"Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood\" is the best film I've seen this year and I can't wait to see it again.Do not miss this film.", "Quentin Tarantino's best film ever!": "Nearly everything is memorable and done with perfection! There is so much good in this movie, I barely have any complaints at all (Rick Dalton) Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing and omg (Cliff Booth) Brad Pitt is one of the best actors ever! I'm not the type to spoil things, especially something that is a pure enlightening blast I will just say there's a lot of great homages and trivia that I figured out easily - I hope others notice the many cool things too. Such an excellent cast throughout and soundtrack; this better get nominated it deserves so much! Easily in my top favorite films ever made too. Also this is my 380th review on here!", "Finding Fame and Violence in Hollywood": "This has everything I'd ever want from a Tarantino movie and more. It is one of the most Tarantinoy Tarantino movies in every aspect (just try to count how many bare feet shots there are, I dare you), and it's a film I'm already itching to see again. While I won't say it's better than \"Pulp Fiction\", for a massive fan of both the Golden Age of Hollywood and Tarantino himself, it's practically perfect and still wholly earns its 5 Star rating.", "The Oscar Race has begun!": "Best Picture, Director, Actors, Writing, Costume, Screenplay, Score, Production Design and on and on and on! All movies from this point forward will be compared/judged against this film. Don't miss this one.", "Happy endings are Oh! Sooo satisfying! Bravo!": "For those of us old enough to remember the Manson 'episode' of California's and Hollywood's histories, and simultaneously young enough to have been inalterably shaken by that horror, OUaTiH is a justifiably satisfying re-write that exploits everything we love about movies and Hollywood, while suppressing the gross underbelly of humanity.The two A-list leads are our heroes! Bravo to Hollywood for building-up the 'hero worship' genre and to Tarantino for grabbing-on to it and faithfully stoking it for such a satisfying climax! Pitt deserves another Oscar nod for just being the golden-haired, low-key, stoic hero who separates what's important from what is not, and is just what we need at a time when everything else seems to he crumbling around us. Simultaneously, Tarantino glorifies the peppy pretty girls, the free spirits of the era, the mediocre TV and film efforts, and a sampling of iconic movie theaters of the time (and an excellent portrayal of the automotive mediocrity), while driving us down memory lane.Kudos! You will enjoy. A little slow in some places, otherwise...Yay!!", "Once....is a fairy tale. With a fairy tale ending.": "To those who hated the ending I can only say that when the scene ended I leaned to my wife and said..if only that's really what happened.\nIf only...\nIf only life were a fairy tale where the wolf doesn't eat the pigs.", "Must See Many Times": "This is without a doubt the Best Picture of the Year. Not only because it will deserve it, but just like Green Book last year they have nailed the MARKETING for the Film . Only thing, I recommend that your Butt hits the chair at the theatre right before the Movie Starts. Although I appreciate the Trailers for upcoming Films as much as the next Guy, with a 2 hour and 41 minute Movie, need to be Fresh ? Maybe they should have a quick Intermission ? So, Unless a International Indy Film comes out that is Fabulous before Oscars time, or someone does something Stupid to ruin it, this Film will prevail . Also Hats off to Kurt Russell on the Voice Over.I will be rooting for Quentin Tarantino, the Lead Actors and Team, bound to be up for some Oscars as well as the Fabulous Soundtrack ! Update: Read the Book, Watched the Extra Scenes Well Done ! Wish I could ask about the Chicken Wing ??", "Masterfully Shot, Expertly Acted and it Features Groovy 1960s Hollywood Style for Days": "Once Upon has so much style, the environments the movie is set it are gorgeous. The sets look amazing, the costuming is unique (and although I didn't grow up in the 1960s, it looked period accurate?) and flashy. It might be an overused phrase, but I was transported into this world filled with dreams and imagination yet had so little substance. The movie does a great job of wowing you with how cool Hollywood was yet also showing the not-so-pretty parts of the love child movement that was taking over (there's a bunch of shots of dirty feet....because why?). Its fantastic work with the visuals and the cinematography that looks fantastic, even the TV productions that Dalton is \"acting\" in are shot in an interesting and captivating. I expected nothing less but I still left the movie impressed.I didn't know a movie about a famous set of murders could be so comedic? This movie is part drama, part thriller but its almost a slice-of-life set in late 1960s Hollywood. The movie is more about the characters, there isn't much emphasis on the plot and you're more just spending time with these characters as they float through their lives. There were points where I just forgot that time was even progressing, it seems like it could take place over just a couple of days. I was okay with this but it made the movie feel almost like we were watching a dream. I didn't have a problem with this decision but it did leave the movie kind of directionless, I was enjoying the ride but there were a couple of times where I was asking myself, where is this movie going? When you've got such a funny and colourful cast of characters, you're going to be having fun either way but Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood operates on its own wavelength instead of following the conventional.This movie is full of amazing actors, do you think I'm going to complain about the acting? DiCaprio and Pitt are excellent together and apart, I'm just impressed at how funny DiCaprio is when he wants to be, when did that become a thing? They're equally good even though I thought Pitt gave the best performance. Margot Robbie was really good but how she was used in this was a weird choice. Its not a \"cameo\" but she's separated so much from everyone else except Hirsch that I thought she was almost set up as a metaphor for innocence or an allegory for the dream-like lustre that Hollywood possesses. She's really good but I can't say she stole the show, she has little dialogue and is just dancing through a lot of her scenes. You have Margaret Qualley next with the most screen time? She's very bubbly and brings some levity. My next favourite supporting performances came from Mike Moh, Maya Hawke and Timothy Olyphant who are all good and funny in their appearances.So while the movie is largely pretty upbeat with occasional dark moments, the ending is very much what you picture a climax in a Tarantino production. It goes bananas and even if you know the story of Manson family, it doesn't go where you expect. Although I enjoyed the rest of the movie, it was both fitting and it injected some tension. The creative team knows how to build things up and things ramp up big time in those final few scenes. Despite the movie mostly being comedic, I was surprised how worried I was for our main players and that much more surprise when things went a different direction. Minus there being some typical over-the-top beats, it was an excellent capper to this movie and it helped Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood gain some more of Tarantino's flavour.I left the theatre in a bit of a daze after seeing this one. I enjoyed almost every aspect of it, the writing, directing, acting, costuming and makeup and even the pace were all taught and well done on the whole. Did I dig every single aspect of it? No but if that's your benchmark for an excellent movie, you're probably disappointed whenever you go to the movies. I liked this better than The Hateful Eight and I would put it up against any other film in Tarantino's recent output. I'd like to see it again to work out some of my deeper questions about it but for now I'd definitely recommend it to Tarantino fans and newcomers alike. Its one of Quentin's more accessible movies and while it does have really violent moments, other than the ending, its not too bad throughout. Some of the references definitely went over my head but I don't think that will interrupt your enjoyment of the movie. Despite the long run time, I thought this movie breezed by me and I'm happy to rate it at a 9/10.", "Not for Fast and Furious and Transformers fans": "If you start heading for the exits if a movie goes five minutes without a car chase or an explosion and subtitles immediately turn you off from a movie, don't see this film. You know who I'm talking about.This is a true time traveler movie. The audience is taken back in time to 1969 Hollywood to spend time with the lead actor and stuntman Richard Dalton and Cliff Booth. It's quite incredible, would love to see someone do this with Las Vegas in the past, I go there a lot and the history of the place is fascinating. I enjoy movies in which the director takes time and care trying to recreate the past. I view it as kind of a sport. If you want to see a production that absolutely failed at reproducing the eighties, watch the first season of Narcos and play spot the historical anachronisms. It's brutal. It's better if you were born around that time. People born in the nineties and 2000s don't understand. They've lived with cellphones their whole life. That and the internet pretty much changed the world significantly.I appreciated the movie. It's classic Tarantino. I'd have to say that it's his best since Django Unchained, which was his best since Jackie Brown. Kill Bill and Inglorious were awful. I don't care. Django was good but I was worried he was starting to enjoy the violence in his films too much. Once Upon in Hollywood has convinced me he can make a good movie without relying on that nonsense. The violence is there but it's few and far between. Not sure if Tarantino was worried it was costing him work but he did a great job controlling himself here.Definitely must-see unless you're the sort of person that pre-orders Michael Bay and Vin Diesel movie tickets.", "Did not disappoint \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d": "I just saw the movie.... I have to say \"Quentin Tarantino\" is a freaking genius.\nQuentin smartest move is partnering leo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt together... It's an amazing chemistry they have.. I love the whole dialogue lingo.. The whole reference to the 1960s.\nIt's extremely entertaining.. I was not bored for a minute..Brad Pitt looks A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! Jesus..\nIn my opinion even looks younger than DiCaprio,who is still handsome as well.\nI loved their characters especially brad pitts \"Cliff Booth\" character was so cool, so level headed that he just oozed that suave charismatic persona.\nDiCaprio was brilliant as\"stuttering Rick Dalton\"\nHe was the ying to Brad's yang.\nRicLeo DiCaprio was brilliant in expressing his frustration in one point in my opinion he was improvising on his trailer......\nBoth actors are amazing!!!!!\nI also loved the other characters especially\nMargo Robbie was brilliant as \"Sharon Tate\"\nShe oozed the same sweetness of the real Sharon Tate.. She was definitely the best choice for that character.\nMy favorite scene is when she goes to the movies to see herself acting and that sweet expression she had seeing the people enjoying her acting.....\nI would definitely recommend if you are a Tarantino fan do watch the movie It's interesting especially the end it's awesome!\nTwo thumbs up!!!!!!!!!", "Such a GREAT FILM!!!!": "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is such a fantastic movie! The 9th film by Quentin Tarantino DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! The cast made the movie even better. WONDERFUL CAST & STORYLINE!!! I honestly found this film to be so much better than Pulp Fiction!", "I DOUBTED THIS, I'M GLAD I WAS WRONG...!": "Quentin Tarantino's newest is another in his revisionist cinematic history lessons which by the initial trailers I was little worried about since I didn't get what kind of thrust the released product would be but shame on me for having any doubts. Taking place in the 1969, we get a glimpse of a world where Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor & his stunt double, Brad Pitt, live in & out of their respective pockets as they try to stay employed & more importantly relevant in Tinseltown where a sea change of creativity & change was now in full swing. DiCaprio's aging Western star is now making ends meet doing bit villain turns against other actors who's stars are in the ascendant while Pitt has to collect a paycheck being DiCaprio's all around valet & handyman since his days as a stunt performer (the surgical scars on his body belie the once buoyant heyday of his glory days while a rumor of his offing his wife still hangs over him like an albatross) seems to be in his rear-view. All of this would be enough for a pleasant narrative but we also have to deal w/the real life players in these characters' orbit like Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), an up & coming actress who's pregnant w/director Roman Polanski's child & more importantly Charles Manson's flower children who cross paths w/Pitt & who will play a historic part in the annals of Hollywood murder cases for all time. That the last sequence doesn't give historians the ending they were expecting is something Tarantino has mastered for the bulk of his career & it should be applauded rather than chided since truth in this case would be rote & expected giving this denouement a welcome cold water splash of irony. Look for Damian Lewis (Billions) as an uncanny doppelganger for Steve McQueen (I thought it was CG for a sec).", "Who Doesn't Love A Well-Trained Dog?": "Spoiler alert:Yeah . . .This movie may encourgage a lot of people to get a Pit Bull. To those people I say, \"Please adopt, please be kind to your dog and PLEASE obedience train your dog.\"\"Brandy\" (\"Sayuri\" in real life) is the canine who steals every scene she's in. What a terrific actor she is. I'm not alone in thinking she deserves the highest praise for her acting chops. Did you know?---- \"Perhaps that's why she won the film its only award at Cannes: the Palm Dog award. (Seriously.)\" (Vanity Fair article about Brandy.)Haha. GOOD dog. I would love to meet her.Along with Brandy, Tarantino's film has a lot going for it. Pitt and DiCaprio are utterly amazing in the movie.Their performances are top notch. I particularly enjoyed watching Pitt. His ability to lose himself in his role always pleases me.Pacino kind of rubbed me the wrong way, however, and I'm not sure why. He just didn't seem to mesh with the vibe of the story. It was like he was an afterthought, uncomfortably \"there,\" with a character he was unable to play. And I always like Pacino. This is his worst acting that I've seen, by far.As ever, I read nothing and knew nothing about this movie before viewing it. I do love a good surprise. It was fantastic to see all the cameos, the imitation Bruce Lee, the Old Hollywood neon signs. Wherever did they find the old signs? They look so perfect. I could swear some aren't just from old photos or film recordings.Tarantino has outdone himself with this. I like his retelling of the tale and I wish deep in my heart that Cliff and Brandy and Rick had been there to save Sharon Tate and the others from their grisly fate.Thanks for the excellent, ride, Quentin. I really really enjoyed it. Especially Brandy, the flamethrower, the humor and the happy ending.", "Laughter when needed!!": "This film is fantastic. Brad and Leo are fantastic. How anyone can see the title \"Once upon a time...\" and not get the point is beyond me. A Hollywood where bad things in the 60's could be scripted away. How wonderful. Wish they could do that now!!I have not laughed through a movie so much in years. I do agree that the film could be a bit shorter but not by much. Brilliant script, acting, direction. Loved the dog food!!", "Brad Pitt and Leonardo Di Caprio shine the brightest, Margot Robbie is sweet and sexy, and Quentin Tarantino has done his best work as a director in this movie": "\" Once upon a time in Hollywood \" is clearly and definitely one of the best movies of year 2019.Brad Pitt has always given cool, realistic type of performances - in this movie, he has given his coolest performance ever. Leonardo Di Caprio has always been great at playing troubled, complicated personalities. In this movie, he plays a fading actor who is trying to give his career a much needed upward boost. Margot Robbie is sweet and sexy as Sharon Tate. Even Al Pacino has managed to make the best out of the few scenes he has in this movie set in the year 1969. The real King over here is definitely director Quentin Tarantino. I feel that this movie is his best work till date. Everything that he has done to make this movie entertaining seems genuine.", "Maybe I did not get something...": "...but this was plain boring. Had to turn off after 40 mins of exactly zero happening.", "The Ending Was Satisfying": "For those who were so bored, Spiderman is still playing.For the adults in the room who remember not only the seventies but the horrific Tate-LaBianca murders by idiots with no ability to actually think for themselves, the what if ending was tremendously satisfying.Brad Pitt and DiCaprio were having a ball. The actress (she was DiCaprio's wife in The Wolf of Wall Street) who played Sharon Tate really calories the personna of Tate, who by many accounts was a lovely, sweet person.I saw this movie on a beautiful Saturday afternoon at 12:15 and the movie theater was packed. Great story, great acting all around, great real actor portrayals, and a satisfying, if only, ending.Oh, and don't forget the dog!", "A Modern Fairy Tale Tribute to Classic Hollywood's Departure": "Over the years, we've had numerous tributes to Hollywood's Golden age, but never to the extent of that era's tail end. Well, for his ninth film no less, Quentin Tarantino did just that, with an ensemble cast and his trademark love to his generation's culture. Taking place in 1969 during the rise of the hippie cult movement and the rapid changes the film industry went through, the film chronicles multiple storylines involving a fictional aging television actor named Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double/longtime friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as they experience all the changes going on in Hollywood, including that of a gripping cult spread around the place, as well as actress/model Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).What the film succeeds at the most in paying tribute to Hollywood during the late 60s is the look and aesthetic, down to the settings, landscapes and even how the movies and TV shows were shot back then. Many of the scenes displaying the shows and movies Rick Dalton and other actors appear in look and sound exactly like how they did back in the 60s, and given that the movie was shot on traditional film, it only adds in to the charming graininess and flair to it all. In addition, the performances are very strong, from Leo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt practically embodying their characters, and their chemistry with each other really feels like something of a natural bond between friends. The remaining cast range from eccentric and fascinating characters in their own right, such as Margaret Qualley, Julia Butters, Al Pacino and Kurt Russell, to spot on impersonations of real people, like Mike Joh as Bruce Lee, Timothy Olyphant as James Stacey, Emile Hirsch as Jay Sebring and Bruce Dern as George Spahn. The only actor who didn't seem to leave much of an impression was Margot Robbie, as her character was never given much material to truly shine, especially given that she was an Oscar nominated actress.Now with all that said, its time we talked about the actual cult hidden in the film, and that is the one and only Manson family. They are introduced when Cliff Booth drops off one of their members at their ranch, and the scene in particular just builds up the creepy factor with suspenseful albeit quiet tension and chilling atmosphere. Some of the members do show up towards the third act, and that's when all hell breaks lose. What's funny is that Tarantino announced this film as his own take on the Manson family murders, so the fact that he mixed it within a tale of actors coming to grips with Hollywood is shocking to say the least. I personally think they could have spent a little more time developing the Manson family arch as opposed to Rick Dalton's dangling career, because Sharon Tate was who they ended up murdering in real life, and Tate barely has enough screen time to serve much of a purpose to the feature anyway. Without giving away the climax, the film kind of pulls a historical 180 on the murderers themselves, meaning that there weren't many consequences to Tate as a character. But to its credit, the film still highlighted how ruthlessly sick the family was, so it gets some credibility for rewriting history in its own weird way.In terms of any other negatives though, the film is really slow in its pacing. Granted, for this film it kind of works due to the relatively serious subject matter of Hollywood actors working around the industry's standards, but there are times when it just meanders without going anywhere. In addition, one scene featuring Rick Dalton acting in one of his roles didn't commit to the style of 1960s tv quality, making it feel like a missed opportunity that looked confusing more than anything else. Also, for die hard Tarantino fans, you may be disappointed to find that his unique dialogue isn't as strong as the likes of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, not that the dialogue in this film was bad, but it seemed to lack a bit of that punch to make it worth remembering amongst other flicks he's made. On a more positive note though, being a Tarantino film, the choices of soundtrack fit the time period appropriately without ever feeling out of place, and they help elevate the tone well enough to make people feel nostalgic for the time period. Lastly, while I won't talk about the actual ending, it seemed to feel too fast paced compared to the film's generally patient flow, and the actual resolution, although satisfying, may have come at the expense of sacrificing the character's down to earth nature.So even though this is somewhat of a departure from the usual stuff we expect from Tarantino such as more upbeat pacing and liveliness and his punchy dialogue, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood still works as a glorifying tribute to the departure of American Cinema's golden age and a reminder of how messed up the Mansons truly were. Maybe it will turn off exuberant Tarantino fanatics, but for those who enjoy uniquely crafted narratives centered around a classic time period worth remembering, I think you'll be satisfied enough. And besides, this makes the 50th anniversary of 1969 and the Manson family murders that took place during said year, so it might stand the test of time after all.", "\"Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time.\"": "Well I'm a big Tarantino fan, but I have to say, this one missed the mark for me. I thought the movie's pacing was excruciating, as most of the time nothing seemed to be happening. I didn't know anything about the story going in, so as it unfolded I was able to figure out that it had something to do with the Manson Gang, which had me prepared for a typically violent crescendo as the story came to a climax. However the film opted for an alternate reality to the actual events of August, 1969. This version had the Manson followers wind up at the wrong house, to be met with a fading television actor and his regular stunt double, dishing out punishment in true Tarantino style. By that time, my only reaction was to laugh at the absurdity of it all, what with Brad Pitt hammering his victim mercilessly into any available furniture, while Leonardo DiCaprio whipped out his trusty flame thrower to nail the chick in the swimming pool. Not bad for the guy who broke down on the set of 'Lancer' when he couldn't deliver his lines right.In passing, the actors who portrayed Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee had an eerie way of channeling the former celebrities. Damian Lewis couldn't have been a better choice to mimic McQueen, he had the look and mannerisms that had me thinking he could have been the real deal. Mike Moh in some ways, looked more like Jason Scott Lee portraying Bruce Lee in the movie \"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\". I read that the family of Bruce Lee wasn't happy with the way Tarantino represented the former martial arts star in the film, but if that's the case, the same would have to be said of 'Dragon' because Jason Lee's interpretation to my mind was pretty much the same.For nostalgia fans like myself, the film has some merit in reliving the names of old time TV and movie programs like 'Mannix', and Steve McQueen's 'Wanted:Dead or Alive', reinvented for this picture as 'Bounty Law'. There's also the 'Lancer' spot with Timothy Olyphant portraying that series' star, James Stacy. Margot Robbie was stunning as Sharon Tate, and if Tarantino had been a little sharper, he might have thrown in a plug for the only Sharon Tate film I've ever seen, 1967's \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\". But unfortunately, just like that old horror comedy, this story was sooooo long, with interminable scenes stretching the distance from one point to another, it felt a lot like those old horse chase scenes did in 'B' Westerns from the Thirties and Forties.", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood": "It's an excellent representation of Hollywood in the late '60 with convincing performances. The movie is brilliantly shot with typical Tarantino Style and comedic dialogue. However, the movie doesn't have a certain plot, which may be boring to viewers at first sight, so i wouldn't recommend it if the plot is important to you. But, hey, give it a try. It's a movie that all cinephiles will love.", "A puzzle with 3 pieces, put together by pure coincidence.": "Puzzle piece number 1:\nSharon Tate and Roman Polanski. Through the movie they really don't do much. All they represent is a way for Rick Dalton to get out of his downward spiral. The viewer gets told this once at the start, and it stays back there lingering and waiting for it to enter the stage.Puzzle piece number 2:\nThe Manson \"Family\". They enter the story by complete coincidence. Cliff Booth sees this \"Hippy\" girl a few times and off we go on a journey outside the city. A fun one, that is not at all connected to the plot, but the perfect setup for the finale.Puzzle piece number 3:\nThe one and only, Rick Dalton. The once-star-now-alcoholic who gets all the roles that are really for the losers. How can he get out of it?Answer: He can't. And so the puzzle comes together. The puzzle put together by coincidence.\nCoincidence 1: Mason family go on murder tour at Ricks house.\nCoincidence 2: Rick lives next to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate.\nCouncidence 3: Cliff is there with his dog cause its their supposed last day together.And so 3 coincidences and 3 puzzle pieces form a fulfilling picture. Violence, fire and more violence and Rick is invited to Roman Polanski's house. Hurray, up Ricks and Cliffs careers go again.A hugely entertaining, very brilliant, though sometimes lenghty movie! 9/10.", "Best of 2019 so far": "The 9th film by Quentin Tarantino\nOnce upon a time in Hollywood seems to be Tarantino's most mature, laid back and easy going film. And I mean maturity as in the maturity of Tarantino as a filmmaker. This is very different than every other film of his, it doesn't rely on shock value (until the end anyway), it doesn't have super hardcore violence for the most part, it also doesn't have high tension sequences that we've come to expect from Tarantino, but that's doesn't disappoint you because that high tension galore isn't needed here. It's a comedy about two friends. A fading actor and his stuntman in the aftermath of the golden age of cinema, trying to fit in, in a rapidly changing industry. What I love about this is Tarantino's love for filmmaking, films and the experience of going to the cinema is oozing in this. You can just tell he LOVES what he does and he LOVES going to the movies. The \"quirky\" kind of tone, the witty, fantastic dialogue is all still there and it is top tier Tarantino. The performances from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are incredible, such great chemistry, they elevate the film in every scene they are together, Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate beautifully. And she did a great job respectfully portraying an actress who was murdered tragically. My biggest gripe with the film is that Tarantino didn't use any of his signature high tension, downright uncomfortable sequences regarding the Manson cult. I would've liked to experiences that eeriness when he introduced us to the cult in the film, but he just brushed it off. Other than that the film is incredible artistic, stylized; the soundtrack is amazing, it works incredible well while cliff booth is driving around the night time in LA. It sets the mood perfectly. This is also gonna be one of, if not THE most rewatchable film Tarantino has ever made. Just great. I loved it so much, and I suspect I'll love it even more as time goes on. It's incredible Tarantino made a film with almost no structured narrative and you still come out of it thinking \"that was fantastic\" ; the last shot of the film is so beautiful, and kind of sad if you read up on the Sharon Tate murder. I loved Tarantino's twist to what happened, it made me wish that only if that had what happened in real life :(", "Tarantino Does It Again (No Surprise There)": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood Review:Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is the ninth film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It follows a faded television actor, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as they strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry during the final years of Hollywood's Golden Age in 1969 Los Angeles. Throughout the film we see three different stories with Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate and how the film industry has treated them. All you need is the name Quentin Tarantino to make literally anyone excited for this film. I haven't seen all of his films but from every one I saw there hasn't been one that was just mediocre or even just fine. He does something special with his writing and directing. It all feels so real and believable. The scenes suck the audience in and all the sudden we're living in whatever setting he has created. In this case L.A. 1969. Along with the setting it feels like we know the characters as well. Yes, there are some familiar names like Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski, and Charles Manson, but even with the fictional characters they feel real. There wasn't a single bad performance in this film. I'm not saying this was bad or anything but there was narration at the beginning of the film, and then it just stopped until the very end. It either needed to be throughout the duration of the film or just not at all. I did enjoy the narration but it felt out of place. Anyway, DiCaprio portrays a faded TV star coping with alcohol very well. The comedy mixed with the tragedy of it all is just so entertaining to watch. Brad Pitt's character is so laid back and doesn't care that no one knows who he is. He's also just a clever badass and it really shows during the climax. Cliff and Rick are always together and their bond was so strong. I loved seeing them together and it was probably my favorite aspect of the film. Cliff also has a dog and I just loved his relationship with the dog and how similar the two were. For some reason I really liked the Sharon Tate side story. The Manson murders have interested me and everyone knows about Sharon Tate, but the Hollywood side of the story for her just was enjoyable to watch. First of all, Margot Robbie is such a great actress and I thought she did very well portraying Sharon Tate. She was just a lovable character. There's a scene where she's watching herself in the movies and I loved it. The expressions on her face while watching herself just put a smile on my face. Also they used actually footage which I thought was a good idea. Speaking of the old film footage this actually looked and felt like a 60s classic film. The cinematography had that old, grainy look to it. It just looked good in general capturing the tone. The music choices brought a nostalgic feel to it, even though I wasn't born back enough to be alive around then, also making it feel more like the 60s. Tarantino has a way of making serious moments comedic and just blending in comedy very well. The tone just always feels right. The climax has an array of emotions all happening quickly and there's not much time to process, but the tone felt perfect. That was by far the best 15 minutes of the film. I will say some of it dragged on a little at parts. Some shots were longer than they needed to be and a few things could've been cut out. All of his films are long so it was expected. The production design was very good as well. It's harder to make films in a different time period, especially when there's many settings that have to be used throughout the duration of it. Overall I thought this was a pretty good film. The crowd felt right for it and made for an enjoyable time. It will definitely be a contender for this upcoming award season so I would highly recommend seeing it. Not just for it being a contender but it's also a good film.My Grade: A-", "A self indulgent steaming pile": "It started with nothing and went nowhere, touched on all sorts of random tidbits and did nothing at all with any of them. Huge waste of time.", "Fans of the 60s, McQueen (especially the character Hilts from The Great Escape), Mohammed Ali, Spaghetti Westerns, Corbucci n Zapata moustache will definitely love this.": "I saw this with my family in a theater.\nMy teenage son liked the film too as i had explained him about the 60s n everything related to this film.\nAs a fan of McQueen n Ali, Ioved this even more.The film is about an aging television actor (Caprio) and his stunt double friend (Pitt) n how both r looking for work. While the actor manages to land roles in Spaghetti Westerns, the stunt double is finding it hard to find work due to rumors that he killed his wife.The best part is the ending n Tarantino shud be applauded for the change.\nIt is brutal with solid face smashing, dog mayhem, etc.The scene where the stuntman (Pitt) goes visiting the Charles Mansion's ranch is creepy n it has a downright sinister vibe.Fans of Bruce Lee may be angry but trust me this film ain't racist at all. Myself a big fan of martial arts films n a fan of Lee too.\nMost comedy films may sound racist if v start becoming cynical.\nIt is jus a comical take n not at all offensive.", "\"Inglorious Basterds\" set in Hollywood, California, 1969.": "Wow! Quentin Tarantino is back in full form with this exceptionally well directed and well written revenge fantasy film set in Hollywood of 1969! Tarantino knows how to do dialogue, mood and tension. I wasn't expecting this to be a revenge fantasy film, which steered clear of depticing the horrific real life Manson family murders of actress Sharon Tate and two house guests. A must see for all Quentin Tarantino admirers, of which I am one.", "A different film to what I was expecting !!!!": "I am not a Tarantino fan. I'm gonna let that be known straight out of the gate because that might come as a surprise to some people, especially considering the feelings and overall thoughts I have about this film. Now don't get me wrong even though I'm not particularly a great fan of his previous films........(I just think some of them are bit overrated, none of them are bad, just don't resonate with me as much)........I can still accept the man's talent as a director and why people are anticipating this film some much.Now I'm a little surprised that I'm about say this but........I really really liked this film a lot, I would go as far to say that this is my personal favourite of Quentin Tarantino's filmography so far. The main reason being that this film is completely different as to what I was expecting......if anything it completely obliterated my expectations in all the right ways.Do I really have to comment on the directing in this film....probably not.......but just to remind everyone that yes Quentin Tarantino does still know how to direct a fantastic looking film. End of conversation !The main positives and best parts of the film for me were the story and character relationship of the two main leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt who play \"Rick Dalton\" and \"Cliff Booth\" respectively. Their personal story/relationship is the heart of the film as we follow an actor and his stuntman through the film landscape of Hollywood. Of course its acted to perfection, their two of the greatest actors to have ever lived, you can tell that DiCaprio and Pitt really get along their chemistry is off the charts. Oh also massive shoutout to Pitt's dog in the film, hilarious especially in the end.Now here is a surprising thing I don't think that anyone else in the film is as good as DiCaprio or Pitt from an acting standout. Don't get me wrong everyone else is good in their respective roles however there not at the level of DiCaprio or Pitt. In some films that would be a huge problem but somehow for me it didn't affect the film at all because the two central performances were so good. However Margot Robbie, Kurt Russell, Margret Qualley, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Al Pacino, Mike Moh and Julia Butters are all good in their roles.Now I have no real negatives about the film....maybe its a bit to long......meh maybe....but its nothing major. The only thing I would say is the marketing might a bit misleading or maybe I've mis interpreted what I thought this film was going to focus on. A lot had been made about the fact that the \"Manson Murders' would be in the film, and a lot of that was shown in the trailers for the film. Surprisingly the Manson/Sharon Tate storyline kind of takes a back seat.......and I'm actually kind of glad it does as well, because its not as interesting a story as Rick and Cliff's is. I think this could be a real problem for some audience members going in thinking the films focus was that story but its really not. It is touched on throughout here and there but it only really appears at the end.The ending to this film is brilliant and is everything you could wish to happen.....its just so good how to tie in the Manson/Sharon Tate storyline......brilliant.Overall its 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10 its a really good film from a director that I'm not a fan of at all, so to someone who absolutely adores his films this should be a good indicator that this film is pretty good. A different film then I was expecting but for all the right reasons. DiCaprio and Pitt stupendously good, fantastic journey they go on culminating in one of the funniest endings that I've seen in a while...its truly deserved at well worth the wait. Can't wait to watch it again !", "Overhyped and underwhelming - and I usually love Tarrantino Filems": "While I generally love Tarantino films, \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" left me cold. I was expecting something great. Instead he gives us a bit of a mess filled with forced 1960s references, really forced, unlike \"American Graffiti\" which just melded them into the fabric of the film. Even the afterscene was forced and certainly not worth waiting for.Yes the acting was generally pretty darned good. Yes, the camera work was dazzling. But the film just seemed superficial and artificial.I realize there are plenty of folks who just adored the film and concluded it was innovative and clever beyond belief. I fear those conclusions are as superficial as this film.So if you're a fan of Tarrantino films, this could go either way for you. If you don't buy into the hype, you very well may enjoy it. But iIf you're not a fan of his films, this one isn't likely to turn you into a fan. Better you should rent \"Reservoir Dogs.\"", "DIRECTOR AND STARS SCALE NEW HEIGHTS": "A few years back, Tarantino had a clever idea in the form of a \"what if?\" question: What if there had been a ruthlessly aggressive bunch of Jewish soldiers who had successfully combatted the evil Nazis in Europe during WW2? Somehow, I felt the whole thing was crude and insensitive in a way. But here we have this clever idea (what if the evil hippies who murdered the guests at Polanski's house in 1969 had wandered into a different house and instead met a grisly fate of their own?) used much more successfully. Why? Because the preceding 2 hours locates us in Hollywood, where the streets are paved with fantasies. Though this vastly entertaining movie is masterfully done, and the stars show us why they deserve to be just that, this movie most likely will disappoint those who are not too familiar with the awful events we seem sure are going to be depicted at the end. The final 20 minutes give us a very unexpected bloodbath, with the bonus of an equally unexpected happy ending. Neat trick, and it could only happen at the movies. Can anything top this for the year's best movie? Not bloody likely, I'd say.", "Once upon a time....in Hollywood": "Oh ya, come on Quentin Tarantino is the Master at FILM Making. Come on who else cans make a Film like this MAN. He Makes Films that stay in your Brains FOREVER.\nTHE BEST PART IS NOBODY CAN REMAKE HIS FILM'S BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CRAZY LIKE HE IS.\nHE IS THE FILM MANIAC, CRAZY ANIMAL LOL.\nLOVE ALL HIS WORK EVEN HIS CREEPY ACTING.\nTHERE IS NO OTHER Quentin Tarantino in the FILM Industry and he should be HAPPY ABOUT IT.", "Hey! You're Quentin freaking Tarantino, don't you forget it!": "Wow. Where to begin. OK. I will respect QT's wishes, walk the line and not include a single spoiler here. Call it reciprocity for the respect he has shown me as an audience member. A deeply satisfied one at that. So glad I caught this in a theater, which is how a QT film should be watched, i.e. on a brodingnagian-sized screen. I remember QT's first few films. How they were informed but not overwhelmed by other filmmaker's ideas. He'd borrow a piece from this one and that one, etc. Back then he was building well-crafted dollhouses rather than motion pictures. The passion and enthusiasm were always there. You sensed his love for film, it was/is palpable and infectious. Then he found his voice, maybe found is the wrong word, cultivated a unique voice and perspective through hard work. Evident first in his writing, then in his directing. Once he found that equipoise of both, he became a force of nature. For me, this started with Django Unchained. A really exceptional and visceral piece of storytelling in the great American tradition. It continued with Hateful Eight, flaws and all. And now we have the realization and culmination of all the man's talent overflowing in wild abundance. What QT does with this latest film of his is set a new standard not just for 21st Century filmmaking, but also screenwriting. It isn't too hard to believe that he first considered Once Upon... as a novel, not a film. I'm glad he disabused himself of that initial impulse. This film is his magnum opus. A lyrical love letter not just to L.A., but also to his audience. It is clear he respects our intelligence. This film he has gifted us with is full of smart choices, artful direction, unexpected twists, and stunning surprises. You will find allusions, both obvious and oblique, to many of his other films. There's a plethora of cool references. Dazzling landmarks and haunts, resplendent in their past glory despite the smog. A sixth sense of the '69 zeitgeist. Monumental moments of well-timed, gale-force laughter inducing punchlines which serve to leaven the heavier stuff. There's also plenty of sincerity and emotional honesty abounding here. I'd say all of the actors, primary, secondary, ancillary, tertiary and even the four-legged ones all brought their A-games, just like QT. It is Leo's finest performance since Gilbert Grape. Brad's best since Kalifornia. The chemistry between the two is Siamese symbiosis at its most inspiring. Al Pacino kills it as Schwarzs. Margot Robbie was the right choice to play the angelically pulchritudinous Sharon Tate. She's like a light source. Especial shout-outs as well to Damian Lewis who becomes Steve McQueen. Scoot McNairy, brilliant as always, as Business Bob Gilbert. Julia Butters, the child actress that steals the scene that she's in with Leo. I could keep going but I'd risk sounding sycophantic. Just go and see it. This was the first film that gave me Stendhal symptoms since the Witch. I can't get it out of my head. Sincere gratitude, Q.T., for a truly immersive filmic experience. You made me a participant in the era, the scene. You are very generous with your talents. The great film poet Jodorowsky once said, \"Too much perfection is a mistake.\" Not this time.", "Once upon a time in Hollywood": "Once upon a time in Hollywood is a masterpiece unlike any other masterpiece. The way the movie was filmed was perfection. The acting was on point. It was just a fantastic movie.", "I think I have a new favorite Tarantino movie": "As someone who likes but has never really loved Tarantino's style, I was blown away by this movie. It's more than a nostalgic trip back to 1960s Hollywood; it's a weird statement on movies and escapism themselves. It is every bit the fairy tale the title ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD implies, with its second chances and bizarre happy ending, though even these are tempered with little reminders of painful realities.Those looking for hard plot will be disappointed. This is a very laid back movie, just following the daily lives of a handful of characters in 1969 LA. Cinephiles and those fond of the 1960s will likely get the most out of it-- if you walk in not having some familiarity with the Tate murders or the Manson family, you might get a bit lost.The lack of plot hardly matters, as the characters are fun to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are both hilarious and touching in their roles. Margot Robbie was a fabulous Sharon Tate and I'm honestly a bit bummed her role wasn't larger. That scene with her in the movie theater was just classic.The long run-time initially daunted me-- part of my problem with so many mainstream Hollywood movies these days is that they're often too long (especially superhero movies), but the three hours here flew right by. I was enjoying myself so much that I was loathe to leave these characters once the credits rolled at last.", "An awesome look at Hollywood in 1969": "Set in Hollywood in 1969, once great star Rick Dalton(Leonardo DiCaprio) feels he is now has been, cause good roles are not coming his way, stuck doing minor roles in TV shows, his comfort is his stunt double and good friend Cliff Booth(Brad Pitt), who sticks by him through out, but in Hollywood not everything is all glamour.\nQuentin Tarantino has done it again, with his incredible directing and storytelling, and the way he makes the scenery of 1969 become a character itself. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Redford really have a good Paul Newman and Robert Redford like chemistry to there characters, you instantly buy there history and friendship. Margot Robbie does shine as Sharon Tate, even though she has little bit to do, she comes through when she comes on screen. If you are expecting this film to be accurate of how certain events took place in that decade, you gotta to know that Tarantino likes to play fast and loose with that, and I'm glad cause it kept me on the edge of my seat. Nicohlas Hammond(The Sound of Music, Spider-Man) does chew up the scenery in a cameo has director Sam Wannamaker. R.I.P. Luke Perry who also makes a cameo. My only complaint is there a sub plot about Brad Pitts character, that never really gets answered, maybe that was the point, but that is minor. I still liked it, it's a great homage to Hollywood in 1969.", "Proably Tarantino's masterpiece": "It was inevitable that, sooner or later, QT would get around to a film focusing entirely on the film-making process and the town he loves so well. The only question was, when? Well, at last he's done it, one film away from what he says will be his final film and as the title attests \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" is set in the past but again, typical of its director, he sets it at a very specific time, 1969, and around a very specific event. the murder of Sharon Tate and four of her friends by the Manson Family, and this just might be his masterpieceKnowing the subject in advance, of course, might lead us to suppose that Tarantino could still go down the road of earlier pictures like \"Django Unchained\" and \"Inglorious Basterds\", brilliant but mostly tasteless and jokey explorations of violence like an A-Movie version of a B-Movie aesthetic...but he doesn't. This is a love-letter to Hollywood, to the movies and to actors. Yes, the final half hour or so is dark and deeply disturbing, (yet it's also Tarantino funny and black as hell), and it might be too dark for the Academy but the rest is glorious; highly intelligent talk and often, (surprise, surprise), very moving.There are three main characters, two fictitious and one real. The fictitious characters are actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double, Cliff Booth; the real character is Sharon Tate who, with her husband Roman Polanski, happens to be Dalton's next door neighbour. The film covers a period of three days, two in February and one in August. Dalton is an actor past his sell-by date, reduced to playing villains on TV and advised, (by a magnificent Al Pacino), to go to Italy and play the hero in Italian westerns. His stunt double and best friend has also seen better days. They are played superbly by a hardly ever better Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Indeed I think DiCaprio has only topped this performance once before when he played Jordan Belfort in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\".It's a film full of set-pieces and both DiCaprio and Pitt have their fair share; Leonardo most memorably in one of those television westerns where is acting is Emmy-worthy until ... (Tarantino even manages to cleverly put him into \"The Great Escape\" in the part actually played by Steve McQueen, very nicely reincarnated here by Damian Lewis), while Pitt has a scene of superb menace at the Manson ranch, one of several scenes where Tarantino pulls the rug out from under us with a punch-line that isn't what you were expectingElsewhere, the real-life Sharon Tate, (a terrific Margot Robbie), is enjoying the fruits of her celebrity and also gets her set-piece when she visits a cinema showing \"The Wrecking Crew\", relishing her performance up on the screen. While hardly a downer on the film in general I did think Tarantino treated Miss Tate rather cruelly. Was she really this much of an air-head? Surely not or is he suggesting she only made it through the casting couch? Someone else he takes down a peg or three is Bruce Lee, (an excellent Mike Moh), in a very funny scene with Brad Pitt. In fact, his treatment of Lee has already lead to a few complaints from his friends and family. To that, all I can say is 'it's only a film'. And it's a great film. At two hours and forty minutes it isn't overlong even if the heart of darkness he finally uncovers did leave me feeling a little queasy. It's also full of great supporting performances and it blends fact and fiction seamlessly. His masterpiece? Probably..", "A Magnificent Masterpiece": "Quentin Tarantino's latest film, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, is truly my favorite film of the year and next to Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, it is one of Tarantino's greatest gems ever.This film takes place in 1969 in Hollywood, and features Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo Dicaprio), his stunt double Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt), and the beautiful Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie) make their way around an industry that is slowly disintegrating and changing. The film has different storylines and plays tribute to the golden ages to Hollywood's last amazing moments.This film was truly astounding. The three stars did a great job. Dicaprio was top notch with his performance, Pitt was tough and wild, and Robbie was wonderfully amazing. Other actors, like Al Pacino and Dakota Fanning and the rest of the great cast did a great job as well.The film may be 2 hours and 45 mins, but it keeps you very entertained all the way. The fist two hours is basically a tribute to good ol' Hollywood, and the last 45 mins is truly epic and is where things take a turn for the greatest.One last thing, this film proves this film can be truly original. The concept is very tremendous and was an interesting idea for a film.Bottom line, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood was a very great film that I HIGHLY recommend to many people that are a fan of the three stars, that are a fan of Tarantino's films, and that are a fan of classic Hollywood times.", "8.8 of 10.

I'm not a part of my generation that worships Charles Manson and thinks he really had anything interesting or relevant to say. In fact, I've compared him to advertising consultants and TED talk speakers, two groups that I find as abhorent as the man who ordered the murder of everyone in the house where Sharon Tate lived and believed that the \"White Album\" was to be the start of a race war that his Family alone would survive. I didn't want a Tarantino film all about Manson. And good news. This movie is anything but. Instead, it's a love letter to the end of the studio system as Hollywood moves from dashing square jawed leading men to neurotic antiheroes for a few years before blockbusters would change the game all over again.My worries about the Manson Family in this film were unfounded. Sharon Tate exists as an angel here, above and beyond the cares of the characters that somehow live in the same world as her. She dances alone, not only at the Playboy Mansion but throughout the reality this film has stitched together. She's as much of an ideal and McGuffin as Pulp Fiction's briefcase. Her mention of what a great actor Rick was is enough to make him forget that he just stared death down and might have almost lost the only person in the world who truly loves him, no matter what.Near pefection. Amen.", "Another great Tarantino flick": "First of all, I could not believe the movie was over when the credits came up. A 2 1/2 hour movie that seemed much, much shorter.

It was just a beautifully crafted movie.", "Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!": "The title is just that, lot's s stories. You wonder how much is real and how much is fiction. No spoilers here but let me say this; I was surprised how fast 2 hours and 45 minutes goes by when the movie is edited perfectly!", "Tarantino Rewrites History ... Again": "In his ninth film noticeably lacking in the usual Tarantino shtick (thank God there was no Mexican stand-off!), he has produced perhaps his most intelligent film. The young and the old is a major theme that plays out throughout the film. Old Hollywood vs New Hollywood. 1969 was a year of deep change in Hollywood. Hollywood suddenly discovering that a young audience existed that did not want to see movies with middle-aged and older stars, and was struggling to urge that audience to see their movies. This is where Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) finds himself, an \"old\" as in 1950's, star, attempting to find a new image and shake the inescapable conviction that he is a has-been. There is a reason why one of the songs from that era, The Rolling Stones, \"Out of Time,\" is in the movie soundtrack. Both Rick and the Old Hollywood are \"out of time.\"The subtext that lies underneath throughout the movie is Sharon Tate, Charlie Manson, his Family, and Sharon's Tate's entourage. Not only is Sharon Tate a neighbor but he and his stunt man, played by Brad Pitt, continually encounter Manson and his group throughout the movie. The New Hollywood lost its innocence with the Tate-LaBianca murders. There is no innocence in Rick Dalton's life, though. He's on the downslide and he knows it.Just as Inglorious Basterds re-wrote the history of the Second World War, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood re-writes the fate of Sharon Tate and the other people on Cielo Drive that night. The title is very appropriate. This really is a fairy tale, this is not how the actual events occurred, but the way we would have liked the story to end. At the same time, this is a snap-shot of a specific time and a specific place which is stone-cold reality and spot on. Tarantino has done such a good job in showing the changing face of Hollywood that the movie can be considered to be a time capsule. If you were there you will relish the past coming back to life again; if you weren't this is the best way to depict how it was without using a Time Machine to take you back.", "Only Tarantino could come up with this....": "I believe the actors had a bunch of fun with this, they were fully vested, even the extras did this film proud. You will be entertained throughout but some may think where is this going....it gets there.I am very impressed with the realism in the settings, and props, even though a bit surrealistic in the film, and TV spots I believe that was for a younger crowd.

Do go out and see it before you hear too much about it, and some of its surprises get spoiled. I don't think it spoils anything to disclose that tragic real-world events get a benign, even semi-sweet revision. Sort of like what-if-someone-had-capped-Hitler-in-1930. As someone who disdained television in those days, many of the television references are lost on me. But as a car guy, I find the depth of the period car lineup breathtaking.", "Once Upon a Career...": "Ahh Mr. Tarantino, you have done it again.

Like all Tarantino films, this one too definitely requires a second watch, just to catch the dialogue and appreciate the characters.

Ignore the poor reviews they obviously just don't connect with it. This is a gem.", "A World I Would Live In": "One of the best compliments a director can receive is that I wish their film was longer. That's not to say that OUATIH isn't very long, as it certainly is for today's standards, but I truly could have lived in this world for another hour or two. Quentin Tarantino's brilliant sense for world building without ever having to do a sequel (aside from Kill Bill, which he still contends is one story anyway) is extremely impressive. He loves to take his sweet time with monologue after monologue and countless amounts of long shots that a normal filmmaker would cut down significantly, but I ate all of it up.Oh, and we've never had a DiCaprio/Pitt team-up before? That counts for a lot too. Their chemistry makes the movie fly by, and pulls on your heart up until the bitter end. This isn't a story about the Manson murders, rather a story about friendship and the idea of old hollywood meeting new hollywood. The 50's, 60's, and even into the 70's were considered a thriving time for filmmaking and Tarantino clearly has a huge affinity to this era, and of course, Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie). Sure, maybe she doesn't have a ton of dialogue, but her presence is felt throughout every scene with DiCaprio as the 'new age' seeps into his career and forces him to make drastic changes to his path.A slow burn for most of the film turns into a hectic and absolutely insane final act, one which is already dividing audiences, but creating conversation is exactly what Tarantino sets out to do. He better not retire after his 10th film.....Special shoutout to Margaret Qualley, this is a star making turn from her.9.4/10", "Tarantino The Storyteller Strikes Gold": "Quentin Tarantino is known for his love of pop culture. In \"Once Upon a Time,,,\" he so captures the zeitgeist of an era through an abundance of details that I can recommend the film for that reason alone. The music of the time is the backdrop to this fairy tale based (in part) on fact.Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an actor with more misses than hits. He is awash in self-doubt and conscious of his place in Hollywood's pecking order. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is Dalton's best friend and stunt double, happy to live in Dalton's shadow, but more self-confident than his buddy. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is an actress on the verge of film stardom and wife of Roman Polanski. We follow these three characters through their daily activities, discovering their joys and their disappointments, their challenges and their successes. It's a mash-up of fact and fiction that is compelling to watch, especially if one is aware of the real events of 1969.The cast is studded with surprises and some hidden gems that are only revealed when reviewing the list of credits after the fact.There are two performances I wish to highlight. Margaret Qualley (daughter of Andie McDowell) plays Pussycat with an energy that lights up the screen. I last saw her portray Ann Reinking in Fosse/Verdon---a role she was suited for, but it lacked the brilliance she is permitted to reveal as Pussycat. Also, Julia Butters plays Trudi, a precocious 8-year-old who commands your attention as she acts opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.Tarantino's imprint is all over this film, stylistically and thematically. There is a real joy in watching him spin this yarn, leading the viewer to a denouement that can only be staggering, whichever path it takes.", "An Honest Review": "OK, I'm giving it 10 stars, not because it's a great film and not because it's one of QT's best films... but because compared to everything else out there today it is a Masterpiece.However, unfortunately, anyone that has seen all of QT's films, the ending is spoiled from the start purely on the basis that we understand how he treats history.And, unfortunately, for SOME people it is a very slow burner, but one with absolutely fantastic acting and directing. It's a slow burner that is a brilliant period piece, and it is a slow burner that is almost a love letter to classic Hollywood, so though it takes nearly forever for any real pay off, its a fine film to actually watch and one that maintains a quality of entertainment and leaves little clues peppered throughout of the coming payoff.And the clues are important as they are, essentially, little promises that the film is making for the finale.The finally, however is so ultra-violent, so over-the-top that it's absolutely hysterical.It's not his best film, but its certainly loyal to his others, gone however is the quick witted and quotable dialogue that marked his earlier films, but it is traded off for a sleek professionalism of a seasoned director.", "Superb!": "Superb! Most moviegoers want the mindless crap horrible plot action star junk. Superb acting, Direction, cinematography, writing and SET DESIGNS! Amazing genre. Artistic perfection! Authenticity! Seamless! Great tribute to the time and genres of the time! Classic Tarantino artistic creative and writing license. Ignore the uncultured swine that cannot evolve or appreciate an artists risks growth and evolution", "Masterpiece": "Tarantino's masterpiece and the best movie of 2019 way better than parasite.", "Wow what a movie. QT Movie is not for everyone": "What a hell of a movie, I loved the whole movie, specially the last scene. Wow Thank You So Much QT for doing this movie. Brad Pitt is 10 on 10, DiCaprio is also good here. Wow a Must Watch!", "Cool TV nostalgia and late 60s neo-noir sabotaged (once again) by master of adolescent revenge fantasy": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's tribute to the glory days of 50s TV replete with reconstructions of old TV westerns and their attendant commercials. Tarantino's main \"present day\" story is set in the heady days of 1969 and strictly neo-noir in tone.\nThe protagonist here is Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), the former star of a successful 50s TV series, \"Bounty Law,\" whose career has taken a nose dive, now playing the villain on various contemporary television shows. His sidekick is Cliff Booth (an impressive Brad Pitt), an Army vet, who has been working for him in the capacity of stunt double as well as driver and handyman for about a decade.\nThe film begins with Dalton meeting with Schwarz (Al Pacino), Dalton's agent who provides a dire analysis of his career prospects and suggests that he take on work in Italy, acting in spaghetti westerns, which could be quite profitable. Dalton balks at the prospect of working as part of such cheesy enterprises and initially declines to travel to Italy. The scene is long-winded despite providing a great cameo for Pacino.\nDespite its slow pace, \"Hollywood\" has a palpable sense of dread to it as the principals Dalton and Booth have rented a house right next to the infamous residence where Sharon Tate and her friends were murdered by the Manson gang. For a while, it actually feels like the fictional characters of Dalton and Booth could have been there, crossing paths with the real-life Manson and his crazy crew of murdering sycophants.\nThere's also a flashback as Booth reminiscences about a physical confrontation he got into with Bruce Lee years earlier on the set of the film The Green Hornet. It's another one of Tarantino's self-indulgent scenes which is supposed to foreshadow Booth's physical prowess. It's unfair to Lee, who is depicted as a macho bully, who purportedly wasn't as cocky and arrogant as that in real life.\nTarantino shines in his scene where Booth picks up a member of the Manson gang while hitchhiking and gives her a ride back to the Spahn Movie Ranch, where Manson's followers are holed up. Booth remembers George Spahn from his work as a stunt double at the ranch years before and wants to check on him. He's menaced by the Manson miscreants, especially Squeaky Fromme, and soon beats up Grogan, an unsavory hippie who first slashes Booth's tire. Tarantino's dialogue is particularly good here, with the Manson crew appearing quite scary and believable.\nMeanwhile, more real-life personages are introduced by Tarantino, including the doomed Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), who's seen taking in her own flick (The Wrecking Crew) at a local movie theater. How much this contributes to the overall story is debatable-I understand it's supposed to add to the atmosphere of the times, but the Tate part again doesn't seem well integrated into the plot.\nLess successful is another long-winded sequence involving Dalton who is hired to play the heavy on a new western series, \"Lancer.\" DiCaprio is actually quite good depicting Dalton as having a nervous breakdown on the set after forgetting his lines and then returning to give a powerful performance, impressing the series director. It's only less successful because it again just goes on for too long and needs more editing. But Tarantino can't help himself, as he loves the old TV shows, and doesn't understand that his audience might not appreciate his long-winded homages, as much as he does.\nPrior to the climax, Dalton's agent convinces him to finally take on some work in Italy, where he's hired to do a few spaghetti westerns, ends up getting married and splits with Booth. All this is rather unconvincingly related by a narrator who sums up the action in a series of voice overs.\nThat bring us to the unfortunate denouement where once again Tarantino shows his inevitable true colors. Dalton and Booth decide to have one last drunken bender where they end up inebriated back at Dalton's house. The crazed Manson killers end up at Dalton's home where (in an alternate history), Booth and Dalton dispatch them in salacious ways (Booth ends up wounded, with a knife stuck in his leg) and Dalton uses a blowtorch (which he still happens to possess from one of his World War II pictures) to set Susan Atkins, one of the more notable of Manson's crazed followers, on fire in the backyard swimming pool.\nAn appropriate reaction to all this should be, \"Oy vey.\" Once again, Tarantino invokes his unconscious cinematic mantra which is of course, let's have another puerile, adolescent revenge fantasy. Whether it be Nazis (\"Inglorious Basterds\"), racist slaveholders (\"Django Unchained\") or now hippies and the Manson Family, Tarantino takes the easy way out by shooting down a group of straw men that people just love to hate.\nWhy does Tarantino sabotage his movies with revenge fantasy? Deep down this is the way Tarantino can garner acceptance in the film critics' community. By dreaming up alternate historical scenarios (such as killing Hitler), it allows his audience to avoid the painful truth of reality: that the good guys don't always win and there is actual tragedy in the world where innocent people are killed (like Sharon Tate).\nDon't count on Tarantino to ever dispense with his deceptive and morally bankrupt strategies. Despite his talents (and he has many!), \"Hollywood\" will remain part of Tarantino's standard oeuvre: entertaining exercises in nostalgia that appeal to an adolescent base thirsting for revenge, decidedly incapable of facing reality.", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - 7.8": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - 7.8Act 1 - 7.3Act 2 - 7.6Act 3 - 8.4\nGood:All performances were goodLeo and Pitt were fantastic in this duel lead, great chemistryTarantino retells the story of the Manson Murders to his liking and with his made up charactersDialogue is great per usualFilm is funny and sincereLove how much Tarantino loves cinema, captured the old westerns and over the top action films perfectly in the characters that Rick Dalton playsThe Manson Family ranch scene was great, awesome tension built to a good payoffVery good camera workLoved the characters of Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth who had time to grow and breathe over the course of the filmConclusion of the film is an interesting bait and switch that works to great effect with the Manson Family attacking Rick's home instead of Tate'sLeads to a bloody finale and some very funny moments\nBad:Voiceover was out of place and unnecessary and unexplainedI get why Sharon Tate's story is there but for the story Tarantino was telling, her character was not needed other than for a bait and switch. Could have had her character less developed when she has no real pay offCould have cut out some 20 minutes of the film", "The Most Gentle Of Tarantino": "In his only film with zero N-bombs, Tarantino takes on the town that he grew up against. And though there really isn't much of a plot to speak of, it is an exercise in atmosphere and recreating a bygone era without internet, cell phones, or social media. Instead, creative people bounced around waiting to do things. Especially in the case of Rick Dalton, a washed up Hollywood Western actor who has been relegated to playing villain roles which is the road to being a true washed up actor. Without an actor, listless Cliff Booth...Dalton's stunt double is also without a job.\nNow, you may be really frustrated at where this film goes, because...really, it spins its wheels until a gruesome, yet darkly funny ending emerges. And, truth be told, it's really not that funny either, it becomes Tarantino's next attempt at re-writing history. Does it matter? No...the title tells you it's a fairy tale, but what I got from it, is the sensibility of drifters walking through Hollywood trying to do things without it being anything other than employment. Today's Hollywood is more about being famous than anything.\nAnd that is the charm of this, is that DiCaprio's Dalton isn't wallowing in fame or fortune, it's that he is desperately looking for the next role.\nYes, once you get Tarantino's little gags, such as anticipation for something brutal to occur at the Spahn Ranch where Manson Family live...it becomes a tense humorous release. OR, the constant jokes on absurdist dialogue. Yes, those are transparent Tarantino. BUT, in an odd way, this is ALSO his most casual bounce. A bygone era of...innocence. As if a child told you this story.\nAnd if you can dig that, than you will have a great time.", "A ninth opus distinctly different": "Even if the context and the script are fundamentally different, Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood (2019) is inherently alike Hail, Caesar! (2016) directed by the Coen brothers and lovingly dedicated to the cinematographic world of the 50's and more precisely to the Hollywood gossips. Thus, with his ninth opus, Quentin Tarantino plunges us with delightful and nostalgia into the Hollywood atmosphere of 1969 with two main characters: Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a has-been actor and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is his personal stuntman. And during the first two hours, we bump with pleasure into major figures of the seventh art such as Steve McQueen (I'm an indefectible fan!), Roman Polanski or Bruce Lee. Quentin Tarantino was 6 years old in 1969. This film is an avalanche of cult references of his childhood with implicit or explicit allusions to Wanted: Dead or Alive (1958), The Green Hornet (1966), The Great Escape (1963), Dixie Dynamite (1976), the Western Spaghetti, a well-known subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-60s, ... And the barbaric murder of Sharon Tate is unfortunately a nightmarish Proust's madeleine.For sure, the atmosphere of 1969 is perfectly transcribed with a strong focus on the two fictive fellows, Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth. Thus, Brad Pitt interprets a guy without particular ambition, fulfilled, living from day to day without worrying about tomorrow and endowed with an exceptionally mesmerizing aura; in the audience, women were obviously under his spell. Leonardo DiCaprio impersonates a more complex individual who is no more than the shadow of himself, inexorably sliding towards the abysses of oblivion. They are both awesome! And Margot Robbie? Well, well, well, she sublimely shines. I truly behaved like the Tex Avery's howling wolf in each of her scenes!If you are a film buff, you will probably enjoy Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood (2019). If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino as I am, you may be surprised or even frustrated by the contemplative narration and the deliberately slow pace. Actually, with a recipe including 2 major ingredients such as 1) Sharon Tate in August 1969 and 2) Quentin Tarantino, we may say that the cooking is over a sloooooow heat until the long-awaited final denouement, and the prepared dish is undoubtedly lacking of bloody red chili.PS: There are rumors that Quentin Tarantino will bow out after his tenth opus. It can't be! No way!! I want 10 more masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction (1994) or Reservoir Dogs (1992), during the next three decades, please!", "violence then.. violence now": "Quentin Tarantino known for violence in his movies and one of my favorite directors tried something different and it is awesome. The movie Once upon a Time in... Hollywood is about 3 different times in same year.first day happenings last for almost half hour, second day lasts for more than an hour and then six months later lasts for major part of movie.\nThere is hardly any violence in first 2 hrs of movie and my favorite part of movie is last thirty minutes when Leonardo Dicaprio as Rick Dalton is relaxing in his own gorgeous swimming pool with his headsets on , totally oblivious to violence and killings in his beautiful house where his body double Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth is extremely ruthless in getting rid of hippies who have come to steal. Margot Robbie as next door Sharon Tate is very pleasant. Only in Hollywood... only after all the killings and violence , Rick dalton gets to meet a famous director who is his next door neighbor. Last half hour proved that Quentin Tarantano loves stylish violence. Good movie.", "Tarantino returns to form": "This movie marks a significant return to form for Quentin Tarantino with what is probably his most confident and best film. It also contains two of the best performances from Di Caprio and Pitt who make a great double act (surely Pitt must be a favourite for a supporting actor Oscar). The film is always entertaining showing the end of the studio era in sixties Hollywood and the rise of television , providing work for aging stars and B movie actors. There is much to enjoy here including backlot Kung fu fights with Bruce Lee and meeting A lister star Steve McQueen at studio parties plus an accurate recreation of the 'groovy , hippie 'sixties. The atmosphere changes as the film progresses with the introduction of Charles Manson and the underlying menace and threat provided by his drug addicted followers. Great ending and great film!", "Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood was another worthy Quentin Tarantino film": "Anyone who's very familiar with Quentin Tarantino knows he doesn't make conventional movies. So when watching his meandering narrative here, I just sat back and enjoyed his going wherever he feels he needs to go wherever it might lead us. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio play a stunt man and an actor, respectively, in the late '60s in Hollywood who get mixed with some real-life people resulting in an alternate timeline. I'll stop there and just say me and my movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this (though he thought it was pretty weird) and I certainly enjoyed both Tarantino's dialogue and climatic action scenes. Really fascinating to watch to on that note, I recommend Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood.", "Can't satisfy everyone": "Awesome movie. Glad to have watched it on Thursday at the first showing. If you're a Tarantino fan you will love it, if not you'll find something to nitpick. Is it perfect ? No, but it's a perfect film to add to Tarantino's list.

Tarantino delivers his answer to any criticism the twitter mob will heap on him well in advance in the climax of this sprawling beast of a movie. Brad and Leo are phenomenal. Best I've seen this year.", "Great cinema !": "I really loved this movie, it is such an hommage to the American film and it's heroes !\nIt is also such a pity that the way the story goes here didn't happen in reality for Sharon and the other victims of those monsters who committed these horrible crimes.. She was such a beautiful person...For me it is a 10/10 !!", "Tarantino Finally Stopped Trying to be Tarantino": "Make a note while watching Quentin Tarantino's entirely different kind of revenge revisionist-history film...It not only centers around real life counter-culture figures Charles Manson & Family, Sharon Tate (a strutting Barbie Doll here), Roman Polanski and hairstylist Jay Sebring (Tate's supposed lover) but the last of The Family's victims, Donald \"Shorty\" Shea, an experienced tough-guy stuntman who thought the hippie horde was taking advantage of employer George Spahn at his formerly active Spahn Movie Ranch, where Manson and company made their very own playground, ultimately setting stage for the \"Helter Skelter Murders\" that infamously included an 8-month pregnant Tate...For people expecting ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD to be the kind of bloody thriller Tarantino's known for, the dark and forbidding suspenseful stuff begins halfway through in a pivotal scene where Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth, a world-weary stunt man like Shea, checks up on old friend/acquaintance Spahn (Bruce Dern adequately replacing Burt Reynolds) to find out what the deal is with the hippie freeloaders...But Pitt plays anything but a victim, built into such an indestructible bad ass he lives in a grungy LETHAL WEAPON style trailer, owns a pitbull and even gets the best of Bruce Lee, who, surprisingly since Tarantino worships Asian Kung Fu flicks, is a pretentious blowhard boob, and not even a decent fighter! Which can feel downright blasphemous from a filmmaker to his core-fans that both worship the legendary icon. But like everything else, it all makes its own bizarre/offbeat sense by the end...Which shouldn't be spoiled except to say that even if you did know \"how\" things go down, the \"why\" is hilariously violent, unique and original despite initially seeming tacked on and rushed (following a sudden six-month lapse). Which might be because spending so much meantime with stunt-double Cliff Booth and the \"has-been\" actor he doubles for, runs errands for, and hangs out with, is the best thing going in a film where Tarantino hasn't seemed as loose and relaxed with since KILL BILL...Perhaps it's because the usual endless string of pop culture references don't feel so contrived since the movie takes place where most of them originated. And in that, 1969 Los Angeles comes to life in predictably nostalgic, groovy grandeur. But with all the prolonged (and sometimes overlong) existential driving around town and hanging around movie sets, it's really more about characters than the time period they exist in. That alone puts HOLLYWOOD miles past INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED and THE HATEFUL EIGHT, which all overdosed on their own genre-driven style over substance...For this is a much simpler tale, and a buddy flick to boot. Tarantino even compared his handsome duo to Robert Redford and Paul Newman... and yet, these particular buddies are hardly together at all. While Booth takes his aforementioned stroll through the bad-vibey Spahn Ranch (ironically staged like a HIGH NOON type showdown), faded star Rick Dalton makes the best of making the transition from playing the hero on his own bygone Cowboy TV series to becoming typecast (warned by an Al Pacino cameo) as a villain in everyone else's: Giving Leonardo DiCaprio a chance to truly enjoy himself in a Tarantino role...And what really works about Leo's Dalton is that he's... well... an actor, and in that, somewhat of a pussy. Unlike his macho double, he only wins or loses fights based on whatever script he's working really hard trying to be convincing in. Providing a comfortably suited, down-to-earth niche for the A-list DiCaprio, who often chooses roles far too big for his britches. In other words, he doesn't seem to be striving for an Oscar, or trying to become the next Anthony Hopkins (many leading men want to be character-actors, but very few are both at the same time)...As for fellow Oscar-winning success story, Quentin Tarantino, his directorial presence is surely felt, especially with the random flashbacks and expository filler to remind the audience why this and that is important right now as it's happening, again... plus the fact no one else would make such a deliberately pulsating jukebox of a film about films...But there's also a feeling he's holding just-enough back so to, for the first time in decades, let his characters fill in the more subtle yet detailed moments that make RESERVOIR DOGS, PULP FICTION and especially JACKIE BROWN so fun to watch, again and again...In striving for a perfectly good ride, Tarantino's ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD doesn't suffer from trying too-hard for epic greatness...Sometimes pretty good can turn out pretty great.", "Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction": "First of all I'll just say, what a ride. The first viewing it really is a lot to take in, but the second viewing I knew what I was in for and it was even better paying attention to all of the little details. I'm 24 and actually had no idea about Sharon Tate (I had heard of her, I just didn't know what happened to her). So I feel this almost made the experience better for me the first time because I had very little expectations as to what may happen.I disagree with some people saying that younger generations won't enjoy it because it's set in the late 60's. Really, if you know the basics of what was going on at that time and are a Tarantino fan and/or a film lover, you should definitely enjoy this movie. Also, people saying it doesn't have a plot are missing the point. It's meant to be a fantasy and homage to that time period in and around Hollywood. It actually does have multiple plots, they are just hard to recognize because they are hidden behind many of Tarantino's little quirks. Essentially, it's about an actor hitting a speed bump in his career and not knowing what's next for him. And also his stunt double and confidant who inadvertently gets involved with the Manson \"family\". All while living next door to Sharon Tate.Really, everything is damn near perfect; namely the acting, writing and cinematography. The music, as always with Tarantino, was excellent. It is perhaps one of Tarantino's funniest movies too. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are both brilliant. I'm still having a difficult time deciding who was better. Probably Leo in terms of his intense acting, but Brad was as cool as ever and probably the more memorable character. Margot Robbie does an excellent job of portraying Sharon Tate and her innocence as well. Tarantino gets the very best out of all the supporting actors. Every single actor, whether in a minor role or not, definitely brought their A-game.Even if you feel like you wouldn't like the movie, I still think it's one that everyone should go and see anyway. If you don't like it, then that's fine. I just feel it brings you back to a time and place that we can all kind of relate to and appreciate in one way or another. Of course many people will be put off by its length and for being \"slow\" and self-indulgent. But for being the film it is, I feel those are almost positives because of the way Tarantino presents it. Definitely don't expect a bunch of action and violence like most of his films. The ending (which is amazing) and a few other moments aside, it's really one of his least violent movies. Also, it is maybe one his most mature films, perhaps right after Jackie Brown. Overall, it sort of has a little bit of all of his previous work bunched into it, which is probably another reason I loved it so much. It doesn't quite surpass \"Pulp Fiction\" for me, but it may just be the closest Tarantino gets to doing so.", "A film about mutual respect": "Rick and Cliff are friends. They are always nice to each other. They don't argue, patronize or resent each other. When we see them separately, they handle themselves well, dignified. When together, there is a tenderness that is best shown as being supportive.This, for me is the ingredient that gives the end of the film such an uplift. Many watchers of this film have commented how they stuck with it and were rewarded by the last quarter. That could lead you to conclude that it's the final scenes that evoke the uplifting feeling I mentioned, which would be quite reductive and perverse, wouldn't it?So it's about the beautiful friendship and how nice it is to see two people interact with each other in that unassuming, largely unspoken way.", "Greatness as always": "This movie has two great leads who perform masterfully. The flow and feel of the movie is also great. One of the best movies so far this year and an ending that was very unpredictable. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood go see it it's worth it.", "Tarantino = Awesomeness": "The first hint that Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is a more wistful film than it may appear is in its title. Starting with the magic words that mark the opening of a fairy tale, followed by the bridge of a pensive ellipsis, the title evokes the empty, bone-deep ache that underlies all nostalgia, a longing for a half-remembered moment in time that may never have really existed at all. If any contemporary film director's work stands up to such a granular reading, it's Quentin Tarantino's; in this film, as in all his others, he breaks down a place and time-in this case, Hollywood, 1969- and rebuilds it in his own movie-obsessed image, each deliberately placed poster and casually dropped reference one piece of a cryptic puzzle. Here, however, the writer-director's own yearnings and anxieties are closer to the surface than usual.This is Tarantino's most personal film in decades, and the longings expressed in it flow from who he is as a person: an established middle-aged white guy confronting his own impending irrelevance. That exact prospect eats away at the film's protagonist, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fading Western TV star whose diminishing celebrity has forced him to contemplate the unthinkable for an actor of his caliber: going to Rome to star in \"Eye-talian\" Westerns. Rick still lives the lifestyle of a man in his 20s, but now those blotto nights alone in his Hollywood bachelor pad leave him hungover, melancholy, and unable to remember his lines on the set of whatever B-grade TV show he's guest starring on that week.Rick's most lasting relationship has been with his stuntman/driver/chief enabler, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), whose reckless driving betrays a dangerous violent streak underneath his bright Hawaiian shirts and cocky comebacks. Rick and Cliff are openly contemptuous of hippies-DiCaprio, puffy and red-faced, screams at a car full of them wearing a half-open bathrobe and clutching a pitcher of margaritas at one point-and of Mexican people. Their conservative crankiness is a clear reflection of their insecurity about their place in a rapidly changing film industry (and world); it's an unflattering aspect of their personalities that's reflected in DiCaprio's vulnerable, admirably pathetic performance as the past-his-prime Rick.Tarantino's longtime editor, Sally Menke, died in 2010, and her absence is still palpable. But though Menke's assistant, Fred Raskin, stumbled with Django Unchained, he comes into his own with Once Upon A Time, indulging in high-wire experiments that further unmoor the film from conventional plotting. Entire sequences are cut in as flashbacks mid-scene, as when Cliff's idle remembrance of Rick's comment about him knowing better than to ask stunt coordinator Randy (Russell) for work leads to an extended scene of Cliff picking a fight with Bruce Lee-and, quite improbably, winning. (If, indeed, that's what really happened; in a movie obsessed with image and memory, Cliff may not be the most reliable of narrators.) But the Arrested Development of it all is most acutely felt in the conversations about Rick Dalton and his filmography, scenes heavily seasoned with quippy cutaways to footage of DiCaprio in fictional movies like The 14 Fists Of McLusky and Operazione Dy-no-mite!, alongside actual '60s classics like The Great Escape.The moment that gives us perhaps the clearest view of Once Upon A Time's complicated relationship with fame and a life lived through pop culture comes midway through the film, as Rick struggles through a scene opposite a younger cowboy star (Timothy Olyphant) on the latter's Western series. We know that we're watching the TV show within the film because DiCaprio's repeating dialogue we watched him practice earlier. But the scene is shot in the same aspect ratio and cut with the same rhythm as the larger film itself. We see neither crew nor cameras, and the only indication that this isn't \"really\" happening are voices offscreen feeding Rick/DiCaprio his lines-that is, until Rick nails the scene. Suddenly, the spell is broken, the camera pulls back, and the director, crew, and equipment all appear on the sidelines. For Rick-and, one assumes, for Tarantino-movies (or, in this case, TV) and life have become interchangeable, and failing at one essentially obliterates the other. What will both of them do, Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood wonders, when their moments of triumph are gone?", "The Last 60s Picture!": "While The Hateful Eight is neither Tarantino's finest, nor is it my favourite film by him, it's undeniably his most mature. This one is pretty much the exact opposite. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is wild, a bit rough around the edges and choppy (especially at its second act) and unrestrained to a fault. It also may be his most self-indulgent film to date. Nevertheless, all that is in a most engrossing and enthralling way... for the most part.Quentin Tarantino is one of my top 5 favourite film directors. Add to that a star-studded cast, most notably Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Margot Robbie and Leonardo DiCaprio (who's one of, if not my favourite actor of all-time). So there's no need to say how much I was exciting to see his latest film. Honestly, this was my most anticipated upcoming film in general. And I enjoyed it... I liked it... I loved it, but that doesn't mean I found it underwhelming!Tarantino had to capture the zeitgeist of the 60s, and he did. But he didn't stop here. He made a late 60s, or an early 70s, film through and through. Regardless of its advanced technical aspect, this film let us see how a Tarantino film would be like if he made films in the sixties (although I'm positive he would have made a more violent film). Unlike other Tarantino films, this one's plot unfolds in an unbound and kinda spontaneous manner. And I like these kind of films so much. Of course the music and the production design are spot-on, but Tarantino's outstandingly excellent grasp of the time period has surpassed all that.For what I've said above, complaining about the film's unfocused storytelling is both contradictory and unjust. Besides, Tarantino's films have never been straightforwardly narrated (The thing I adore). What bothered me is that in this film I felt, for the first time in a Tarantino film, that there are many unnecessary and (I hate to say it) pointless. These oddly intriguing scenes that contain dialogue which has nothing to do with the story yet still madly riveting are not as tasteful as usual. The reasons behind that, I assume, are that: the dialogue doesn't feel as refreshing or daring as in the other Tarantino films, and the scenes in themselves aren't very well-put together or well-combined. I'm not sure why I felt that (talking about the later reason), but maybe it's the editing or maybe it's because these scenes needed to be more longer to earn its weight.The humour also isn't the cunningly witty humour Tarantino is known for, but it still works fairly well nonetheless. The film is also not as violent and brutal as other Tarantino films, but boy the climactic scene! This is not to say Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is less engaging than Tarantino's other efforts. Don't worry, my eyes were glued to the screen as they always do while watching any of this brilliant filmmaker's films! What makes this film stand out among the rest of the films in Tarantino's filmography (besides the distinctive way its plot unfolds in) is that this one is undisputedly gentler and actually kinda warm!Talking about the acting is really unnecessary, but I guess I have to. First and Foremost, Leo and Brad Pitt have a remarkable chemistry that's definitely one of the best I've ever had the pleasure to see in any film. As for each one of them alone, they are both at their peak, but I can't say these are their best performances. I'm not that familiar with Sharon Tate. But for what I know about her style and her manner of speaking, I can say that Margot Robbie nailed it. She is fantastically energetic and innocently charming. It's definitely one of her best supporting performances. Al Pacino doesn't have much screen time, but I enjoyed seeing him. Both Margaret Qualley, who played Pussycat, and Julia Butters, who played the little girl, Trudi, are scene-stealers. I think both of them have very promising careers. I also liked the Stranger Things breakout star, Maya Hawk, despite appearing in very, very few scenes.I need to watch it one more time to decide whether it's my least favourite Tarantino or not, but, overall, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is a blast from start to finish that kept me on the edge of my seat all throughout. Its 161-min runtime just flew by. I mean, it's a Tarantino film at the end of the day!(8/10)", "What a fantastic allegory": "I have never considered myself a Tarantino fan as such, though I have seen most of his movies and they have always been interesting and decent movies. Given I have rated this movies so high though I think thats worth noting, I think as a stand alone movie this really was exceptional.I really wish I would have the chance to speak with the movie creators with this one to see if my interpretations match with their vision. There is so much here to unpack if you look into it.The movie has elements which hark back to a golden age, when people in Hollywood made movies and TV to entertain and to venerate hero's. At that same time this also seems to show so much that reflects modern society. You have the man who has been accused of a crime (killing his wife) and who everyone as judged and punished without any proof that the accusation is true. You have all the elements in hollywood which have led to its devolving into a mockery of itself, just repeating old stories and having no true imagination any more. Its all set to a background of a man who feels like he is over the hill, and struggling to come to terms with the way things are changing.All of this comes with a side story, which mimics the true stories of the manson family. Those who know the story of the mansons know these were left wing \"hippies\" as they were known, who preached love while in reality using this as nothing more than an excuse to justify terrible actions by calling people they didnt like fascists. In reality the story of the mansons involved a group of four innocent people, including a pregnant woman who was brutally murdered by several of the girls who supported manson and manson himself. This movie however does something truly brilliant with its ending. Instead of mirroring the reality, this movie instead has the final scene doing what Hollywood always did, it paints reality as though the bad guys can never win. Instead of reflecting what really happened our heros have a redemption arc, killing the evil hippies.I would be absolutely fascinated to speak with the creators of this movie and see if they agree with my interpretation, and if a movie can make you think this much while also entertaining you the whole time, well that movie is truly fantastic.", "This Movie is Almost 3 Hours!?": "There is no better compliment for a long movie than to not realize it is a long movie. It means that the movie is engaging enough to keep you invested for the entire run time. This is definitely one of those movies. Set prior to the Manson Family murders, Tarantino's new film follows a pretty boy actor whose career is coming to an end and his gopher stunt double and friend. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is trying to turn his dying career around, looking for one more breakthrough role, but its just not happening. Like many of the young pretty boy actors of classical Hollywood, he is just not transitioning to the new age of 60s Hollywood. Meanwhile, his only friend during this troubled period, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), is contentedly coasting through life. He has no qualms as long as he gets to work for his friend, but his carefree lifestyle runs him afoul of the notorious Manson Family. And then Tarantino happens.Tarantino knows how to design a world. In his own version of the 1960s, he crafts something that's wonderfully familiar and yet something all his own. His committment to the setting is phenomenal, bringing up even the smallest details that most wouldn't know. For instance, Italian movies of the time often would bring in actors from around the world and had them deliver their lines in their native languages, later redubbing them in post. There are even scenes where nothing is going on, and he just wants to show off his handiwork. Yet they don't drag the movie for an instant.In spite of the directors reputation, there is little violence in this movie. Two and a half hours of this movie has only occasional instances but the vast majority of it is dedicated to the drama of Dalton's floundering career. And none of it drags. DiCaprio and Pitt are charming and funny and the number of familiar faces that pop up is a stark reminder of talent seemingly forgotten in the modern age. But the gloves have to come off eventually, and Tarantino pulls no punches. That last ten minutes is brutal as only the most violent man in Hollywood could make it.This movie is a blast.", "Reminiscing": "This film truly allows the viewer to reminisce about the golden age of Hollywood, and in typical Tarantino style the film subverts the viewers expectation in a welcoming way.", "Slow burner that's worth every minute": "I can already hear the haters complaining that it's too long, too slow, and that there's not enough action. For a movie that takes such a leisurely pace to get to where it's going, it whizzed by for me. Part buddy pic, party homage to EVERYTHING going on in 1969, and part alternative universe. The entire thing works so well! Your ability to love, or hate the movie rests on how well you connect with Pitt & DiCaprio from the start. It's not a film about Sharon Tate, or Charles Manson, or the murders that followed. The story belongs to those two leads and everything else is done around them to tie the narrative together. A truly, rewarding and very mature movie from QT.", "Absolute Perfection": "Once upon a time in Hollywood is an absolutely beautiful and immersive love letter to the summer of 69, old time Hollywood, and the magic of cinematic imagination.If Tarantino, DiCaprio And Pitt don't all get Oscars the world is unjust. As someone that is fascinated by olden day Hollywood and also a Giant Sharon Tate fan (Margot kills it, unfortunately she's not on screen a lot. When she is though, she is perfection), there is so much to be marveled at, and I won't spoil anything about it, but I'll say that I left absolutely pleased with the way that every aspect is handled.It was nearly 3 hours of living out a fantasy for a person like me, but I'm fairly certain that Tarantino also lived out something magical that he needed to get out of himself.Perhaps his most personal and diverse film, he created something entertaining and beautiful! I couldn't be happier with the outcome. This one is instantly placed into my top films list.A+", "Terrific love-letter to Hollywood bygone years.": "Quentin Tarantino makes my heart race. Every film is overflowing with visual and aural references to the movie industry and the era that he venerates - the necessity of staying alert to barely hidden signs/symbols can be gleefully exhausting. ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD is about blurred boundaries - how the brutality and bloodshed spewing out of TV boxes and Movie Theaters intersects with and abets real-life drama. Tarantino also targets personal and intimate concerns, mindful of the aging process - particularly in the airless Hollywood environment of illusion and make-believe, celebrating the fantasy of eternal youth and beauty. Tarantino's work is known for being excessively violent - but that violence is often interrupted by a rivulet of dialogue hovering over the action - words that can make you burst out laughing - while you gasp and suck in your breath with repulsion witnessing through half-shut eyes some hard-hitting body pummeling.The director, Quentin Tarantino is one of a kind - and kind he often is not. But the latest film in his \"historical revision trilogy\" ( INGLORIOUS BASTARDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED) and now ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD has a sweetness that permeates through the oft feeling of menace and exhilaration running through the 1960's decade which experienced Viet Nam, Apollo 11 - putting a man on the Moon, the Stonewall riots, Woodstock and the focus of Tarantino's latest twisting of historical fact into digestible pop-culture fables - the Manson Murders.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Rick Dalton an increasingly insecure TV star floundering in \"feature\" movies, who spends most of his days with his loyal doppelganger, stunt-man, chauffeur, and best friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt - better than ever) speeding along with music blaring, curving around the Hollywood Hills from Dalton's plush home to his acting job on the location set - driving cars that are as shiny and handsome as the two leading men. The loquacious Di Caprio exhibiting an occasional hesitant stutter, is pitted against the literally strong, silent Booth who is an authentic, confident macho hero - a man with a \"past\" - devoted to Dalton who is in the midst of an existential crisis spurred on by a meeting with a a sleazy agent (Al Pacino) who utters some callous truths making Dalton realize that \"time\" and \"hard living\" is taking its toll on his celebrity and a career move to Rome is advisable. This gives Tarantino an opportunity to pay homage to \"spaghetti-western\" directors like Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci.Tarantino who never lacks for humor and irony, weaves into the film a particularly emotional moment exposing Rick Dalton who is recovering from a drunken, chain-smoking night, croaking and hacking - sitting with a book next to a precocious 8 year old \"method actor\" quietly rehearsing her lines for a scene they will be doing together (a wonderful Julia Butters.) The contrast could not be more evident. Their conversation and the subsequent filming of that scene is powerfully poignant revealing to Rick Dalton the possibilities of \"greatness\" as an actor. Leonardo DiCaprio's potency as a cinematic \"idol\" also prevails.ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD spotlights a Tarantino fairy-tale event where historical facts are altered and subverted. Living right next door to Rick Dalton in the film are Roman Polanski, his wife Sharon Tate and her ex-lover Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch.) The actual vicious mass murder of Tate, Sebring and two friends on the night of August 8-9th,1969 is emblematic of the 60's era: of hippiedom, cult living, gurus, drugs - all crystallized into the person of Charles Manson with his band of mainly middle-class female followers who serve as a blueprint from which to pivot true life into myth. Interwoven throughout the film are glimpses of the Manson \"women\" - presences that flicker in and out of our awareness,\nhitchhiking, dumpster diving, etc. their youthful, lithe bodies enjoying one another's company like fresh sprites on the horizon - just barely in our view.Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) in what will be a classic movie moment to be remembered picks up a 17 year old cult hitchhiker and drives her to the Manson compound - a directorial flash of brilliance as Tarantino plays with the pictorial barrenness of the locale and the theater audience's knowing-what-we-know, creating an intensity that is palpable involving a striking cameo scene with Bruce Dern.", "QT's fun and deadly valentine to 1969's La-La-land hits all the right marks with sparkle from Robbie, a knowing wink by Di Caprio and an Oscar worthy turn by Pitt": "ONCE UPON A TIME ...IN HOLLYWOOD (2019) ***1/2 Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Timothy Olyphant, Dakota Fanning, Kurt Russell, Luke Perry, Al Pacino, Damine Lewis, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Mike Mo, Lorenza Izzo, Michael Madsen, Rumer Willis, Bruce Dern, Damon Herriman, Scoot McNairy, Clifton Collins Jr. , Rebecca Gayheart, Martin Kove, Clu Gulager, Brenda Vaccaro, Nicholas Hammond. Quentin Tarantino's love letter and fabled valentine to LA circa 1969 with fun cast focusing on has-been actor Rick Dalton (a wise tweak and knowing wink to how it could be for a movie star fading fast) and his best bud/stunt double Cliff Booth (scene-stealing Pitt having a field day) with the sun-dappled backdrop of La-La-Land and the shadow of Charles Manson looming on the horizon. Tarantino continues his success with a jukebox of vintage tunes, sweet rides and gobsmacked tourist postcard shots of Tinsletown's landmarks (all neon and bulging marquees as far as the eye can see). Robbie's sweet turn as Sharon Tate is lovely and QT wisely allows the late actress onscreen time as herself in a MATT HELM film and while his gift of gab sometimes sputters the last act is a humdinger and once again Pitt, I can't strongly recommend more highly for a Best Supporting Actor nom whether he's doting on his pit bull, kicking Bruce Lee's ass or tangoing with the sinister hippie family of Manson he proves his low-key charm has unbridled still waters running deep. One of the year's more entertaining films too boot.", "An end of an era movie about the end of an era?": "Big budget blockbusters with adult themes and limited special effects are a dying breed in Hollywood. Quentin Tarantino is one of the few auteurs that makes them anymore. And if Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood is one of the last of a dying breed, it's an awfully good picture to go out on.As Tarantino regales about another dying breed 50 years ago, he packs his script with enough references and self-references for 10 movies. He concocts a detailed back-story for his lead with a filmography and film clips galore. There are also several movies within the movie. You'd probably have to watch it 3 or 4 times and take a graduate-level course on Hollywood in the 60s to catch all the Easter eggs- one that I haven't seen mentioned-Cliff's wife has a sister, Natalie, and the mystery of the wife's demise mirrors that of Natalie Wood. That's just one of like 1000.His depiction of Los Angeles in 1969 is an astounding feat. How are they driving down an LA freeway in broad daylight with what looks like actual traffic with nothing but 1960s cars? It doesn't look like CGI because it isn't! They shut down the highway! They built the storefronts, and recreated the movie posters, the interiors, and even the Spahn Ranch with obsessive attention to detail. It absolutely looks like 1969. It's utterly immersive.They didn't move the camera like this in 1969, though--long tracking shots following cars and horses and swooping crane shots over long-lost LA landmarks that take your breath away. I was giddy watching it. It'd be a great movie even without dialogue. But the script will have a good shot at an Oscar. The performances and casting are basically flawless. I wouldn't be surprised if DiCaprio snags another statue--and he might not be the only one.I really don't understand people that don't care for this picture. Is it a generational thing? The references are eluding the younger audience? They know little or nothing about schlocky 60s movies or TV or the Manson family? It's moves too slow for them? It's too long? (On a price per entertaining minute basis this might be the best deal ever!) Do they not appreciate real old-fashioned movie making that doesn't use CGI as a crutch? Because this film will be studied in film classes in 50 years, or 100 years. As a technical achievement, it's that good.The story is plenty good too, although if you are over a certain age like the director and myself, it will have more resonance. And it contains ample QT-style revenge for the schmoes who came for the ultra-violence.I guess I don't get what's not to like. It is a sublime movie going experience. I wonder how much longer they're going to make 'em like this. Outside of Tarantino and the Coens, maybe they've already stopped.", "His Best Yet": "I think it's his best work. He breaks every rule along the way and this will offend the easily offended. It's a masterpiece.", "Entertaining and surprisingly genial movie": "I'd been hesitant to watch this film because I'd heard there was extreme violence and so the first thing I want to mention is all the violence in this movie is in one 10-minute scene and outside of that's it's pretty much a shambling goof of a movie.Basically it creates a fictional duo, an actor and his stuntman/driver, and puts them in the midst of a famous historical moment. It's a weird idea, and very much true to the title, but it works. It's basically an amusing buddy picture.There are some terrific things in this movie. One of my favorite scenes is the way Tarantino shot Cliff's visit to the Hollywood set taken over by the Manson family as though it were an old-school western. And there's an absolutely lovely scene that is simply Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate enjoying her movie.Of the films I've seen by Tarantino this is the one that's closest to a feel-good movie. It starts a little slow, but overall it's just very enjoyable. I'd recommend it.", "Definitely an acquired taste": "Let me just put this out here, if you're a huge fan of Tarantino's violent, bloody shoot 'em up films, you'll HATE this movie. If you're like me and a huge fan of Jackie Brown, a movie that contained very little blood and relied solely on storytelling, you'll LOVE this movie. I saw it twice this week. The performances were brilliant all around. Pitt gave one of the best performances of his career. The soundtrack and scenery were breathtaking. A lot of people complain that there was no plot, but that's simply not true. It's about two neighbors, both actors, one who's career is just starting, and the other who's career hit a slump. And you won't be able to stop thinking about the ending. I highly recommend giving this movie a chance.", "Tarantino's settlement with Hollywood": "Excellently played by DiCaprio and Pitt. Great shots, I wondered whether drones were used. Wonderful irony (or should I say sarcasm?), at times it feels that Tarantino is mocking an entire industry. But no, he does it with so much love, immersing the viewer into the touch and feel of a movie studio. And he's still riding his Western horse and, of course, there's classic Tarantino style violence that is shown in his old entertaining way that even made me laugh. Incredible mixture of homage and persiflage.", "This is great": "It's hard to describe. It's kind of like Pulp Fiction but really it's new ground for Tarantino. The story has nothing to prove, the dialogue is to the point and realistic while still being very funny, and the chronology sometimes played with with but without becoming a gimmick (kind of like Pulp Fiction). This story is direct and spares metaphors or morals for a classic in-your-face saga. And yes, there's so much awesome violence you've come to expect. If you're 2 hours in and still waiting for it, just be a little more patient.", "Extraordinary way to change history": "Simply put, don't miss the opportunity to watch this, with one caveat, after you do, read the true story behind it. Thank you Tarantino for you bravery and mastery, thanks to all the casting that still raises the bar, and to the crew. This is cinematography.", "The film enjoys the freedom of detail": "Content to be tied to history, the film enjoys the freedom of detail, and co-stars leonardo dicaprio and brad Pitt create timeless performances. Director quentin tarantino is eager to pay tribute to the creative passion of storytelling. This is his ninth film, and he really should be doing more in the future, but the outdated western TV and the forgotten characters on the track haven't achieved much in the way of integration. Still, the film has its own ambitions, and quentin tarantino's layered script is so loaded with narrative threads that it takes on a dizzying rhythm.", "More self-indulgence from the most over-rated director in living memory": "Beware spoilers!Rick is a fading star of westerns and action films and TV series in the late 60s. He hangs around with his underused stunt double Cliff, who is also his buddy, driver, and general gofer. Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate have just moved in next door. Rick is experiencing insecurity as his career dwindles, while Cliff gives a cute underdressed teen a lift to the Spahn Ranch where her distinctly unsettling commune lives. 6 months later, Sharon Tate, is pregnant, and Rick returns from Italy with 4 spaghetti westerns under his belt, a new Italian wife, and insufficient resources to keep employing Cliff. They have just returned to Rick's house after a final celebration when 4 members of the Manson family turn up, ready to carry out the celebrated Sharon Tate murders. One of them runs away, the other 3 enter Rick's house where Cliff kills 2 of them, getting injured, Rick kills the other one then goes to have a cup of tea with Sharon Tate as Rick goes off to hospital.Yes, the Sharon Tate murders never happened. Would that it were so.I was not disappointed with this film because I have never subscribed to the view that Tarantino is a masterpiece-making wunderkind. He is undoubtedly hugely talented, but he also has a terrible propensity for self-indulgence which he exercises at the expense of the film he is making: the film is in service to Tarantino rather than vice versa. The labelling of this offering as \"The 9th film by Quentn Tarantino\" is arrogant and pretentious in equal measure.This film has many, many flaws. They include:\n1. Lengthy shots of people driving around during which nothing happens and which serve no purpose.\n2. A huge amount of time during which Tarantino shows us that he can emulate the look and feel of 60s movies. We know, Quentin.\n3. Various plot elements introduced which turn out to have little or no plot relevance: the death of Cliff's wife, George Spahn, and Rick's interaction with the girl actor, to name but 3.There are enjoyable elements here - the girl is excellent - but they combine together to add at least an hour to the running time without moving the film an inch further forward. The film is vastly padded because Tarantino loves the sound of his own voice too much. There are those who will say it is his loving homage to Holywood. To which I say \" Watch Hugo, Quentin, and see how Scorsese's love story to cinema is intertwined with a proper story.\"I have chosen to spoiler the absence of the Tate murders. This not because I didn't like the would-be murderers getting a comeuppance they avoided in real life - far from it. But the film trades on a real-life tragedy to put rear end on seats, and then plays Tarantino games with it. It is used as a PR trick rather being addressed in the way it deserves.Tarantino's genuine cinematic gift comes out in the scene where Cliff encounters the Family at the Spahn Ranch. The unsettling sense of unease is cleverly built up and used. I wish the rest of the film had used its time as profitably. But Tarantino's self-indulgence overpowers everything.", "A film I will surely watch multiple times": "One of the most enjoyable times I've had at the movies in years. DiCaprio is simply wonderful complimented by a nuanced, delicious Brad Pitt. Margo Robbie is stunning and delivers a very sensitive, lovely Sharon Tate. Can't wait to watch it again and again. Kudos to Kurt Russell. Truly one of Tarantino's best. Bravo", "Tarantino has done it again!!! Masterpiece": "Tarantino delivers an incredible movie with its own genre/style! He creates a perfect image of the 60s! Also has great acting from Leo, Brad, and Margot! I think it is better than pulp fiction now! Very fun film!!! Please go see this! You won't regret it!", "Tarantino's La La Land": "Quentin Tarantino loves cinema, there is absolutely no denying that. With that being said, there was probably no one better suited to making a film such as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood than him, with its sun-soaked framing of Los Angeles and array of colourful characters serving as an ode to the Golden Age of Hollywood.It's 1969 and faded Hollywood actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), along with his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), find themselves struggling to find fame and stay relevant amidst the end of Hollywood's Golden Age.Plenty has been made of the narrative choices and how prominent a role Margot Robbie has to play in the film prior to its release but I feel these people have missed the idea of the film and just need something to post about to keep hits coming on their sites. Tarantino has made a love letter to an era of Hollywood that majorly inspired him, and Robbie's role, as with others throughout the film, have a small part to play in a much bigger tapestry. More on that later though.The main focus here is Dalton and Booth, both on their friendship and their desire to keep working amidst an ever-changing Hollywood landscape. It feels a little restrained for a Tarantino film however, that only makes it a more interesting and personal piece of work from the eccentric filmmaker. Because of that, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood becomes one of his most emotional films to date, the journey Dalton goes on in particular driving the film forward to one hell of a finale, bringing the violence you'd expect in a Tarantino film.The restraint shown in places doesn't mean this doesn't feel like a Tarantino film at all, the exquisite cinematography from Robert Richardson sweeping between Hollywood sets and lavish lifestyles. There is of course intricate details in the production design that Tarantino just wouldn't make a film without, as with the costume designs, and the choice of music for the soundtrack is so on-point that Hollywood in the late 60s really is brought to life in fantastic fashion.Coming to the performances, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is led by two great performances from two accomplished actors in Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. There's a number of scenes where the two just hang out together and, thanks to their dynamic chemistry and well-written dialogue, I could have spent hours on end in their company. DiCaprio is utterly brilliant in the role of Dalton, a man so scared of being forgotten and left behind, while Pitt shines as Booth, both men having worked with Tarantino before so effectively.There's a whole host of supporting characters and cameos throughout, some coming in anecdotal flashbacks, that some may see as over-indulgence from Tarantino but I felt it kept the ball rolling on quite a long film. Margot Robbie has the most prominent appearance of all the supporting characters and, while her Sharon Tate is used very sparingly, Robbie certainly makes a lasting impression, her undeniable screen presence lighting up the film.It's by no means his best film however, Quentin Tarantino has made another film in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that will be regarded as a classic in the years to come. Some have said it's far too long for the story it's trying to tell but I'd happily spend more time in this world with these characters.", "Requiem for Sharon": "The killing is brutal and hard to watch, but justified; it's the \"Death Wish\" exemption, they had it coming to them. In \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\", the historical revisionist is at it again, rewriting Joan Didion's assertion that \"the sixties ended abruptly on that August night in 1969,\" the day when Tex Watson, Susan \"Sadie\" Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel, disciples of Charles Manson, broke into the Roman Polanski estate on Cicelo Drive, and left California screaming in its wake. Tarantino gives the 1960s a four-month stay, passing on the dishonor to Altamont, the troubled music festival headlined by The Rolling Stones as being the official funeral for peace and love, the anti-Woodstock experience. That's because the killers go to the wrong house. Sharon Tate, along with Abigail Folger and Jay Sebring, survive the close encounter. Since \"The Family\" members die in such grisly fashion, a curious thing happens. The filmmaker puts the onus on the cult leader, not its followers, in this phantasmagorical world. Sean Durkin's \"Martha Marcy May Marlene\" shows how a charismatic man can transform innocent children into cold-blooded killers. With their Ford Galaxie parked roadside, the male driver and his female passenger-side companion start to banter about popular culture, reminds us of their relative youth. This peculiar relatability that the filmmaker instills in the audience still lingers, when the docudrama-like narrative goes wayward. Tarantino, in a sense, rewrites the film with a \"Minority Report\"-like, or maybe, even Orwellian sensibility. He knows the historical record. He knows the killers' collective \"thoughtcrime\". Cliff Booth) a WWII veteran-turned-stuntman, not only dispatches the would-be murderers in Grand Guignol fashion, but he also murders the idealism of flower children, along with the nihilism of flower children in lambs clothing, both, who were both anti-establishment. To a man like Cliff, the infantrymen in the war, contemporaneous to the film, are their stuntmen. Lest not the audience forget, Brad Pitt played Lt. Aldo Raine in the WWII period piece \"Inglorious Basterds\".Cliff's boss, television actor Rick Dalton(Leonardo DiCaprio), a studio system dinosaur roaming aimlessly in \"New Hollywood\", never did any military service, but he pays Cliff, which makes the stuntman a sort of mercenary soldier, like \"The Dirty Dozen\" encapsulated into a single man. At Spahn Ranch, the studio lot where they shot \"Bounty Law\", the television western that Rick a measure of fame, has turned into a ghost town, overrun by a new sheriff in town, Charles Manson(Damon Herriman) and a group of drug-addled desperados, \"The Family\", playing cowboy. After Cliff Booth, a classic antihero(the stunt man may have killed his wife) checks up on the ranch owner, he returns to find a shirtless hippie, and an intentionally-flattened tire. The stunt man nearly beats the vandal to death. Cliff, a WII veteran, and his employer are old school; they don't think much of their replacements. These unwashed people belong on motorcycles, not horses. Upon Cliff's arrival, Cliff, a stranger to these parts, cues Tex Watson(Austin Butler), a \"homesteader\", who comes charging bareback through the wild west movie set, bringing the cowtown fa\u00c3\u00a7ade to life. This is not your father's rodeo, though. The filmmaker, a student of genre, evokes the acid western, which were journeys toward death in a nightmare society, best exemplified by Monte Hellman's \"The Shooting\" and \"Ride the Wild Wind\". It's no \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\"(the inspiration behind \"Bounty Law\"), this performative simulacrum, like something out of a theme park exhibition. The coexistence of the stunt man and Manson Family acolytes is representative of genre and subgenre, respectively; a contemporaneous dissonance in which Cliff attempts to reverse the alchemy of westerns, or rather, remythologize the myth inherent in John Ford films, by rescuing George Spahn(Bruce Dern), the owner of the ranch, from these bohemian cowboys. Cliff, however, is eight years too late. He is like Natalie Wood, playing Debbie, in \"The Searchers\"; Debbie never asked to be rescued from her new family, the Comanche tribe who kidnapped her. Ethan Edwards(John Wayne) didn't search fast enough either. George used to be an anachronism, just like the 1966 Cadillac de Ville parked in the middle of this fictive one-horse town. But now he is one of them, an unwitting accomplice to the potentiality for helter skelter, and on a filmic level, a man who remakes himself as a survival tactic, professionally(and literally). It's not his fault that he became a turncoat. The occupation of Spahn Ranch can be traced back to a bad career decision made by Rick Dalton. Without realizing it, Rick contributed to the sea change. \"Bounty Law\" was a hit with the American viewing public, but the show's star thought he could transition into film, since his name, at the outset, was attached to an early version of John Sturges' \"The Great Escape\", in which he was slated to play Captain Virgil Hills, a rebellious British commonwealth soldier who orchestrates the breakout of a POW camp. The studio passed on Rick, picking Steve McQueen(Damian Lewis) instead, which catapulted \"The King of Cool\" pass his small-screen contemporary and into the Hollywood constellation of stars. This deep animosity Rick feels toward hippies is an insincere prejudice, because had he secured the part, it would be him and not McQueen, hobnobbing with Michelle Phillips(Rebecca Rittenhouse) and her ilk at the Playboy mansion hobnobbing with other counterculture types.The blowtorch cools down. The LAPD officers fish the charred remains of Sadie Atkins(Mikey Madison) from the swimming pool. Tex Watson and Patricia Krenwinkel(Madison Beaty) didn't survive the pit bull bites. Brandie, Cliff's dog, craves cheap wet dog food topped with kibble, and blood. The stunt man is taken away by ambulance, leaving Rick alone, standing alone in his carport, where just minutes ago, he told the hunting party to get lost. And then Jay Sebring(Emile Hirsch), a body in the crime scene photo, like a resurrection, appears at Polanski's gate and asks his neighbor about the hubbub. Lazarus' sister, Sharon Tate(Margot Robbie), the focal point of Quentin Tarantino's requiem for The Manson Family victims, invite the journeyman actor to her Benedict Canyon estate via telecom. Rick knows that she is the gatekeeper, the woman who can introduce him to Roman Polanski(Rafal Zariwuecha) and other A-list talent. Tate will soon realize, through broadcast news and newspapers, the association between the dead youth and Charles Manson, and that Rick's intervention saved her life. She is going to recognize Manson as that stranger who knocked on her door, asking for Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson, the previous tenant. Tate, as a promising up-and-comer, who became something of a household name after playing a French \"art film\" actress in Mark Robson's \"Valley of the Dolls\", she has the power to rehabilitate a career in decline. But it's her beau, Roman Polanski, fresh off the commercial and critical success of \"Rosemary's Baby\", whom Rick gets all starry-eyed over. He underestimates Sharon. The proverbial guest star-level showbiz industry hack doesn't mention, or perhaps, even register the ethereal blonde as a presence riding shotgun, when he and his unofficial chauffeur first spot the famous couple, stopping at the remote-controlled gate in their fancy European sports car. Especially now, fresh off his success as the lead in a string of \"spaghetti westerns\". Rick sees Sharon as little more than Polanski's muse; his inferior, with a complete unawareness of their diverging positions on the Hollywood food chain. Rick Dalton echoes the hubris that infects a washed-up comedian in Charlie Chaplin's \"Limelight\". Calvero(Charlie Chaplin), too, in the 1952 film, saves a life, Thereza Embrose(Claire Bloom), a ballerina par excellence, which he mistakenly presumes to be a streetwalker. After watching Thereza audition for his old theater company, Calvero sits with the lights out, a darkness that internalizes a deep shame born from his indescribable faux pas, imagining the dancer as a potential partner in vaudeville, a lowbrow art, during the dream sequence. The ballerina gets the clown a job.There is no transcendent Sharon Tate performance we can point to. Her death was unfair. What Tarantino does is recast Tate in people's minds as an actress with a flair for comedy. He pares down her short career to a single scene from Phil Karlson's largely-forgotten \"The Wrecking Crew\", in which she holds her own, doing slapstick, opposite Dean Martin. She plays against type; a klutz. Margot Robbie has few lines; it's a silent movie within a movie, a nod, perhaps, to Berenice Bejo's performance as a late-twenties era movie actress in Michel Hazanavicius' \"The Artist\". Peppy Miller makes the transition into sound pictures. Her pull revives the career of George Valentin(Jean Dujardin), a silent film star, who doesn't survive the talkies, just like how Rick Dalton's career floundered when the studio system dissolved. George never attains the same level of notoriety and fame, but at least he's relevant again, thanks to his generous insider patron. Polanski, who would direct \"What?\", a 1972 Italian production, starring Marcelo Mastroianni, seems perfect for Rick, since he is already a known entity in the Italian film industry. But this is about Sharon. Did she have the potential to be a true artist. Quentin Tarantino seems to think so.That's good enough for me.", "Tarantino's Love Letter to film cinema and the first must watch film of 2019!": "So I just saw the new Quentin Tarantino movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood at the theater. This was easily my most hyped movie of the year. I absolutely love Quentin Tarantino so my expectations were very high all around. I am happy to say this movie met my expectations and went beyond. It may actually be one of my favorite Tarantino films and easily a major Oscar contender.In typical Quentin Tarantino fashion the plot of the movie is all over the place. The film juxtaposes a few real life actors into one leading man, Rick Dalton as he and his aging stunt man come to term with their less than Blockbuster status in Hollywood. Of course the meat of the film involves incredible character interactions mixing action, humor, drama and suspense to make a truly fascinating love letter to cinema. Plus the movie incorporated the Manson Murders into the background as a fun plot device that really added an interesting element to the film.The movie had so many strong selling points as a film. In typical Quentin Tarantino fashion the dialogue was so sharp it is guaranteed to keep the viewer entertained. The movie really did have a perfect mix of comedy and drama, all while playing fast and loose with real life characters and events. I constantly found myself mesmerised at the screen with the dialogue and screenplay choices.This really felt like Quentin Tarantino's most personal film. The movie was an absolute love letter to cinema and the people that crafted films that were so influential in his career. As a fan of Cinema the movie was an absolute blast to watch. Picking up all the little Easter eggs left just for all the cinephiles out there was half the fun of the film. This movie absolutely demands to be seen multiple times.It would be impossible to talk about a Tarantino movie without mentioning the directing choices. The film was so expertly shot and directed it was almost hard to pay attention to the content because I wanted to pay attention to the technical aspects. The soundtrack as always was perfectly blended into the film acting almost as a driving character in itself. This easily was one of the best directed and shot films of the year.In every way Tarantino captured the era of the film and utilized a really cool play-within-a-play concept that really paid tribute to the art of film making. The concept really made for some trully memorable moments and really showcased the range of talent that went into this film. The writing and screenplay did a great job setting up the initial conflict and playing with viewers expectations. Despite having a large cast and switching multiple perspectives throughout the film the movie never felt bloated. Everything felt so deliberate and tied into the larger themes of the film.Speaking of talent Leonardo DiCaprio really made this role his own. Throughout the film he was forced to wear so many different hats as a character, but still kept his character grounded as a real human being struggling with life stressors. A lesser actor could not have played such a diverse and demanding role.Brad Pitt absolutely oozed charisma throughout the film. His character seemed to pick up from Inglourious Basterds and turned into one of Brad Pitt's best performances in years. He and DiCaprio genuinely had an outstanding screen presence together. I really can't complain about a single actor in the entire film. It is always nice to see the Quentin Tarantino regulars appear in his films.Of course like all Tarantino films this movie will not be for everyone. While I really enjoyed the dialogue-heavy sequences and multiple character perspectives, the film does have a way of rambling in a stream of thought kind of way. I could see people getting lost and wondering where the movie was heading. Plus the film plays very loose with historical facts. Both points feel a bit shallow criticizing in the film for however. It seemed Tarantino explicitly designed the film in such a manner.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has been my favorite film of 2019. It is the kind of movie that reminds me how much I love Cinema. From the smart and witty dialogue to the intricate directing choices the film is sure to please all fans of well made film. Sure the plot can initially feel overwhelming, but this is one of those films where the experience is more important than the ending. A 9.75 out of 10.", "A New Experiment And Experience In Film History": "Pulp Fiction meets The Player in this Tarantino style roller coaster. A new genre of its own, OUATIH is Tarantino's and Brad Pitt's best work since Inglourious Basterds respectively. There isn't a moment in this film that bores us and the actors look as lively as ever.A mini star studded ensemble which deals with the life in Hollywood at 1960s leading to one of the most notorious moments in the town. The main characters in the film are Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), a fading actor and his dapper stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) with Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) having the time of her life. Like Tarantino said, it's better to watch this film without knowing anything about it's plot.The third act is probably Tarantino's best work in his career so far and there isn't a more fitting finale in this ride. Come awards season we can see OUATIH bagging multiple nomination and also potentially winning a few. By far the best film of this summer and probably the year too.", "Amazing talent, brilliant, genuine movie.": "First of all, the very best is not reading anything about this Tarantino movie at all before you go to the theatre. And yes, this one is really for the big screen not for home.Secondly, this was easily one of the best 3 hours at a theatre in my life, where nobody was eating any popcorn not drinking during the movie. And nobody wanted to believe it was over.The film is more the superb, the acting is brilliant, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio have fantastic chemistry, both play their best in their career.\nEverything is so layered, all the details fit, the storytelling is top notch, the script is unique, the directing is the greatest I've ever seen, soundtrack is perfect, cinematography is outstanding.And yes, this bit tops Pulp Fiction easily, although -without spoiling anything- it's totally different from every aspects.\nTarantino does not repeat itself, this is nothing what made earlier.Funny, entertaining, the suspense is thrilling and the twists are so surprising.Yes, this movie is a perfect storytelling, how a movie must tell a story. This is not a documentary, don't expect that. Yet, it is able to grasp a world we can't see anymore and take the audience to a journey where we can be a part of it.Very, very artistic movie by Tarantino, nothing like he made before.", "Damn Hippies": "Thanks to the mostly spoiler-free trailer, I didn't know what to expect going into Once Upon A Time...in Hollywood. I had hoped it would be respect to Sharon Tate and her family and, thankfully, I do think it was. What surprised me most was how little of Sharon there really is in the film. She only has a handful of lines, but Margot Robbie makes the best of what she has to work with.The real stars here are Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt who turn in career-best performances as a western actor and his stuntman/best friend who get caught up in Hollywood regime changes, feeling useless, and a crazed group of hippies run by some guy named Charlie Manson.At well over 2 1/2 hours, there's plenty of room for tedium and boredom to set it, but I was so engrossed that I couldn't even leave to go to the restroom. Once the finale rolls around, it's totally worth it. It's a real crowd pleaser.", "Great Character Driven Film": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's nostalgic tribute to Hollywood. At its center is the story of an aging actor coming to terms with his declining significance in a evolving industry. The craziness of the era provides the backdrop.It's a long movie, mostly dialog driven. I knew that going in, but frankly I didn't even notice as that characters were so well defined and the script so sharp that the time flew by. I especially enjoyed Brad Pitts character that was the epitome of the tough guy of the roles that DiCaprios character was known for. The time that they shared the screen was cinema magic; It was at times funny, touching, and violent. Great pacing, fantastic performances, and a engaging story makes this an all time classic. Go see it.", "It's a movie about......something": "If I had to describe the movie in a single word I'd say \"boring\".Things happened on screen, but at the same time nothing really happened. The movie inside the movie looked more interesting than most of the other stuff that was shown.About 1 hour into the movie I checked my smartphone clock because I didn't really see the movie going anywhere interesting. The question \"where are they going with this?\" constantly popped up in my mind because it just didn't make any sense. Some characters were completely unnecessary for the movie but still had a lot of screen time (Margo Robbie for example).I also couldn't really identify what this movie wanted to be. It had elemends from thrillers, documentatries, slasher flicks as well as parodies. But the combination wasn't good but rather felt randomly mashed together. I had a good laugh at the ending, but there was just to much nonsense before that which meant I couldn't really enjoy it.At the end I was just happy that these 2 1/2 hours were over and actually wanted to have them back. Feeling like I wasted over 2 hours is not really good...The actors did a good job with the material they had though.", "QT...... Done it again.... Thank you": "29 August 2019\nFilm of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. In\nNovember 2014 Quentin Tarantino stated that he would retire from film making after\nhis tenth film, I hope he didn't mean it because Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is his ninth and I don't think the world is ready for him to stop after the next one. Like\nMarmite, you love or hate him and his style of film making. The storyline takes time\nto evolve and the latter stages of the film are certainly worth waiting for. In this film the attention to detail was outstanding. Set in 1960s Hollywood we are treated to a\nassault on the eyes and ears. Radio footage heard in the cars for example is all\noriginal and there are many references to stars and films prior and up to that era. The\nadvertisements, the drinks, the music, fashions and language have all been\nmeticulously portrayed and a swathe of stars are gracing our screen from Kurt\nRussell to Damien Lewis. Our two main stars Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio are\nboth exemplary in their roles and both bring a roundness of character and a maturity\nto their roles as befits the standard of actor I believe they have both grown into. A\nwonderful piece of film making, thank you Mr Tarantino.", "Don't waste your time.": "Not only is this film one of the most boring films I've ever seen, it's 2 hours 40 minutes of boring. I'm very disappointed. Great actors are in the cast, great director, and that's it. I really tried my hardest to keep watching hoping it would get better, but no, quite the opposite.", "Tarantino number 9": "We inch closer to the number 10 for Tarantino which is to be his apparent last. If you look at Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, you'll be slightly annoyed by the previous comment. This film is Tarantino and is one of the best 2019 films. Strong style and historical changes, this is Tarantino at his best. The film lacks his usual cool banter and we are left with some strong character creations. Great film and you'll be left with one very different film viewing. Keep supporting these filmmakers.", "WORTH THE HYPE!": "This is truly Quentin Tarantino's best film. It has the perfect ensemble for a movie set in the retro age of Los Angeles. It's outrageously funny, perfectly written storyline, and sets the right mood for the audience. Profoundly excellent!", "A great screenplay by an even greater Director in Quentin Tarantino....deserves Oscars galore": "This was a very interesting and engaging film with an expected yet still surprising ending even for a Quentin Tarantino standard. Mrs. Shullivan and I watched the film Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood after just seeing another Oscar contender \"Joker\". The Joker was a complete disappointment for us but Tarantino's latest and greatest film just kept getting better and better as each scene progressed until the film end credits rolled onto the screen. It IS fantastic from the beginning, right through to the end.The acting in Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood was superb, and the on screen relationship between the past his prime TV screen star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his long time stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) was thoroughly energetic and captivating. There was a top ten supporting cast throughout the film that even included Cliff Booth's gorgeous and well trained Pitbull dog named Brandy that surprisingly added great value to any of the scenes that included Cliff Booth and his Pitbull dog Brandy.It wasn't until Mrs. Shullivan and I had watched almost eighty (80) percent of the film that we realized how Tarantino had kept his record intact by surprising the hell out of us on how he ended his latest bona fide blockbuster film. Tarantino never seizes to do anything but weave a most intriguing story line by providing his audience with hints (if you are attentive enough) with many intriguing twists and turns to a thoroughly enjoyable film climax.No spoiler alert because the ending is so darn good that even Walt Disney couldn't have utilized Cliff Booth's dog Brandy any better in his starring role. We loved the whole movie but especially the ending. Wow!A perfect 10 out of 10 rating", "And...": "Just judging by all the terrible reviews it's hard to understand why people who don't truly understand this particular style or genre even\nBother with a Review... I thought it was almost perfect, inglorious Bastard styled cinematic genius. The Academy understands .. most of the User Reviewers DONT.", "Pitt and Decaprio Shine for QT": "Quinten Tarantino has made a lot of good movies, but this has to be my favorite. The chemistry between Pitt and Decaprio was fantastic, along with each of the actors giving great performances. The screenplay was extremely creative, and the ending was one hell of a final scene to cap off a movie filled with plenty of comedy, and an emersive look into 1960's Hollywood.", "Nostalgic Yet Fresh": "I must admit I have not thoroughly enjoyed a Tarantino movie since Kill Bill so I approached Once Upon a Time in Hollywood with equal parts hope and hesitation. Not to say any of his movies are bad, far from it, they all have merit. It's just that I feel a lot of the modern Tarantino movies have been so over the top, polished, and indulgent that they almost become parodies of themselves. I prefer his more measured and rough around the edges freshman efforts. But my oh my, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was an absolute delight, and despite all the pretense with which I approached it, it felt like a breath of fresh air.The movies plays out like a fictionalized historical piece about a very specific, very late 60s moment in American history. Woven in with the star-studded and morbid tale of Sharon Tate is a fading macho Hollywood front man and his almost super humanly capable stunt double. There characters are both firmly rooted in the nostalgia of the era while bringing some sense of realism by portraying the turpitude that likely would accompany the lives of people who may appear immortally cool on the big screen. Rick Dalton is deeply insecure about his acting abilities to the point of almost breaking down at the sign of his career descending, a far cry from the calm and collected presence he assumes when in character on set. His stunt double Cliff lives in a rundown trailer, probably killed his wife, and his combative personality has prevented him from achieving and true success. We like these characters but their flaws are out there for all to see and it paints them apart from the traditionally Hollywood protagonist but not to the point of become a more played out anti-hero archetype.It also is no accident that they always seem to be driving against the arrows on the road, coughing while chain smoking, and drinking excessively to the point where their livers must look worse than their hangovers feel. They are physical embodiments of the era of fame and excess, but additionally they act as audience inserts into the real and horrifying story of Sharon Tate, which Tarantino weaves into the background with a great performance of innocent Hollywood love and kindness from Robbie. Perhaps most impressively is the fact that the story of Rick Dalton and Sharon Tate intertwine so seamlessly and despite its almost three hour runtime the movie never real drags or speeds to its conclusion. The construction is not as unique as some of his other works but it manages to feel fresh for a director so established, which really did impress me.So we have this movie made about this nostalgic yet dangerous time in Californian history in the actual style of a nostalgic and warm movie from that era. It's a 60s Hollywood movie about Hollywood from the perspective of a fan living in 2019 if you will. It feels like an all too familiar dreamland, on the edge of parody, and as such it achieves some truly humorous moments with a little biting social commentary sprinkled in. And in old Hollywood fashion by the end of the film the heroes are heroes and the heavies are the heavies. Absent violence it is not, but it does not indulge to the fanatical excesses of his previous work. It is markedly mature. I anticipated a far more gory and dark ending, a possible condemnation of the romanticized Hollywood of the past, but it ended far more subtly (and in my opinion properly). The final scene had me on the edge of my seat and then in stitches and was probably my favorite in the whole film.DiCaprio and Pitt are just perfectly cast. I cannot think of a single criticism of there work here. In particular the scenes where DiCaprio plays Dalton playing a villain on the set of a western impressed me greatly. Not that he needs validation from me but he is a real talent. I am also not sure how anyone could doubt the ability of Robbie at this point in her career, here she gives a life to the role of Sharon Tate that was sorely needed. It added gravity and a sense of stakes to the ending sequence. And what can I say about Pitt, he oozes cool to the point where you actually believe he could kick Bruce Lee's ass.With Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Tarantino has solidified his already towering mark on modern film, while at the same time sending a love letter to the Hollywood of yesteryear, the town that has given him so much. Like Tate in the theater watching her own movie, you can feel the joy and love he gets from working on his craft, and that passion has garnered his movies rightful praise. I love Los Angeles, I love the movies, and I love this one in particular, it's far from flawless but in my eyes it is a 10/10.", "he has no idea of TV history": "First off the film was a total bore, one hour too long, the scenes of filming the TV shows were absolute rubbish and really boring, we are supposed to see scenes being shot, yet they are cut as in a finished film, what would happend is you would shoot the scene from one camera one angle, cut and go to the next it would not be edited till the end, the violence shown in the TV shows just would not be there at that time, you would not see any blood. he shows the spaghetti westerns in 4x3 academy ration they would have all been in Scope/panavision wide screen. Next Sharon Tate has no real reason to be in the film, as in the sordid boring \"fairy Tale\", the gang end up in the house net door . as for the dialogue yet again his fans are taken by really what is flat, boring not in the slightest bit witty or funny. I was hoping to like it, but there was so much wrong in the film and as many have mentioned before no plot or any character development at all. just meandering set pieces that go no where", "One of the most ambitious and brilliantly made love letters to an important era of movie making and an instant classic from such a fantastic filmmaker.": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the ninth film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, it is one of the most ambitious and brilliantly made love letters to an important era of movie making and an instant classic from such a fantastic filmmaker.In 1969, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), once one of the biggest Western actors on TV, struggles to find work in Hollywood. As Rick laments his fading fame, his best friend and stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) also deals with his own problems as a result of apparent rumours of him murdering his wife. One day, Rick manages to land a role in a new Western series called \"Lancer\", and while he attempts to impress the director with his acting abilities, Cliff is meanwhile uncovering some unsettling information about a group of hippies squatting at the compound of his old workplace.As fascinating as it is engaging, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves that nine films in, Tarantino can still amaze us with his unique style of storytelling and personal perspective of the world around him. His vast cinephilic knowledge frequently shines through as we see him check off just about every Hollywood trope without ever resorting to typical cliches. In addition to this, the ways in which Tarantino immerses his audience in the free-spirited era of 1960s America is a sight to behold. His choice of soundtrack, the witty dialogue, the clever use of cinematography, and even the special effects of inserting modern actors into films of that time (similar to Forrest Gump) felt seamlessly accomplished. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are in perfect sync with each other, being that they are both actor and stuntman respectively, so much so that it is virtually impossible to come to a conclusion as to who gave a better performance. Margot Robbie is worth noting as well as Sharon Tate, the young actress married to director Roman Polanski who was also struggling to be taken seriously in Hollywood. Her portrayal is respectful and thankfully Tate's real-life fate is not used for cheap entertainment thrills. This film is a must-see not only for Tarantino fans but also for anyone with an undying appreciation of cinema in general, much like Tarantino himself.I rate it a very high 9.5/10", "The appeal of Quentin Tarantino: a tale of triangular fetishism...": "\"We\" all anticipate the next Tarantino movie, like Scorsese and not so long ago Woody Allen. A Tarantino film is an event by itself: casting, trailers, ads, interviews attract us like candies to window-shopping eyes and our reaction is always the same \"it's gonna be great\".Who's \"we\"? Maybe a generic term for movie fans who respect directors that don't try to make tear-jerkers, crowd-pleasers or Academy boot-kissers, Tarantino makes the movies HE likes and that's his trick: he belongs to a certain breed of directors who make their fans believe they also belong to a certain breed of \"connaisseurs\", an auteur without the pompous undertones. And the more polarizing he gets, the more exhilarating it is to belong to that little team of aficionados.But why do \"we\" dig a director whose chief inspiration is camp and nostalgia?Think about it, most of us appreciate good films, adore masterpieces and enjoy a few guilty pleasures, but if we had a choice between a Wilder or a Hitchcock classic and some badly-dubbed Kung Fu film or random sexploitation flick directed by an Italian named Steven, we'll probably stick to our guns and opt for quality... the \"rep\" is important, the rating too (we're on IMDb after all) and our time is too precious to care for celluloid trash no matter the nostalgic value... yet this trash was precious to QT, and because of that personal value and the way it made possible masterpieces like \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Kill Bill\" (I wasn't a fan of \"Basterds\" and \"Django\"), we connect them to a greatness they didn't have.The result is simple: any B-movie made by QT is regarded as a sort of \"Ed Wood\"-like masterpiece, it's like the tools became the art, once he defined his skills and style -which were truly revolutionary- and became successful, the less he felt the need to revisit his art.\nAt the end, we don't love his films as much as the way they speak about what HE loves, the story doesn't matter when style is doing the storytelling.And \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is pure 1969 style, a pivotal year for \"New Hollywood\" fans and those who're familiar with either the book or documentary \"Easy Riders and Raging Bulls\". It's also another occasion for QT to remind us of the movies, the TV programs, the era he grew up with and even a non-expert fan will appreciate the love-letter. But that's the catch for me, the film was enjoyable to the extent that it kept making connections with its era.Rick Dalton, played by Leo Di Caprio was consistently inserted in fictional or existing shows where he played the heavy-who-always-loses, his struggles to give a fine start to his career was in line with the evolution of Hollywood and made for a great character's arc. Cliff Booth, the stunt double, played by Brad Pitt is like a macho version of his Chanel counterpart but I couldn't resist his confrontation with Bruce Lee, played by a scene-stealing Mike Moh.As Sharon Tate, Margot Robbie has a touching moment where she smiles at the screen-performance of her real-life counterpart and she inspires a terrific cameo with Steve Mc Queen (Damian Lewis).Those scenes are great because they do put us in the mood of then-Hollywood, but whenever we're stuck with fictional characters, the charm is lost, temporarily.That's the problem when the story matters less than the cover, especially when the cover is Hollywood's history and the way Charles Manson put an end to its all-rainbow-and-flowers state of grace. But that's what makes the experience very particular. The horrific details of Tate's savage murder are still haunting me, I remember the aftermath interview of Polanski and how he insisted on Sharon never doing drugs or alcohol... so I was wondering how a film that involves the massacre of an innocent pregnant woman be tagged a comedy...I watched it with the same dread as \"In Cold Blood\" and the generally lighthearted mood and the overplayed sweetness of Tate felt unsettling if not obscene.But that's underestimating Tarantino who understood perfectly that he couldn't capitalize on such an event, and that it needed a revisionist take. It's the smart move for three reasons:First, we hate the Manson killers so much that the violence that explode at the end had the good old Tarantinesque cathartic feel, and boy, did the climax feel good!Secondly, it confronts the two \"heroes\" to reality again and that's where they're at their best.Finally, it ties the plot together and gives its full meaning to the Pacino character who insisted that in Hollywood, the hero always wins. which is precisely why the film ends that way. The irony of Hollywood being that if life happened like in Hollywood movie, Tate would still be alive. \"Once Upon a Time\"... like in a Hollywood fairy tale. Style does the storytelling and QT isn't just one hell of a writer/director, even his directing tells stories.And I thought Al didn't have an important role, he basically makes the film's statement. Leo and Brad have enough scenes to even garner a few nominations... and all Robbie did was irradiating her sweetness, making Tate a sort of overarching angel on that telegenic mess (a tactful touch).I only regret a few moments that seem to beg for a Sound Editing Oscar nomination, fillers made of driving, smoking, feeding etc. Giving more value than needed to insignificant or inconsequent material wouldn't make \"us\" fans of QT but fetishists. Maybe a response to his own fetishism for old movies? Still, and this comes from someone who shares \"that\" fetishism, QT should lay off the foot thing, it's turning to an obsession.Or maybe our love for QT is a metaphor for his own foot fetishism, this is a guy who enjoy campy \"stinkers\", but if he ever made some, would we tell?In fact, does it ever stink with QT?", "A One of a Kind Fairytale": "Once Upon a Time in the West, Quentin Tarantino's newest film is both his most mature film to date, yet it's also him at his most indulgent. This movie is unrestrained in what it's trying to achieve, which is to write a love letter to a very specific time in Hollywood history and to a very specific type of actor in Hollywood history. It's a movie about changing times and the death of an era, which also works in a way as a kind of 'meta' commentary on the state of film today.This movie is about, well, I wouldn't be too inclined to say that it's about any one thing in particular, other than painting a picture of late 1960's Hollywood and the people who were a part of it. However, at the forefront there's Rick Dalton, played by Leo, who's the very specific type of actor I alluded to earlier and his stunt double, Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt. Dalton's character is a stuttering smoking alcoholic, who finds himself feeling more and more useless as things start to change in the world around him. He starts to realize, very early on in the film, that the kind of characters he plays, which are basically the bad guys in Western TV shows that serves as the guy who gets killed or gets his ass kicked by the hero at the end of the episode. And he realizes that his career may be in for some rough patches in the future. On the other hand, Booth, is more of a laid-back character, kind of like \"The Dude\", someone who doesn't really worry too much about anything, but just goes with the flow of things.As expected, the performances by not just Leo and Pitt are phenomenal here, but pretty much everyone involved with this film is great. Pacino shows up and has some standout moments on screen, Dakota Fanning, and every performance here is great. There's a little girl who plays an actress in the film, and she was also fantastic. Great casting and acting overall. Let's talk about Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate for a second here because she's in the movie, but she doesn't really have much to do here. Of course, in real life, Sharon Tate was horrifically murdered and perhaps Tarantino wanted to include her in here for a couple of reasons, maybe #1 to honour her memory and #2 as a kind of set up for the ending. For those of us who knew her terrible fate at the hands of some of the members of the Manson family, the final act of the movie is almost told like a crime show with Kurt Russell narrating the events of the night. And it is a crime retelling, expect the ending here is very much like the ending of Inglourious Basterds, where it's a rewriting of history. But it seems that Sharon Tate's character is in the movie solely for this ending, because she really doesn't do much in the film and has very minimal dialogue. Margot Robbie is good here with what she's given, though.The movie jumps back and forth between situations, much like Pulp Fiction, but I think that movie is more about great dialogue and situations that in some way or another bring all of the characters together in the end. Here, I think the focus was more on painting a portrait of 1960's Hollywood. And in doing that, this movie is a success. The set designs, the extras, making L.A. seem like it's 50 years ago, it looks real and Tarantino did a wonderful job at recreating this particular time in film and TV history. And I think that this movie is definitely Tarantino at his most mature, and has the most command over what he's trying to show us and make us feel. If you just go along for the ride, without complaining too much about the lack of a definitive structure, I think the situations presented here are wonderful and compelling, even though there is a noticeable lack of tension throughout the film, except for the one scene where Brad Pitt goes to the Manson Ranch, which is one of the best scenes in the movie and the final act, which is phenomenal. And I think this lack of tension would be a detriment in a more conventional movie, but this really is more of a hang-out movie, akin to the likes of a Big Lebowski or I've even heard one comparison made to Seinfeld. Because this movie isn't about anything in particular, other than painting this picture of this era.This movie will of course, draw the attention of many people and it will be divisive, not just for the ending, but because overall lack of structure in the film. Like I said, Tarantino is at his most mature here, but his childish excitement and love for film is extremely apparent here and I do think this is his most \"Tarantino\" movie to date, it seems like he made the movie entirely for himself. And I don't think this is a bad thing. His movies are always original, different and I truly hope he doesn't stop at 10 films, because he's one of the very few original voices left in big budget movies that aren't sequels, remakes or reboots. Sometimes this film does feel like he goes a bit too far in certain directions with his \"Tarantino-isms\". But I would not want it any other way. This is an artist, and film is his way of expressing his art. And even if it's not perfect, often overblown and unrestrained, I do believe Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, in due time, will go down as the director's flawed masterpiece.Mike Stoklasa, from his Half in the Bag review, mentioned that this movie was #2 at the box office on its opening weekend, second only to a movie you've already seen before, starring CGI lions, which is quite literally (pretty much) the same movie you've seen before, and even though this movie has a bunch of A-listers and it's directed by one of the biggest Hollywood directors of all time, the vast majority of the public respond to blind nostalgia. It's a clear sign that the times have changed. Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, even if Tarantino intended it or not, may prove to be very relevant to today's film industry, in the sense of the end of an era. Some people called Sharon Tate's death the \"symbolic death of the 60's,'' representing a kind of death of innocence in the American public. She survives in this film and perhaps Tarantino's message is one of hope. The ending of the film, feels quite literally like the ending of a fairy tale, with the font you would use on a Cinderella storybook. Hopefully, in this politically correct world we live in today, there will still be a spot for filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, someone who will simply make his movie without holding back, disregarding any type of pandering to any kind of social group, so that film lovers like myself, can enjoy it in all its glory.", "Another work of art from the master": "Tarantino always delivers withe masterpieces and OUATIH is no exception to that. Everything about this film from the casting, to the sets, to the jokes, and especially the stunt work is beautiful. Tarantino films remind us what it means to love cinema. Go see this movie as soon as possible.", "Thank You Quentin": "Thank You Quentin Tarantino For this Love Letter to all that is Hollywood, You Never Disappoint, I enjoyed Every Second of it and i didn't want it to end.\nA perfect 5/5 and if i had to Rank all Tarantino Films this would be Ranked 4th after ( Pulp Fiction - Reservoir Dogs & Django Unchained )\nAnyway i will watch this movie again and again and again and again.... I loved it that much.", "Slow but great": "Another time Tarantino delivered a very good movie along with stunning performances from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.\nI understand if that movie isn't for everyone because of the slow speed it has.\nBut I really loved every car drive scene in this movie.\nAspecially the brutal and funny ending was a classic Tarantino.", "Not for everyone but Happy I get it.": "OAT...IH was such a deep and intriguing movie. I give it a 10/10 but I get why some people would give it a low score.\nTo appreciate this movie you probably need some knowledge of Hollywood in '69 and '69 America. There is references that span the whole era. Having empathy for all the characters helps too. Something that is easily provided to you. The Manson Family storyline was just amazing and so glad Tarantino approaches it the way he did.\nFor me Margot Robbie captured the essence of the true meaning of the movie and the Hollywood dream which sadly in real life became a nightmare for her. She was able to protray Sharon Tate in her actions and demeanour beautifully. Deserves a whole lot of credit for this. Oscar winning credit !!!\nI kind of feel people giving this bad reviews kind of wanted the TRUE story ending. And if this is true for you, well you really need to take a long look at yourself. If you want to see that just switch on the news. It happens all the time with mass shootings, were if there was a hero that stopped them, you'd never know. Life is still not set in Hollywood and happy endings sadly don't always exist.", "Best since Inglourious Basterds": "Quentin Tarantino has delivered once again. Everything about this movie was just brilliant. The dialogue was classic Tarantino, the direction was impeccable, and the performances were all around phenomenal. It is consistently entertaining on every level. That final act was especially exciting, and honestly moved me in a way that I didn't expect. It gave a whole new meaning to the title, and really elevated the film. Easily Tarantino's best since Inglourious Basterds, and for my money, an instant classic. I was truly floored by it. A movie about movies made by a man who clearly loves film more than anybody. How could it have been anything but a masterpiece?10/10", "Quentin deserves his popular esteem": "His ability to tell a story is true talent and I enjoy watching his movies a lot. This one was slow moving and non dramatic for the first three quarters, but just gave me time to get to know the characters. There were scenes like following Cliff back home after his days work and being greeted by his lovely dog. This gave his character a sense of loneliness and mystery. I'm so bored of the same old copy and paste movies nowadays, this movie took a bit of concentration but the last 40 minutes were exciting, thrilling and funny.", "Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood Film Review - Quentin Tarantino Directs His 9th Symphony With Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt & Margot Robbie In A Story That Might Have Been": "If we could change time then Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood is the 160 minute fairytale about what really happened in the Hollywood Hills one summer night in 1969. With Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, a stammering cowboy on the set of a tv series called Bounty Law, the one that isn't Bonanza, and his stunt double Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth. Cliff is not doing so much stunt work, but mainly driving Rick around, since he lost his license for being DUI. And although Rick's popular, he's getting to the end of his tv cowboy career with his show just being cancelled. Maybe he should try Italian cowboy films suggests Al Pacino as producer Marvin Schwarz. But Rick's not ready to eat spaghetti yet. Not with Pilot season coming up. But Marvin Schwarz and his wife love Rick and he's really keen for him to consider it. He can only take so many punches as the fall guy. Maybe that should be Cliff?Back at home high up the Hollywood Hills, Rick glimpses his new neighbours he's never seen. Only the hit director of Rosemary's Baby; Roman Polanski, and new wife Sharon Tate. And we know the countdown has started to what is coming in this loving pastiche to razzle dazzle Hollywood. Tarantino takes the faded backlots of the late 1960's Hollywood movie sets and mixes them with stunning cinematography by Robert Richardson. Filming shots at the real spots that Sharon visited and adding a flavour of Taco Bell to the Hollywood Boulevard set.Cliff drops off Rick and his nice car, to work on his lines, I love Rick's way of working (!), and drives his own wreck to his home on the wrong side of the tracks. A trailer with his well trained dog Brandy. Cliff may have got away with murder in Hollywood, did he or didn't he (?), but he's certainly not living the high life. Although he seems like he's just doing fine, and Brad is looking pretty damn good.Margot Robbie is on fire as Sharon, arriving on a Pan-Am flight, just like her character in the cancelled tv programme of the same name. I thought it was great. She was an air-stewardess, but here she's flying first as the sweet young actress who one day goes to watch herself in her latest movie. Looking around, just in case, before she puts her glasses on. But loving the audience's reactions to her klutzy character. The costumes throughout by Arianne Phillips nail the era's vibes with Brad's Hawaiian shirt, he's so cool, and Rick's wanna-be leading man in his tan leather jacket. And Margot's costumes are amazing, that black polo and white mini skirt and boots will have a fashion moment.And while Rick and Cliff are drinking and slowly sliding into has-beens, Sharon; Hollywood's latest new young thing, is living the high life, partying with the Mamas and the Papas and other celebs at The Playboy Mansion. The music is a highlight and Damian Lewis an almost unrecognisable Steve McQueen giving his opinion of Sharon and her marriage to Roman. She has a bright future ahead of her in the Hollywood studio system. And when the choreographed lights get switched on at twilight in Tinseltown, the stars come out to play. Cliff would dearly love to be included in their circle.But in those Hollywood Hills are also a feral family of hippies, they need to go to Vietnam (!), instead scavenging in bins for LA's left over food, and led by the infamous Charles Manson. Cliff and Rick see them around town, we only catch Manson himself in one scene, skulking around at the Polanski home. But Pussycat catches Cliff's eye. Margaret Qualley, who recently played an exquisite Ann Reinking in the delicious Fosse/Verdon, is the underage temptress. Look out for her highly arched ballet feet! But Cliff's too smart to get caught out. And drops her home at the old western ranch where they filmed Bounty Law. Here the 'family' are living, and he's the stranger in town. But he makes it clear that he wants to look in on the owner, played by Bruce Dern, to make sure he's okay. Cliff can still kick a door down if he needs to, and Dakota Fanning is a particularly nasty Squeky. But she can read how a scene would otherwise play out, as she lets him in.And when Rick lands a role with Kurt Russell as stunt co-ordinator, he takes on Cliff as a favour to Rick. Much has been made of the scene with Mike Moh's Bruce Lee. I did read that Bruce was criticised for being too hard on his stuntmen. Well rightly or wrongly Cliff evens the score, but gets fired for his services to stuntmen everywhere. But don't worry, Rick has a DIY job for him. Shirtless with a tool belt, are you kidding Quentin? Brad's still got it.And Rick is still landing parts in pilots and gets a prized Sam Wanamaker gig. Meeting his young co-star Trudi, played by Julia Butters, he describes the book he is reading to her in one of the films most tender moments. But when he fluffs his lines in Lancer he really takes it out on himself, did he break a mirror or was that my imagination?, but being hungover is no illusion. He knows he needs to quit. And when he nails the shoot with Trudi, they are fantastic, well he's still got a part in an FBI themed pilot screening tonight. And of course Marvin loves it and it's a spaghetti dinner all round.And while Rick and Cliff are in Italy making westerns, Sharon has been feeling uncomfortably pregnant in LA. Husband Roman is away filming and she has her friends over on this hottest day of the year. The day Cliff and Rick fly back home with Rick's new Italian wife. This is getting tense, we all know Tarantino's on screen violence. And while Cliff is smoking an acid trip while walking Brandy, Rick is making a frozen margarita and his wife played by Lorenza Izzo is sleeping off the jet lag; a dark car creeps up the Hills towards Sharon.You can do all you like about the violence in Tarantino's films, I'm sure there's more violence in the gaming industry where you pull the trigger, and critic Caspar Salmon at The Guardian really got his knickers in a twist about the ending! His review is a real spoiler so don't read if you haven't seen the film yet. But for me Hollywood is Tarantino's best. With the greatest and most well deserved violence. An amazing cast with a host of guest cameos and plenty of parts for the children of Hollywood's celebrities, Once Upon A Time is the fairytale I want to remember. It has comedy and pathos in equal measure. Brad and Leonardo are a delicious double act both at the top of their game, did Margot Robbie have less lines? Did I notice? No, because with Tarantino her Sharon Tate was luminous and the role to remember.Tarantino's 9th Symphony will be remembered as his masterpiece, a fabulous love story to Sharon Tate and Hollywood.", "Tarantino retells Hollywood, film, and TV revives history like no one can.": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was an amazing trip for baby-boomers - taking us back to when television was loaded with westerns and western TV stars, cigarette commercials, big cars, white go-go boots, and names bandied around some of us haven't heard in years. And the shows: Hootnanny, Mannix, the FBI.And it's great to see some Hollywood celebrities -Mama Cass (Rachel Redleaf), Michelle Phillips (Rebecca Rittenhouse), Steve McQueen (Damien Lewis), James Stacy (Timothy Olyphant), Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry), Bruce Lee (Mike Moh), Connie Stevens (Dreama Walker).It was not so great given their fates, but there were some other familiar names too: Jay Sebring, (Emile Hirsch), Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson), Voytek Frykowski (Costa Ronin), and Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning).Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt star as series actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double, Cliff Booth. Booth isn't living the LA high life - far from it - and does part-time stunt work these days and basically acts as Rick's gofer.Rick lives, as it turns out, on Cielo Drive, right next Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha).Tarantino has the Manson story down pat - Manson coming to look for Terry Melcher, Doris Day's son, because a proposed record deal never materialized. Sharon's pregnancy, weekend guests, the visit to El Coyote, even sitting at the right table (I've been there hundreds of times), and it did look like they actually filmed inside.It was also fun to see Musso & Frank's Grill.Rick Dalton, whose career is losing ground due to his alcoholism, makes an appearance on \"Lancer,\" directed by Sam Waterston (Nicholas Hammond). Wanamaker, the original George in Virginia Woolf, did indeed do a lot of television directing.Rick's time on Lancer is juxtaposed with Sharon going to see herself in a film, The Wrecking Crew. We see her young, beautiful, and happy.I admit here that I felt the \"Lancer\" section was way too long, but part of that could be because I wasn't feeling that well during that time. It did show Rick determined to do a good job. The entire scene represents a wonderful tour de force for DiCaprio.After a nostalgic and sometimes amusing wind-up, Tarantino goes into full Tarantino mode in the last forty minutes or so. Also stay through the credits; the movie doesn't end where you think it does.So Tarantino in a way heals this beloved era and a time in Hollywood where everything was beginning to be in flux - western stars making films in Italy and Spain, the detective show taking the place of westerns, and events in the air that would change Hollywood forever.Pitt and DiCaprio are dynamite together, DiCaprio, drunk, sad, but a man who can still act. Pitt is cool and takes life as it comes.Another standout for me was Damien Lewis as Steve McQueen. The man's amazing.However, the film is loaded with vignettes and memories in the corners of our minds as the song says, that if you're a boomer, you can't not love. It was the summer of love, it was a prelude to a much more somber time. For the non-boomers, there are DiCaprio and Pitt doing what they do best - being movie stars.", "AMAZING - Not self indulgent - ignore that idea": "I saw the first showing on day of release (tradition) and yes I saw Jackie Brown on Christmas Day. I am a fan but can call a spade a spade.... if a movie sucks I'll admit it. This film is incredible. Actors under the direction of QT are just incredible. QT can turn big movie stars in his films into real people.... this in itself is a major accomplishment. I would assume this comes from total trust in your director.From start to finish this move fleshes out who these people are and it's a pleasure to watch. People Love to say QT is self indulgent - I believe his love for film transcends that idea and he's actually just giving us the best movie he can. I have not stopped thinking about this film since Friday. His films get better with each viewing and this one will surely be included.We just don't get films made with this degree of skill everyday. QT is def in the league of the LegendsAll I can say this movie won't be fully appreciated til some point in the future. Not going to babble on. This film is AMAZING.", "A Different Perspective": "The Manson murders signaled a loss of innocence in America, so it is surprising to see that sense of innocence caught on film in Tarantino's movie. Those who were alive in Los Angeles in the sixties will tell you he did an amazing job capturing the \"vibe.\" Made me want to relive that era where everything was loose, free and easy. You can't judge this movie by traditional narrative standards as I don't think that was the point. After sitting through the surprise ending, I left the theater thinking \"What would this country look like today if that had been the case?\" I can only imagine.", "Tarantino capitalizes on his goldmine of talent": "Definitely coulda shaved 15-20 minutes off, but I'll let it slide cuz this was clearly a Tarantino passionate project (even moreso than his others). I can't imagine Leo not winning every award come award season, and Brad was as phenomenal as ever. I would've liked to see more of Margot Robbie, but even in her disappointingly limited screentime she literally and figuratively shined. Overall, it's definitely one of the better movies I've seen in a very long time, and even if it's runtime was exhaustive the ending made everything worth it and more.", "Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood (2019)": "Directed by Quentin Tarantino. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Al Pacino, Margaret Qualley, Emile Hirsch, Timothy Olyphant, Julia Butters, Kurt Russell, Nicholas Hammond, Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Mike Moh, Luke Perry, Bruce Dern, Lorenza Izzo, Damian Lewis, Kate Berlant. (R)Movie star on the decline, Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), and his best friend and stunt double, Cliff (Pitt), navigate a late-60s Hollywood that has left them behind and is barely even recognizable anymore; Dalton also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Robbie) while the Spahn Movie Ranch is becoming overrun with squatters under the spell of evil Charlie Manson. Director Tarantino's fetishes are on full display here (pop culture references, explosions of graphic violence, camera lingering on bare feet, etc.), but so is his mastery of storytelling, of the rhythm of dialogue, crisp and vibrant direction, and in encouraging great acting across the entire (large) cast. Those performances, particularly from DiCaprio and Pitt at the top of both of their games, aid in carrying the audience over some uneven pacing in the midsection and retrieving focus when the narrative outskirts start to ramble. An intriguing curveball in the Tarantino oeuvre: rather than capping off long, suspenseful scenes with the catharsis of sudden bloodshed, he more often than not lets the dread build and build and then hiss out like air from a balloon as the scene moves on; squirms of discomfort rather than laughs or screams for release. The unorthodox climax is bound to puzzle, infuriate, excite, divide, but whatever one thinks of it, how else was Tarantino going to send us off, and would any other director have dared to do the same?89/100", "Tarentino at his best": "It's just like Quentin to add his recognized touch of misleading the public to a new level. Much like Inglorious Basterds where hitler died in a theater fire does manson's crew meet a fate worse than death when they tried to kill Sharon Tate and her company of friends. Although any one of us who were born before 1969 know that this story was only semi-fictional. Manson's crew did kill Sharon, Abigail Folger and the rest including the La Bianca couple a few days after. Yet the question to all of this, is 'What If\" Many who saw this film had to ask that it might have been a mistake on Manson's part of picking the wrong house or at least his crew did, which resulted in their grossly and untimely demise at the hands of the stunt double (Pitt) and of course his boss Dalton (DiCaprio) who saved everyone by silent proxy with their blue collar attitudes.I really enjoyed this take on the manson case as it was the most horrific event during the tumultuous sixties while the vietnam war was going on. Tarantino did get one part right, that Sadie did leave before the assassination was to start. That much is certain. But to see Squeaky fromme, Leslie Van Houten and Steve Grogan get mauled, clubbed, stabbed, nearly castrated by a dog, and blown torched was icing on the proverbial cake. Again it's the idea of \"What If?\" Both DiCaprio and Pitt were amazing together as struggling scamps of hollywood during its evolutionary period of censorship, and many cases of discrimination against those who changed an industry. Since manson's death in prison there had been talks about who was to direct his life story. The only other movie that had in depth details about his life and his family was a film called Helter Skelter and manson's portrayal played by Steve Railsback. Who had numerous nominations applied in his honor. Yet it is still a very sensitive subject for surviving family members to this day. Especially for Polanski and the Folger company. However I am sure that Quentin will come up with a new project and wow the audiences again with the same question as to - \"What If?\"", "Ho-hum Hollywood Hokum": "'Once Upon a Time . . .' continues Tarantino's decline as a writer and director, although the principal weakness of his latest film is a rambling screenplay which develops neither story nor characters. Set in LA at the time of the notorious Manson Family killings, the relationship between fading alcoholic TV star Rick, and his long-time stunt double Cliff takes center stage. Unfortunately neither man has much personality, the pair share a tired connection and their exchanges never hint at the electricity between Vincent and Jules in 'Pulp Fiction', or Louis and Ordell in 'Jackie Brown'.The movie looks decent enough, but oodles of time is wasted venerating the trashy films and TV shows of that era. There's an endless passage where Rick delivers some routine over-acting as a cowboy villain in a formulaic TV pilot, inter-cut with Sharon Tate visiting a cinema to watch a spoof spy movie in which she had a minor role. Voice-overs laboriously explain the narrative gaps as more than a hundred minutes are spent on a procession of scenes which do little more than provide background. Eventually, the ghostly apparition of an actual story emerges after Cliff gives one of Manson's hippie runaways a ride to the derelict movie ranch where the 'Family' were residing. The ensuing confrontation shows the potential of Tarantino's idea - but he loses the plot again in order to pay homage to spaghetti westerns.The 'action' finally arrives at an overblown climax which gives Tarantino yet another opportunity to show off his chops as a director of theatrical violence. He gives reality a fairy tale tweak in this last act, but it's hard to think of the film as anything more than self-indulgent fluff.", "Solid": "Quntin done it again ! A great movie, maintain the same rythm from the beginning till the end with a great heartwarming and bittersweet ending! Brad deserves an Oscar for that role for sure and leo performance was as always top level.", "Having seen this movie when it was first released and then watching it again months later.": "On first viewing I thought to myself this is not bad. I thought Brad Pitt would win an Oscar and he did. The second viewing blew me away, so much better second time around. How Leonardo did not win an Oscar I don't know.", "Adding to my previous film review...": "I just returned home now after seeing \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" Wow! What an exceptionally well made film all around! I have seen all of Tarantino's films, except his most recent, which received mixed critical reviews. Tarantino does a revenge fantasy film here with his trademark dark humor and hysterical humor. Exceptionally good acting performances from Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt. Tarsntino knows the facts of Hollywodd of 1969 and the infamous Manson family murders and plays around with them to great effect. One of Tarantino's best ever films.", "A happy ending... not what I expected": "What a fantastic movie... I absolutely loved it. You already know most of the story from history ... the best part was listening to Damian Lewis's monologue on Sharon Tate- Roman Polanski and Jay Sebring. Playing as Steve McQueen .. which was so spot on it was making me belt out in laughter. Perfect McQueen. Loved the new ending Leo and Brad are perfect together.Instantly made top 3 best Q.T. All time. But it's hard to knock Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fictiin from the top of the podium.", "Thank you, QT": "In the painful world of Liberal media,remakes,reboots and unoriginal films,\nQuentin Tarantino has brought us another masterpiece\n\"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\"", "Once Upon A Time in Hollywood film review": "Director: Quentin Tarantino\nWriter: Quentin Tarantino\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Al Pacino\nNarrator: Kurt Russell\nA bold preamble flashes up on screen announcing Quentin Tarantino's ninth film. It's a stark reminder that Tarantino is competing with his own legacy. Can anything truly match the sheer brilliance of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction?First cuts are often the deepest, but Once Upon a Time in Hollywood comfortably reaches the bar set so unreasonably high.His customary attention to detail is forensic as 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, film is used to frame a story set in 1969. Fictional characters are cleverly set against true events as they mingle with real people in a concurrent storyline.Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a jobbing TV actor who fears the big movie roles have passed him by. He is consoled by Bounty Law; a long running Western where he plays the grizzled bad guy. Faithful wingman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is Rick's stunt double, best friend and confidante. Back in Beverley Hills Rick has new neighbors. Impossibly beautiful actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) has moved in with husband Roman Polanski. Rick is excited by the prospect and could be one pool party away from starring in a Polanski movie. If only he could actually meet them. Meanwhile, producer Harvey Schwarz (Al Pacino) is convinced he can reignite Rick's career with a spaghetti western. Interestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn't play to the audience the way I thought it would. It wasn't a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected.There are many pleasures to be found in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" but Tarantino's interest in replicating Los Angeles in 1969 is worth the price of admission alone. It's enough to find period cars and costumes, but Tarantino goes above and beyond, filling backgrounds with detailed signage and theater marquees, redressed buildings, and packing the radio with advertisements and glorious rock hits to set the mood. Tech credits are downright miraculous, securing the time machine nature of the feature, with Tarantino as much in love with his layered frames as he is with the characters, working diligently to take away the modern world. There's enough going on around the action in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" to warrant multiple viewings, just to see the hospital corners Tarantino achieves when resurrecting the end of an era. Very impressive .DiCaprio proves to be such a perfect choice for Dalton that one can't really imagine anyone else in the part. It's one of his best performances, although he's arguably topped by a fantastic Pitt, that reminds viewers how wonderful he can be in the right material. Margot Robbie, was fabulous as Sharon Tate with her effervescent personality. Margaret Qualley, as SuperPuss was a standout.It's a glorious fusion of genres; part western, buddy movie and homage to popular culture in the 1960s. Stylish and visually stunning, it bears the classic hallmarks of a Tarantino film. Maddening tangents, delightful cameos and set pieces all provide a compulsive mixture. The cinematography, the writing, the casting, the soundtrack, all flawless. This is a superior film and sits comfortably in my top three Tarantino films. 10/10.", "A marvelous collection of all of Tarantino's storytelling strengths": "With my movie watching habits, I'm more than used to long scenes that don't push the plot forward instead focusing on a character, and Tarantino's new film is full of them. There's one in particular that comes roughly halfway through the film as Leonardo Dicaprio's Rick Dalton has come out of his trailer on the western television show he's guest starring on. He sits down to a young actress reading a biography of Walt Disney. Dalton pulls out a pulp western novel and explains the plot to the girl. It's about an old cowboy, probably past his prime, who's having trouble in his day to day. The story obviously hits Dalton hard and he ends up in tears with the girl consoling him.This scene takes its time, and it's actually a fantastic moment in a couple of ways. First of all, there's the obvious subtext that Dalton nearly directly addresses about how the novel mirrors his own life and feelings of his own future. The other subtext is about the choice in reading material. The girl is reading something high and lofty, a biography of a famous (great?) man. The book is large, bound beautifully, and pristine. Dalton's book is small with red edges to the paper indicating its cheapness, and is about a nobody. This is Tarantino saying why he love the pulpy stuff he loves. It's all about the little man and their problems, not the lofty ideals of giants.The sophistication of the storytelling goes well beyond the structure of individual scenes, though. There's something really fascinating going on in what is essentially a triple narrative. First is Dalton, acting and trying to get his former success back one guest spot at a time. The second centers on Cliff Booth, Dalton's stunt man/gopher, as he takes a day off and gets dangerously close to the Manson gang. The third is about Sharon Tate as she touches on her incipient level of fame. All together, the movie really is a fairy tale of making it in Hollywood, and all three storylines feed it.The two storylines between Dalton and Booth are the meat of the film, taking up the most screen time. Dalton is off playing the heavy on television, but Booth is out acting as the heavy in a real life encounter with a murderous gang. Dalton is happily ensconced in his world of fantasy while his stunt man takes the car out to the Stahl Ranch and actually punches a Manson boy in the face while staring down the rest of the gang.It's a new movie, so I'm going to warn for spoilers now. Again, you're adults, no bolding.As the movie comes to an end and Dalton and Booth return from a six month sojourn in Italy making cheap Italian knockoffs of successful films (with Dalton's new Italian wife in tow), the Manson clan ends up at the Dalton house instead of the Tate house. Dalton is hiding out in his pool and the wife is asleep with jet lag. Booth is preparing his dog's meal of canned food when the three burst in. It's not the movie star who ends up fighting them off, it's his stunt double. Booth is the one who beats two of them to death and the third within an inch of her life after they start to make trouble. Dalton does get involved at the very end, but after Booth had done all the work. In addition, Dalton gets to contribute in the most showy, movie-star way possible, with a flamethrower. The stunt double does all the work, and the movie star gets the highlight and the credit.The third storyline plays through all of this as Sharon Tate goes to the movies to watch herself, she goes to the Playboy Mansion for a party, and generally seems superfluous, except she's vital. When the Manson clan decides to go after Dalton instead of her, she's obviously left alive and ends up inviting Dalton (but not Booth) up to join her little party already in progress.And here is where the fairy tale aspect really comes in. There's the obvious element of Sharon Tate surviving the night, but the underside of that is the implication that Dalton is going to now make it in Hollywood. He's gone to the right party for the first time in years. It didn't matter if he had a great guest spot on the western television show. No one outside of the set that day was ever going to notice him enough to give him the break he needed. It was by meeting Tate that he's going to become a movie actor again. It's an acknowledgment of how Hollywood actually works (contacts over talent) and a very nice way to wrap up Dalton's fairy tale story after he had vanquished the evil force (with some help, of course).The movie overall is very entertaining, looks as good as anything Tarantino has ever put out, and is filled with great writing and wonderful performances.", "Tarantino, revealed.": "To understand this movie you need to know history well, as well as Hollywood history, you need to love the movies, and to love fairy tales. The warning and disclaimer are right there in the title of the movie. If you don't check all the boxes you will not get this movie and you will hate it. But if you do get it, you will be right to leave the theater thinking this was one of Tarantino's masterpiecesAll these years we thought Quentin was going to saturate us with violence forever, but look at what a sentimental pacifist he turned out to be.Just like in Inglorious Basterds, where Tarantino gave the Third Reich what they deserved by machine-gunning them all down in a movie theater, so in this fairy tale he puts the world right again, as it should have been, but now he gives life instead of taking it.It's nearly impossible to justify one's opinion about this movie without offering spoilers, but I decided not to offer any. No spoilers here.Just know that if you are very familiar with Hollywood History and are a cinephile, if you know the details of the true story of one of this movie's characters, Sharon Tate, and if you like fairy tales, then you are going to absolutely love Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood and maybe even shed a happy tear in the final scene, like I did.The acting marks high points in the actors' careers. The direction is pure and matured Tarantino. The story and the ending, the blending of real-life and fictional characters and events, brilliant and perfectly delivered.", "Immersive": "A snap shot of a couple of people involved in Hollywood in 1969. One actor is Sharon Tate (Robbie), she lives with the hottest director in town and her career is sparking.Next door is an actor by the name of Rick Dalton (DiCaprio). He used to be a lead on TV, but his career is heading downhill and he is beginning to feel it.\nHis stunt double is also his best friend (Pitt), who has been pretty much blacklisted in Hollywood due to rumours about his personal life.The first hour 45 or so you are immersed in this world and follow the characters in their daily lives.\nThe film takes a dark turn as Pitts character picks up a hitch hiker who happens to be one of the Manson Family and things escalate from there.As the title suggests, this is a fairytale, set in a particular time in Hollywood and the events of the movie enhance this. Real people intermix with fictional characters and it is all very interesting even after viewing to put together what was real and what was not.There has been criticism of the lack of lines for Margot Robbie from some female critics. They seem to feel Tarantino should have shoe horned in more lines to 'improve' his film and to fit their agenda. I'm tired of this rubbish.. thankfully Tarantino does not need to be bullied and stoop to pandering to these idiots and will make the film he wants to make.Sharon Tate is presented on screen as he envisioned. As a happy young woman, whose career is going the right way. In a stand out scene, she joins an audience in a cinema to watch one of her own films. This part (without lines, just her reaction) is one of the highlights of the film.\nWhat I also like about this sequence is that the real Sharon Tate is also on screen, acting in comedic moments and some kick ass moments showing the world she was more than just a victim of the Manson Family.Another stand out scene for me was DiCaprio after a long sequence filming a part in a TV Western series, then blows his lines. Its so awkward and is followed by a total meltdown in his trailer. He then goes back and nails the performance. A little girl tells him its the best acting she has ever seen, which makes him very emotional.When the Manson Family show up at Cielo Drive, your heart begins to sink a little, knowing what is to come.However, this is a fairy tale set in Hollywood and perhaps there is still appetite in this cynical world for a Hollywood ending.", "The Best": "This film immediately became my favorite Tarantino movie. Margot Robbie, who plays Sharon Tate, expressed my sentiments exactly when she was interviewed by Harry Smith on NBC's Today show. She said that most people only remember Sharon Tate because of her savage murder by the scum that was the Manson Family and she wanted to show more of Sharon's life.\nAnd the movie does show us another side. She was a beautiful, innocent, and excited young woman who was realizing her dream that is held by tens of millions of other young women all over the world - becoming a world famous and admired movie star.\nHer memory deserves to honored this way and not just for her untimely death\nThe entire audience was laughing and cheering as Brad Pitt killed the characters of Tex Watson and Susan Atkins and Leonardo DiCaprio toasted Patricia Krenwinkel in the swimming pool. It was fiction, yes. But it was the way it should have been in real life and I think we all knew that deep down.\nThe only thing I would have added was Leonardo DiCaprio taking the flame thrower out to the Spahn Ranch and exterminating Charles Manson and the rest of the vermin out there who worshipped Manson and committed murder for him.", "Where dreams are made": "As I walked out the screening of Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" I felt a bit... confused. This is a film that is nothing more than an action-comedy fiasco so why did I enjoy it so much? There is no obvious technical answer besides Tarantino's knack for unpretentious bravado. With the commemoration of 50 years of Woodstock and its hippy culture, QT joined the celebrations in his own oddball way--giving praise to the factory of dreams that is Hollywood.As per Tarantino, the movie does not follow reality because reality is boring. For Quentin Tarantino, not using Hollywood for the purpose of fulfilling your fantasies is a waste of time. And so he does. Every frame is filled with posters, locations, logos, small businesses, big businesses of the time. So is the music. It's so condensed that it feels like a nostalgic playlist of which QT skips a track now and then. This is an era he only experienced from magazines and historical footage. This is for the better. It allows him to fill in the blanks with what he would've wished it were and in doing so, he added another stamp to his so-called cinematic universe.The plot revolves mostly around a faded TV actor, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as Rick struggles with your typical LA rich-boy midlife crisis. Despite having a luxurious villa, he is worried about time passing him by and he is stern even more when he finds out his neighbor is Roman Polanski--director of \"Rosemary's Baby\". As pleasing and over-the-top as DiCaprio's performance is (reminds me of his Jordan Belfort in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"), Brad Pitt's taciturn Cliff Booth wins my heart. Dalton treats him like a friend, but in the end, Cliff is still his helper and he is fine with that. He never hints at wanting something more, he suppresses any thoughts you might have about him being jealous or angry. He genuinely seems like a satisfied, serene, nice guy--more than you would expect from a Tarantino movie. Despite having his own affairs, Cliff always watches Rick's back.This is the classic bromance--alongside it, Tarantino employs other mythological Hollywood motives--suspense (the leading to the climactic rumble in Dalton's house), action (the actual rumble), the beautiful ladies and this last one is special. Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate is a character you don't feel you really connect to. This only goes to magnify your fascination. Tarantino follows her with the camera as she goes about her day as if idolizing her--the pure, innocent beauty of Hollywood so close yet completely out of touch.At this point, you might get the impression this is not your usual QT movie. Many Tarantino purists will notice a more softer approach. This is because this movie is about what he truly loves and respects--the art of cinema. His trademark dialogues might lack the usual debauchery, but they are still written with precision. A particular scene in which Cliff finds himself on an abandoned film set now overrun with hippies in which he visits his old friend with whom he used to work 8 years ago finds the two talking in a recurrent manner. It is a great example of a master screenwriter doubling back-and-forth without losing steam (not to mention it was really funny).The climactic point of the film, which takes inspiration from the tragic Tate Murders will leave you surprised. It is an intense scene, yet one that will hopefully satisfy you fully. In the end, despite the people, \"OUATIH\" is mostly about an exclusive world. One in which the lights never dim, the man never gets old and people drive like maniacs. But Tarantino now is a made man in Hollywood, he is on the inside but I get the impression the reality seems disappointing to him. He would rather live the dream. Luckily, he is in the perfect place and industry to do just that.", "I was taken back to Hollywood 1969": "This is my first review ever, so i'm going to try my best here.I loved this movie! I mean LOVED it! Not just because i'm a huge Tarantino fan, but because I was taken back in time to Hollywood 1969, when Hollywood was in its Golden age. Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth work so well together, Leo and Brad both give some of the best performances I've ever seen in film. Leo shows so much passion and love for acting when he's on screen, same goes for Brad. Margot Robbie was incredible! She gives a strong electric feel to Sharon Tate and lights up the whole movie when shes on screen. The whole cast was so well utilized. Each character feels alive and exciting! Tarantino once again gives us an incredible film, which he crafted so perfectly, with every shot. The music, story, and era of this film play a part in the experience and I cannot recommend it enough.", "Still Thinking About It": "I just saw this movie this evening and am still thinking about it. I read other reviews, and believe I see a pattern as to why some didn't like it, and I think it's just lack of appreciation of the time and the storytelling. It was an homage. I remember tv of that era: weekly westerns and crime dramas like Gunsmoke or Perry Mason. Shows that had guest stars who were usually familiar actors from movies or older shows. It was a love story about friendship and honor. What others said was too much jumping around wasn't really paying attention. It clearly stated the dates of what was happening. It was highlighting moments in each character's lives to convey their emotions in addition to tying up the end. And I believe it was a fairytale, hence the title \"Once Upon A Time...\".", "[9.2] A Q.T. work that I enjoyed very much": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is a fine piece of fiction which depicts three parallel stories, intertwined with various degrees of strength and closeness.Is it entertaining? Yes, 100%Is it boring? Absolutely notWho will love it? Those who can sit in place and enjoy unfolding of a fictional yet very entertaining storyWho will hate it? Those who are too hyper to sit in place, to properly relax and more often than not (only) enjoy mind-numbing, (shallow) non-stop action sequences all over the placeThe acting is great by all of the famous cast, as one can expect. Brad Pitt showing again his strong charisma, strength and wonderful acting. Leonardo DiCaprio playing an interesting role, a fading character, all performed easily by his flowing talent. Margot Robbie showing shining beauty, \"swimming\" flawlessly in her environment while turning head after head and making people have amnesia as long as they watch her.The dog was wonderful, loved his very intelligent behavior completed with frightening brute forceOn a side note, IMO, the Bruce Lee sequence was a shame and unnecessary, belittling the legend who wasn't there to beat the crap out of Him, in a real and friendly way!That's a movie that doesn't need advertising and is a force by himself. Watch it and hopefully enjoy!", "Saving the best for \"last\"?": "Honestly, I think it would be a shame if this is QT's last film. He's reached a new level of quality where his technical and artistic excellence match his originality. I hope he reconsiders and continues making more films. This film is clearly his best one so far, and I have enjoyed many of his other films.Having grown up in the era in which the film is set, I was in awe of how flawless all the visuals were as well as all of the cultural cues in dialogue and music. The film captures many nuances of this era so perfectly. The attention to even the smallest details is impressive. Even the inside jokes like all the fictitious spaghetti western posters with people like Telly Savalas were rendered flawlessly. It's hard not to be swept up in the nostalgia of it all.The script is brilliant with absolutely hilarious scenes and so many hidden jokes. With various artistic montages of movie footage, fictional TV footage, as well as real TV footage, the cinematography and editing is equally brilliant. It doesn't hurt to have amazing actors giving some of their funniest performances ever. Leonardo and Brad are the best duo in decades, and why it took QT to elicit this, we'll never know. Al Pacino and Bruce Dern also provide some hysterical characters.This is a movie not to be missed, especially if you lived through the 60s and 70s. It has a long running time, but it passes quickly because it is so damn funny.", "Supremely clever but will be lost on many": "If you are over 70 as I am you should be able to appreciate this one. Not everyone will though! I spoke to another old lady afterwards and she said she was unsure. I remember the time, the style, the people, etc. I like not being told what to think and not have everything spelt out for me. I have stated that many times. It is a beautiful masterpiece. I laughed when maybe I should not have but I could see the humour that was embedded in the spectacle before me. The acting is superb as you would expect. The two main characters are very different and portrayed to perfection. One is soft and sensitive and the other is tough and quiet. The last part of the film is a surprise and is very exciting and that is where I saw humour that probably shocked other cinema goers. Visually it shows the time which is set 50 years ago. Movies were big then too. Hollywood was in its hey day. Girls wore mini skirts. Pretty was in! Just soak up the atmosphere. It is a great film and people with a memory and discernment will recognise that.", "Tarantino does it again!": "One of the best movies of 2019, The acting in this movie is great, the story is awesome, and it's cool how this film takes place in the 1960's. It's a throwback to an era in history, even with all it's faults, there still remains an innocence in American culture that has long since past. Thank you for still making movies for people who love them.", "Another banger from Tarantino.": "This was a surpirisingly chill and hilarious film. Pretty good.", "Tarantino at his finest.": "DiCaprio and Pitt for the first time in a film together and further more the film is written and directed by the 'dialogue master' Tarantino. The thing I love the most in a film are the characters. The more hysterical the better and you have some of the most hysterical characters in Tarantino's films. So yes this was my most anticipated film ever.\nAnd the film does do deliver. The acting is really good by the entire cast especially by DiCaprio, a lot of people are saying that Pitt steals the show with his performance but I don't see that. I think Tarantino could pushed them a bit further but then again it is fine, I'm content with what I got.\nThe slow pacing in the film might get some people off, because Tarantino takes his time here, but I myself think that the pacing is perfect.\nAnd as in any other Tarantino film the music choices are really good, they fit very well to the tone of the film.\nOverall it is a bold film, I had a great time watching it, it's easily Tarantino's most enjoyable film since Pulp Fiction and even though it's not as exquisite and eloquent as Pulp Fiction it might be as rewatchable, we'll see.", "Quentin Tarantino Managed To Pull This Together": "I have to be honest and say that at about the halfway point of this movie I was truly wondering what all the hype was about. It was mildly to moderately interesting to watch the story of \"Rick Dalton\" play out. Played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Dalton was a fading star in late 1960's Hollywood. He'd been a mega-TV star of one of television's ubiquitous western series of the time, but then made the mistake of trying to venture into movies, resulting in the cancellation of his series and him being reduced to guest appearances on various TV shows and, ultimately, to spaghetti westerns. His story - along with that of his stuntman Cliff (Brad Pitt) - was interesting (and even somewhat sad) but wasn't really that enthralling. DiCaprio and Pitt both did good jobs in their respective roles, but I wasn't understanding the hype. Although, right from the start there was an angle; a hook. It turned out that Dalton's next door neighbours were Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate - and this movie was set in 1969. So you knew there had to be some connection coming to the Manson family murders. That angle really was what held my attention. I wanted to see how the stories were going to intertwine - and the movie starts to take a more ominous turn when Cliff finally encounters the Manson family after picking up a hitch-hiker who was a member.It's really at that point that Tarantino's unique touch takes over the movie, and what had been a relatively sedate and somewhat sad reflection on what appeared to be the closing chapter's of Dalton's acting career became a wild ride to the finish. The connection to the Manson family murders comes in the last 20-25 minutes of the movie - but not in the way you expect. This movie constructs an alternate history. The Manson family invades not the Polanski-Tate house, but Dalton's house - and Cliff, Rick and Cliff's faithful dog take them on and do away with them in a violent and bloody fashion that - for all its violence and bloodiness - actually had me laughing out loud at those last few scenes, especially when Rick torches one of them with the flame thrower he had kept as a souvenir from one of his movies. It was indeed a wild ride, closing with Rick being invited to hang out with Sharon tate and her friends after they found out what had happened. It was really a fascinating piece of alternative history, well crafted by Tarantino and there's no possible way that you as a viewer can take your eyes off the screen for those last 20 minutes as the confrontation between the Manson family and Dalton's group escalates in a weirdly hilarious fashion.But perhaps the greatest tribute I can pay to this movie is that while the first half or so wasn't particularly exciting, there was always enough going on to hold my attention. Whle there were times that I found myself wondering where this was going, it never got boring to me, and I was actually shocked to discover - when I checked the time after it ended - that this movie was close to three hours long. It didn't feel it. So it was extremely well paced and it built very deliberately to that unforgettable conclusion. It's very well done. I've had mixed responses to tarantino's films. Some I've liked very much, others have left me cold. But I'd say that \"Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood\" is the best Tarantino film I've seen. (8/10)", "Not a \"feel-good\", but the movie makes you FEEL good": "4 years. That's how long we had to wait for Tarantino to return to the big screen. Now that's an awful long time, but as the saying goes: good things happen to those who wait - this movie does not dissapoint.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's homage to the cinematic world and to, of course, Hollywood as it was back in its golden days - and what a stunningly good looking film it is. You can't help but admire the broad colour palette, the beautiful cars, old school billboards and the gorgeous neon lightning of the many cinemas, which together manages to create a more than believable 1960's Hollywood. An almost glorified version perhaps - in a good way - like a piece of candy you just want to reach out and grab. While mentioning the beauty of this film, one cannot forget to also mention the soundtrack, that is as close to ear-sex as you can come. I myself have listened to \"Bring a Little Lovin'\" on repeat since i left the theatre.The movie circles around the outdated actor Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) and his stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), as well as following Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) on her daily adventures. The main story at hand is the one of Rick and Cliff, but for those well informed knows that the year of 69' was a special one, in a sort of way, for Hollywood. Without saying too much, it involves Sharon Tate and Charles Manson. While being the background story, and the one inspired by true events, it fits really well with Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth's story. And Tarantino being Tarantino, you better believe that he \"Tarantino-fies\" the whole situation.At the same time as Tarantino is being Tarantino, it is also a very different movie than what we're used to seeing. It touches on the brink of comedy, but not the silly comedy that were used to in films such as The Naked Gun or Mr.Bean no, this is Tarantino comedy. And my god he handles it well. The whole movie is a beautiful roller coaster, with not a lot of steep ups and downs, but with mature humour that is sure to make an audience have a great movie experience. As to give an example: seeing Brad Pitt play a minacious stunt driver, with a sketchy past, getting high and having a gun pointed at him is hilariously funny, and it's also one of the best scenes in the movie.Do you need to mention the acting? When you have names as Margot, Brad, Leo and even Al Pacino himself you expect stellar performances - and that is what we got, plain and simple. Leo gives his best ever performance, Brad is scary good as a mysterious stunt driver, Margot is absolutely wonderful as the joyful Sharon Tate, and Al pacino, well, Al Pacino is Al Pacino.Tarantino said this is the closest he's ever gotten to recreate Pulp Fiction. He also said that he put it all into this film, and you really can feel it. To experience Tarantino at this level is truly breathtaking. With the natural talent found within him and all the experience he's gotten from his past of remarkable films, he brings it all out on this one - and it pays off. You can feel Tarantino's breaths (Not literary, that would be somewhat disturbing) sitting opposite the movie screen. You can feel his heartbeat (Not literary either) pulsating throughout the film. All of his passion and love for cinema is felt right through the screen and it touches your feelings. It makes you feel good.Sad as it is, Tarantino has stated he will only make 10 movies - which I respect. After Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's release, he has stated he might retire before his 10th. How sad it is, this film feels like the perfect end note for him. I wouldn't say he is at his peak, because he has peeked ever since Reservoir Dogs, but with this film he has truly proved himself as a master of cinema.", "I don't understand the hate.": "Very engaging film. Brilliant acting from Brad and Leonardo. Margot Robbie was a necessary part but it felt like she was rarely in it aside from the end.I believe the hate towards this film is by people who just don't get the Tarantino way of doing things. I agree some can be an acquired taste but once upon a time in Hollywood was gold.", "Pure cinematic delight": "Tarantino is my favorite director, and this is easily one of his best efforts, with hints of Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds.\nFinally he gets to work with Pitt AND Di Caprio, and it's pure delight. It's all about the acting as usual, but it's also a proper period piece based loosely around real events. Might be too slow for some, but I feel sorry for them. This is true filmmaking through and through. I could have watched it for another 3 hours. And then the Tarantino kicked in at the end, and it was cathartic.", "Wonderful brilliant atypical Quentin filled with his passion": "The strength courage and talent of a writer/director is often overlooked - how to lift your cast above the rest, above their best, and keep to that characterization from first moment to the last.Quentin moves his characters like a chess master, add to that his passion and admiration for television of the late 60s, spaghetti westerns and knowledge and appreciation of the film world, with Quentin twists and turns, with a brilliant sound track costuming casting - I loved this film.Don't walk run to watch it don't read reviews don't get caught up with finding out too much of the plot (do that afterwards if you don't know or appreciate the late 60s and history that era)...Leo at his best\nPacino should stay away from Scorsese a lazy director and stick with Wuentin\nBrad yes an Oscar and the rest of an ensemble castI wonder if Roman Polanski watched the film .\nWhat an ending makes me weepy weepy weepy", "Hollywood Bravado": "Love it or hate it, there are many fictional liberties taken in Tarantino's cinematic nod to Hollywood Stars and celebrities of the 1960s. The comedic scenes, banter, and callbacks are genius (the best Tarantino has ever produced) but overall the script is overindulgent in its world building. This isn't top tier Tarantino, it's probably in the low-mid tier \u00c3\u00a0 la The Hateful 8 or Kill Bill Vol. 2, but regardless Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is still a must see movie experience.", "This warmed my heart": "I love Tarantino movies, but this review isn't so much about the movie as it is the story itself. I know quite a lot about the Charles Manson Family and the evil they wrought. I doubt the average viewer of this movie can appreciate what Tarantino did with this story if you don't know the ugliness of what happened.Instead of giving credence to the horror, Tarantino re-wrote the end to punish the killers and spare Sharon Tate and her friends.I keep thinking about how beautiful the Sharon Tate character was. This movie honored her life. She wasn't just Roman Polanski's \"wife\", it portrayed her kindness and her budding career. I loved the part where she watched herself in the movie theater!In the heartbreaking saga of Manson, Sharon Tate has been an afterthought. Showing us the fullness of her life and completely omitting how she died is a beautiful and meaningful act of justice. It robs the killers of their infamy and restores a sense of dignity to her memory.I've never really seen that done before, and I just want to hug Tarantino for ending it the way he did. The movie was pretty good-it was a little slow, but I enjoyed it. The meaning of it in the end was so important and beautiful though.", "A tribute to Hollywood": "This movie has Hollywood in the title but not just because it's about the case Tate-LaBianca wich was passed in Hollywood, this has Hollywood in the title because this movie is all about Hollywood. Tarantino made a tribute to Hollywood and westerns and movie making and everything about that life and that's represented by Rick Dalton's character. All those western scenes and old movies/tv shows scenes were a tribute to the Hollywood old times. Although the movie is centered on the case Tate-LaBianca I don't really think you need to really know the case to enjoy the movie, if you know the things will obviously have a bigger meaning especially the ending but if you don't know this movie is also worth it and enjoyable. About people saying that this has no plot what I have to say is: you misunderstanding! In this one Tarantino did what he had done before in Inglorious Basterds, he decided to rewrite the history but this time was not about war and Hitler and nazis, this time was a more quiet and peaceful history so there's not so much action, because this movie is more about real life. Both Rick and Cliff are characters created by Tarantino with the purpose of rewriting that tragic event, until there he used them to tribute the history of Hollywood with beautiful scenes. It's more a nostalgic and beautiful trip than a typical violent and with a lot of story Tarantino movie, but we can see classic Tarantino by the last events of this movie. The movie has a lot of symbolism and even mention other real cases like that one about Cliff killing his wife was a mention to the Natalie Wood case. It's a movie that has a lot more than what you think at first sight. I think that this is more likely to be approved by true cinephiles with a real and deeper understanding of the movie and his context and not so much for the average movie viewer who just wants to have a good time.", "Tarantino's 9th feature is his most pared back, thoughtful and perhaps personal work to date.": "Revolving around and driven entirely by its characters, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' has no discernible narrative to follow and certainly breaks the mould. It's exactly those qualities that will put some off, especially those expecting something more familiar and less tame. That being said, I personally think Tarantino has, once again, delivered a gem of a film with masterful writing and directing (the characters, the production design, the visuals, the soundtrack - I love it all), as well as magnetic work from an insanely talented cast who fill the screen with charisma. What it really is, is a look at a particular time in Hollywood history as seen through the iconic director's eyes - a strange and unusual love letter to it, so to say - and that won't be for everyone. For me, it was captivating from its beginning to its very Tarantino-esque ending that was the icing on the cake.", "Best movie of the year": "One of Quentin Tarantino's best,the chemistry between Brad and Leo works great with the movie", "Please keep making movies Quentin": "From the start I had to laugh. You just know there are some people who confuse Brad Pitt with Leonardo DiCaprio and vice versa. So it was hilarious that Pitt played DiCaprio's stunt double (although we never got a chance to actually see this). Plus, you know people have been saying for years \"Make a movie with both DiCaprio AND Pitt\". Done.A classic Tarantino period piece with a unique storyline. About 30 minutes before the end I sensed a lull, but then, forgetaboutit - it hammered the point home. But be ready for this almost 3 hour movie. You do not want to miss a thing.Classic Tarantino violence, that Tarantino gets away with for obvious reasons.The ending is how we all wished the true story would have ended. For sure. Pitt plays almost superhero status. So does Brandy.The acting is fantastic. From DiCaprio's built-in stutter to Pitt's bond and calmness unless provoked.Fun ride.", "Awards are coming": "Cancel all award shows this film will sweep the board.\nA cinema masterpiece, in sound and vision.\nThis is the greatest film ever made by this director, trumps Kill Bill vol 1.\nThe film is well paced and doesn't feel like 2 and half hours. Go and see it", "Probably not for today's movie-goers.": "First things first: if someone claims this movie has no plot or story to tell, then they probably dont have a very deep understanding of story telling, nor a great breadth of knowledge on how different people are affected in different ways by varying acts. To say you don't like the movie because you're bored or disinterested is fine, it's not your cup of tea; but to say it has no plot or story is an embarrassment to anyone who would utter such nonsense.Once Upon A Time In Hollywood has one story with 3 different character arcs. The way they all exist so independently and yet so intrinsically is a fantastic capture of the way real life works. These arcs are revealed rather subtly, and to some, possibly too slowly. I suspect for today's audiences it would have been better if Optimus Prime showed up and told DiCaprio's character that he had the power inside himself all along before he goes into some kick-ass scene.The trouble with Tarantino's storytelling for some is that he tells 3 different stories that aren't the point of the film. So when the ending comes it may seem disjointed to those who need movies spelled out for them. But the point of the film is driven by the 3 separate arcs that the individual characters went through. Had they not gone through their own stories, then this magical once upon a time would have been rather flat. But as it stands, real people experienced various things that brought them all to a beautiful intersection of life.I would compare this movie to something like Midnight Cowboy. Not so much the story as much as the way life comes together for unexpected conclusions. I'm not going to go on real long about this movie because there just isn't time enough in the day, but I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves creative cinema, or at least creative storytelling.Advice: Bone up a bit on the Manson Family or you will be lost. Most YouTube documentaries will do the trick just fine.", "Once Upon a Time . . . . . . .": "Thanks Q.T. for writing this period piece. I was in the Army in 1969. It does homage to a well-known, historical truth by changing it. I almost left the theater half way when I perceived the subject. If it had been depicted I would have walked out. Instead, I can reflect on the truth without the details.", "Outstanding Picture, slow build": "A visually captivating movie by Tarantino. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio played their characters to perfection and will most likely get oscars for their efforts. Trailers paint this movie to make it seem Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate is a main character, which is not the case, so don't go in thinking it's mainly about Manson, because you'll be disappointed. The last 20 minutes or so is classic Tarantino. Brad Pitt is hilarious and it's just fun to see him in this role. A very well done drama, just remember one thing, this movie is mainly a DRAMA. Not a normal Tarantino action movie, he focuses more on bringing back the narrative of what a movie is supposed to be, instead of some of the lousy pictures we get today. 10/10 for #9. Can't wait for #10, his official bow. It's going to be a classic.", "Tarantino at his best.": "Finally. A fresh movie with complete originality and a story that leaves you wanting more. Brad and Leo paired together again, present an astounding and quite wonderful take on the 60's.The first two hours are a little slow yet still convincing and gripping in more ways than one. The last forty minutes are classic Tarantino. Humour, blood and violence all mixed into a perfect cocktail that delivers moment after moment of movie bliss.I want more already. Keep it coming.", "Tarantino back at it again!": "10 stars from me. Absolute perfection. As good as Pulp Fiction.", "Exhausting...": "Sitting through a film (I'm English) for that amount of time for 10 minutes action that has a tenuous link to a non existent plot was hard work.How has this got a review rating of 8.0 when the overall consensus is its a pile of do do is beyond me!", "A sincere love story": "This movie was beyond my expectations. It was a warm, sincere love story between QT and all that was genuinely incredible about Hollywood and the magic that was created during the 'Golden Age'. The story line between the two leads was a wonderful thread woven into a great narrative and very well crafted. The emotional end was the outcome we would all wish for - but the ugly face of reality was present - but dealt with in a way that should have been the reality. QT is a master story teller and his dream of this beautiful fairy tale is one where we can honestly say ' they lived happily ever after...'", "Boring or Disrespectful": "My first reaction was, \"Who is the audience for this?\" Manson, Helter Skelter, the Hollywood of Sharon Tate are almost in the forgotten or unknown history of anyone under 40. Will the audience pick up the subtle establishment of these historical characters? Unless they go to the theatre prepped with the significance of the dates, will they know the context of the plot. If they think this is a movie about the fading trajectory of Hollywood careers, they will find the plot very slow and plodding. If they are knowledgable enough to know the Sharon Tate's story, they may feel the weight of the inevitable hanging over the whole piece, but, even with this stellar cast and a pervading anticipation of doom, this movie spends a lot of time on nothing. Personally, I think the cheat at the end is not a good enough payoff for the 161 minutes. The acting is good enough for a 6 (fair) out of 10, but Tarantino come close to boring us to death or, worse yet, disrespecting the victims of a shocking evil. {Criminal Dramedy?}", "Insufferable": "The acclaim for this movie baffles me completely. I am no fan of QT films to begin with, but this one commits the biggest sin of all: Boring! This is pretentious, self-indulgent drivel. A complete waste of all the fine actors in it. You have to be some sort of cynical masochist to sit through it.", "Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood": "8/10 - certainly a unique cinematic experience with a stellar cast and an entertaining plot to fill the almost 3 hour runtime", "This Movie is a 10+": "Quentin Tarantino has created my new favorite movie.The detail, the era was obviously something that QT loves and wanted to share and I'm thankful for such a Master Piece. I lived in the areas that this movie was shot in so, I may be somewhat biased?QT is one of the best!", "Best Tarantino Film So Far!": "I love mostly all of Tarantino's films, but Jackie Brown & Once Upon A Time in Hollywood are my favorites! I love these 2 films the most because they're different from all of the other Tarantino films. I'd put (Let's hope for a Volume 3) Kill Bill Volume 2 after Jackie Brown in my favorites. Pulp Fiction is great, but isn't my number 1 favorite. Django Unchained felt too long, Death Proof is okay. Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece, and one of the greatest films last decade. Not every Tarantiono film is for everyone, including for fans. If you don't like his Jackie Brown kind of style of his films and more Kill Bill, you might be a bit dissapointed. This is my favorite Tarantino film because of it's rich storytelling, outstanding acting, smart dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and great soundtrack. I love the ending, and is my favorite Tarantino ending, and one of my favorite endings of all time. I loved every moment of this movie when I saw it, and was a breath of fresh air after the bad The Hateful Eight. If you like Tarantino's Jackie Brown style, you'll love this movie! My favorite movie of the year so far!", "People giving this a 10, 9, 8 like movies with no plot!": "Quentin Tarantino thinks he can just put any old rubbish out and the public will watch! Yes they will Quentin but only because of your old movies.. This movie to me was nothing! meant nothing! did nothing! I would add spoilers in my review but there weren't any! Seriously where is your head at Quentin? Maybe i'm completely missing the point of this movie but to me it was just a nostalgia piece of movie making.", "A great ode to Hollywood and cinema itself": "Greetings from Lithuania.The more you like cinema itself, the more you will likely to enjoy \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" (2019). This movie is about movies. Movies they were once, not now. Movies when there were stars with names, faces. Now it is a color of spandex that separates faces or characters. Back then it was different, and better.Tarantino's latest has most in common with his previous movies with ending and dialog. Those are as usual involving like no other. Ending is like its own \"Inglorious Bastards\", fictionalized, but so so satisfying. Because this movie is about movies and those who are in love with them, and not about some dark humans.Overall, without any spoilers, i highly enjoyed this almost 3 hours Tarantino's movie. Its a great one. Not his best, but a one that shines with all that makes great movie - it looks like it was made like some 40 years ago, by its style, its settings and etc. This is a great movie for those looking for a something entirely different than today's mainstream cinema, yet superb.", "Great timepiece": "This has a nice laid back late 60s California feel to it ,Stella performances from Leo and Brad and brilliant direction from Tarantino .\nA slice of life from a bygone era , I was not looking forward to the end but IMO this was far better", "A bromance, a ray of light and a slow drive through the Hollywood Hills...": "Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood\n35mm Print at The Hollywood Theater\n7/25/19I must confess; I am really struggling on my approach for reviewing this film. Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood Is a monument to so many grand and large-scale subjects. I am having a hard time writing because I am still processing and digesting what I saw. I couldn't sleep last night. The images and lines of dialogue circling my brain and tormenting me. Once Upon A Time was my last thought before I eventually slept and occupied my mind first thing upon waking.This is a different story for Tarantino. No stranger to altering history to fit and build his narrative, Once Upon A Time is still so unique. We all know it's roughly based on The Tate, Polanski, and Manson horror story of the late 60's, but it's presented in a way that I believe only Tarantino could have shown us. It takes it's time, I mean really takes it time. Tarantino's films are usually a pot boiler of suspense and pressure, building the tension throughout the entire film, a juggernaut sprinting to the finish line for the big payoff; Once Upon A Time takes a slow drive through the Hollywood hills. Large parts of this film take place on the set of other movies. Literally. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Rick Dalton, an actor on the wrong side of his prime. Bloated from booze, tired and struggling to stay relevant. A large portion of this film is Dalton's internal torment. Every actor faces obsolescence, it's inevitable. At what point do you hang up the gloves and accept it?Dalton's stunt double, errand boy, and bro til' the very end: Cliff Booth, is played by Brad Pitt in the greatest performance of his entire career. We spend a lot, and I mean a lot of time with Cliff, which is fine with me because he is the best character Tarantino has ever created. We sit passenger with Cliff as he drives though 60's Los Angeles, we spectate him goofing around on film sets, we see him in his crummy trailer, and not an acting trailer, it's his shabby little home comfortably parked behind the drive-in theater. What makes Cliff so fun and interesting is that this is Cliff's reality. He likes his life and he loves his friend. Tarantino never resorts to the easy path. Cliff never gets jealous of Dalton, doesn't mind fixing his cable antenna, loves being his driver, always there to pump him up and remind him \"Hey! You're Rick Dalton.\" Success is relative and for Cliff someone who clearly wasn't born into Hollywood, this is just too much fun.This movie is a large wonderfully written love letter to 60's Los Angeles, Hollywood, commercials, cars, fashion, feet (a friend and I coined 'ham-footed', we know Tarantino has a thing for feet, but jeez there are a lot of women with bare feet in this movie and usually right up in the camera), film and all of its facets, movie sets and production, all of the things that fascinated a young Quentin and inspired him to make movies. He adores them all, but the one aspect of this movie I feel he loved the most was Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate.Robbie is undeniably one of the most talented and exciting performers in recent memory. She absolutely stuns in everything I've seen her in. This role was handled with a lot of respect, admiration, and love for Tate. She's the bright, beaming ray of light this often troubled and at times very dark film clings to. I love that about Tarantino, his films center on strong women. Some of them stone cold killer, samurai sword wielding angels of pain and death, some of them are just regular people. Tate was undeniably special and mesmerizing, but she's played and written so casual and natural. We see her go to the theater to watch herself in a movie she stars in, hoping and praying for that validation as the audience reacts to her scenes on the big screen. She's like us. Better, but similar.Everyone is going to talk about the end of this movie. I will not spoil anything. I had no idea what we were building up to it until we were there. This film is not aimless, but so deftly builds in tension I had no idea we were already two and a half hours into the film. I did not want to see a pregnant Sharon Tate's fate in this movie. Talented as Tarantino is, I couldn't think of a way he could make this in a tasteful way. In my mind, the story ends in a perfect way. My two friends joining me were split on the ending. Not so much the content but the ideas. \"These are real events and real people with real lives, this is based on.\" It made my friend a little uneasy and said the feeling sat with him the entire film. While I respect and love my friend. I saw this movie a very sweet testament to a time that had a, well, most would say innocence, I say ignorant bliss. The end of an era. The Manson family murders changed everything. The way the world changes after a massive tragedy.Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood is Tarantino's grandest film. I would call myself a casual Tarantino fan, I have a ton of respect and admiration for his movies but am far from a fan-boy. That stated, I have to say without a doubt I've never been more excited to see a movie. I didn't watch trailers, I didn't read reviews, I wanted to be surprised. I love blind jumping into films and having no idea where the bottom is. Once I adjusted to the pace and stopped trying to analyze every single frame, I realized what this man was working towards and what kind of film he was making, I let myself fall under Once Upon a Time In...Hollywood's enchanting spell and went for the ride. I was lucky enough to catch a 35mm film print on preview night. At two hours and forty minutes I was still hungry for more. This film continues to sit in the forefront of my mind and will stay with me for a very long time. I must see it again.", "If this is his last movie then I'm more than satisfied with his career": "I think this movie isn't for everyone and that probably movie buffs will like it more than general audience. Cinematography is beautiful, movie is very funny and DiCaprio steals every scene for me. Ofcourse, the movie has his style like foot fetish and brutality. I loved the little details and easter eggs that are connected to his other movies. I felt like it is his very personal film and I respect it. Great choice of music.", "Great cast! Unusual Tarantino movie!!": "Let me tell u m huge Tarantino fan,this may not be his best work,, still the stellar cast n performance make ur day!! Leo like always amazing,,worth watching performance comes frm Brad Pitt, i guess bcoz of his good looks he dsnt get tht much of credit for his acting,however ths time he surely wll tke a cake!!", "Excellent movie": "Great directing and cinematography. Leo's best performance since the Wolf of Wall Street.", "Perfection": "Every single time after i watch the latest Tarantino movie my first thought is it can't get any better than this... and i'm always wrong. This man is a genius.", "Seriously Boring": "I was reading someone else's view on this film, and they candidly admitted that the first hour was simply a lame documentary of the '60's that encourages the viewers to guess all the obscure Hollywood references to actors, film projects and commercials from the '60's. The story line focused on a loser actor who's career was going down the toilet. The second half of the film focused on the Manson cult and its victims. Barely fun, but I actually lived through the '60's. In real life, Tates father had to clean his daughter's blood out of the carpet of the home they rented. Sorry, but it's just not funny. Happy ending to the film, for the wasted time to get there. Pitt was the only fun in the film.", "1960s Hollywood nostalgia mixed with wish fulfillment": "I'll make the bold statement that this is writer/director Quentin Tarantino's best film thus far. However, \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" is also Tarantino's most specific and idiosyncratic of film, which is saying something from the man who's made a career of making incredibly idiosyncratic films seemingly made only to sate no one but his own tastes in cinema, which makes the film also his least accessible. The story revolves around fading Hollywood star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his loyal stuntman/personal assistant Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) figuring out what to do next with his career. Having been the star of a number of Audie Murphy-type of genre pictures and the TV western \"Bounty Law\" (which Tarantino actually wrote multiple teleplays for and teased he'd like to film on day), Dalton now finds himself relegated to guest spots on TV series as the villain so producers can build up their new stars by showing them killing off the star of \"Bounty Law.\" Dalton has to make big career choices, deciding whether to continue acting on American television or consider opportunities to star in low budget Italian productions, much like Clint Eastwood did following his stint on the TV western \"Rawhide,\" as did many other fading Hollywood stars and B-level actors. The other significant story thread that looms large over the film is Dalton's new neighbors, real-life director Roman Polanski and his young wife, actress Sharon Tate. They are introduced early and although a majority of the film follows Dalton and Booth, the audience is kept in suspense with the prescient knowledge of the horrific Manson Murders. The Dalton/Booth story and Manson story cross paths when Booth flirts with a hippie chick who invites him to drive her out to Spahn Ranch, home to the infamous Manson Family, as well as a blind and bedridden George Spahn, a brilliant Bruce Dern, who's renting his rundown backlot western town to the group. The film's one scene at Sphan Ranch is the closest Tarantino has ever come to making a horror film and the scene is incredibly creepy and unsettling. Tarantino does what he does best, which is build slow burn suspense that grows to an always satisfying climax (i.e. Bruce facing down Zed and Maynard, the opening scene of \"Inglourious Basterds,\" or almost any scene in \"The Hateful Eight). What he does so well in his films is that he establishes the threat of violence and keeps ratcheting it up until you can't stand it any longer, climaxing in an explosion of violence, which makes me really wish Tarantino get behind the camera for a full-on horror film. But I digress. \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" is a love letter to the era it's set, creating a fairy tale world where there is a mourning for the passing of old Hollywood as well as a celebration of the new. It's hard to say whether I enjoyed more the film's characters and story or it's recreations of 1960s Hollywood. The Cinerama Theater, Bruce Lee working as Kato on the set of the Green Hornet (getting his ass handed to him by Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth in a somewhat controversial of a scene), to the charming backlot filming of various TV shows and movies, are all utterly enthralling in this Hollywood dreamland. This is one of those films where you just want to step onto the screen and live in this world. Though equally compelling are Tarantino's characters and plotting, which get better with each film. While DiCaprio's Dalton is completely vapid and self absorbed, but the audience can't help but root for the guy. While he's seemingly an empty shell, Dalton is talented and his loyalty to Booth is endearing, as is Booth's loyalty to Dalton. There's one scene in particular that stands out in the middle of the film where Dalton has a crisis-of-faith moment while making a TV western guest villain appearance where he pours his heart out to a precocious child actress whom his TV villain has kidnapped. The scene manages to be sincere, touching, and utterly hilarious. The child address, Julia Butters, nearly steals the scene from DiCaprio. With the exception of the film's finale, this is likely the most memorable scene in the film. As with most of Tarantino's films, he features a cast that's as eclectic as they are talented, which includes Margot Robbie as Tate, Emille Hirsch as her friend, Timothy Olyphant as an up-and-coming TV actor, Dakota Fanning as Squaky Fromme, and also Luke Perry, Al Pacino as a hilarious agent, Kurt Russell as a stuntman (possibly connected to Stuntman Mike in \"Death Proof\"?), Lena Dunham, Maya Hawke, Danielle Harris, Martin Kove, Clu Gulager, Rumer Willis, Rebecca Gayheart, Zoe Bell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and James Remar. Tarantino often has great casts in his films, but this one is really special. Robert Richardson captures the era with dynamite photography, which feels both nostalgic while also capturing the Hollywood fairy tale elements of Tarantino's vision. Much credit also has to go the the production design team, who made this feel like an authentic vision of 1969 Hollywood, though it could very well be the Hollywood versions of 1960s Hollywood, and in either case, it's stunning. And without spoiling anything, the film's finale is ridiculously fun. In summary, if you love the types of films Quentin Tarantino loves, which runs the gamut of low-budget genre pictures to foreign arthouse flicks, you will find \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" an utterly enchanting film experience.", "Among Best Film Industry Films": "The Movie (\"OUATIH\") moves immediately into my top five favorite movies about Hollywood and that's a tough class to crack; e.g., Sunset Boulevard, Singing In The Rain, The Player! Always believed Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction to be showy, pretentious nothings, and Kill Bills silly. But with OUATIH this Quenton fellow has made a good film. Shave a half hour by clipping the Where Cliff Lives, Tate at Movies, the Little Girl n' Book, Flying Back From Italy, Too Long in Bar ... and you've got a GREAT movie. The sets and props are stupendous, right down to a case of 6 oz. Cokes. Spahn's Ranch was so scary because QT painted it look so believable. Encounters were great, Cliff v. Bruce Lee, Pacino and Dern turns .. and the ending ...already a legend. Don't miss OUATIH.", "Nostalgic Tarantino": "The pacing and somewhat sparse use of dialogue at times in this film was reminiscent of Tarantino's earlier work, like Jackie Brown. Brimming with the typical nostalgia troupes and Easter eggs that would expect of this director. The high voltage glowing neon sign relics are something to behold in itself. As it has been highlighted, it's not for everyone, but it does make one think even if it was not as expected. I myself am intending to go for another viewing in the cinemas soon enough to fully gauge the narrative that has been created.", "Modern Masterpiece": "The best performances I've ever seen from all three of our main characters, this film just has so much passion and spirit you can tell it was made by someone who really cared about the project. I just saw it for the second time and I honestly think it's a modern masterpiece that's quickly becoming one of my favorite movies of all time.", "'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' Review": "Quentin Tarantino's tale of a TV-Western actor and his stunt double, and how they collide with the Manson Family in the Hollywood of 1969, is a heady engrossing collage of a film - but not, in the end, a masterpiece.\nIt has been 25 years to the day since Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, crystalizing a cinema revolution, and we have never looked back. Yet here's one more QT anniversary, a bit less monumental but, in its way, as meaningful: It has been 10 years since the premiere of \"Inglourious Basterds,\" which also took place at Cannes - and for me, at least, that means it's been a decade since Quentin Tarantino gave us an unambiguously great Quentin Tarantino movie. You know the difference as well as I do, because it's one that you can feel in your heart, gut, nerves, and soul. It's the difference between a Quentin movie that's got dazzle and brilliance and a number of hypnotic sequences, and is every inch the work of his fevered movie candy brain, and a Quentin film that enters your bloodstream like a drug and stays there, inviting (compelling!) you to watch it again and again, because it's a virtuoso piece of the imagination from first shot to last - and every moment is marked by a certain ineffable something, the Tarantino X Factor that made \"Pulp Fiction\" the indie touchstone of its time. \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,\" which premiered today at Cannes, is not that X Factor movie - though for long stretches (a good more than half of it), it feels like it could be. It comes closer than \"Django Unchained\" or (God knows) \"The Hateful Eight.\" It's a heady, engrossing, kaleidoscopic, spectacularly detailed nostalgic splatter collage of a film, an epic tale of backlot Hollywood in 1969, which allows Tarantino to pile on all his obsessions, from drive-ins to donuts, from girls with guns to men with muscle cars and vendettas, from spaghetti Westerns to foot fetishism. In this case, he doesn't have to work too hard to find spaces for those fixations, since Tarantino, in this 2-hour-and-39-minute tale of a Hollywood caught between eras, is reaching back to the very source of his dreams. In \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,\" Tarantino tells the dual story of Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), who starred in a black-and-white TV Western series called \"Bounty Law\" in the late '50s and early '60s, but whose career is now hitting the skids; and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), Rick's longtime stunt double and best pal, who has basically become his gofer and driver. Both are drawling, easy-going good ol' boys who are functional drunks (Rick favors whiskey sours; Cliff likes his bloody Marys), and they've been kicked around Hollywood, but they've got a yin-and-yang thing going. Rick, who appears to be based at least partly on Burt Reynolds, is an instinctive actor, a gentle charmer, and a secret softie in a brown-leather jacket - the first Tarantino hero to prove that real men do cry. (When the tears come, it's for how badly Rick has let his career melt down.) Cliff, by contrast, is a war veteran and rough-and-tumble stud bruiser who lives in a cruddy trailer next to the Van Nuys Drive-In but seems happy and satisfied, like most Brad Pitt characters, with himself. When he's crossed, he will kick the bejesus out of anyone, and he's got a bad reputation. The rumor is that he killed his wife and got away with it. (A flashback to a scene on a boat with that very wife, who digs at him mercilessly, doesn't spill the beans, but it's not exactly evidence that the rumor is false.) The first half of \"Once Upon a Time...,\" which is the superior half, is set in February '69, and Tarantino views these two characters with a straight-up macho humanity that is gratifyingly unironic. DiCaprio and Pitt fill out their roles with such rawhide movie-star conviction that we're happy to settle back and watch Tarantino unfurl this tale in any direction he wants. And he does digress, in that following-his-free-associational-bliss way. A car-denting, fists-meets-martial-arts duel on the set of \"The Green Hornet\" between Cliff and Bruce Lee (played to ferocious perfection by Mike Moh)? Why not! A scene with Rick, playing a black-hatted villain on the new series \"Lancer,\" getting into a philosophical chat about acting with his 8-year-old girl costar, who's a budding feminist Method Actor? Bring it. And when Cliff, driving Rick's cream-colored Coupe de Ville, keeps passing an outrageously flirtatious teenage hippie vamp in cut-offs and a halter top, who lives with a guy named Charlie at the Spahn Movie Ranch, the sense of worlds colliding, in ways as sinister as they are vibrant, feels right. Many have turned the spectacle of Charles Manson and his girls into drama, but Tarantino is onto something by viewing Manson's followers as ominous harpies who also incarnated a new kind of sexualized feminine consciousness. And Tarantino takes us deeper than we've been into the life of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), who along with her husband, Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha), has rented the house next to Rick's on Cielo Drive. Robbie nails Tate's wide-eyed slightly aristocratic sensual daze, and has a lot of fun in a scene where Sharon goes to a movie matinee to watch herself in the Matt Helm caper \"The Wrecking Crew,\" exulting in her performance as she props her dirty bare feet up on the seats, so that Quentin - in an image he uses as a motif more than ever before - can park his camera in front of them, as he does a little later with the Manson girls. In \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,\" Tarantino re-creates the Hollywood of 50 years ago with a fantastically detailed and almost swoony time-machine precision, and it's not just about the marquees and the billboards featuring end-of-the-studio-system-era corn like \"Three in an Attic,\" or all the juicy Top 40 chestnuts on the soundtrack. The movie captures how Hollywood, by 1969, was a head-spinningly layered place. Here's the TV-cowboy mystique of the '60s, which is really a degraded schlock echo of the movie-cowboy culture of the '50s. Here's the rock 'n' roll of the moment (Paul Revere and the Raiders, \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\"), which popped like crazy yet with a rambunctious easy-listening bounce. And here, beyond the music, is the new noisiness of America: the \"hip\" commercials blaring from transistor radios, the TV sets that never get turned off (even the Manson girls are TV zombies), the flamboyant hippie garb that's starting to go mainstream, turning the counterculture into a living fashion boutique. Here's a Playboy Mansion party where Steve McQueen (Damian Lewis) is hanging out, as you might expect him to be, but then so is Mama Cass (Rachel Redleaf). McQueen, talking to Rick, fills in the back story of Sharon, Roman, and their friend Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch), the hairdresser who is still in love with Sharon - and, according to McQueen, is hanging around with them because he's biding his time, waiting for Roman to screw up his marriage. At that point, we're hooked enough on Tarantino's heightened version of true-life Hollywood that this love triangle sounds like a little movie of its own. Rick, on the set of \"Lancer,\" turns out to be a desperate but terrific actor. There's a sensational extended sequence of him playing the villain, forgetting his lines, hating himself in the trailer, then revving himself to go back and give a hell of a performance, and it's all a testament to what an extraordinary actor DiCaprio is. Pitt is just as inspired. The sequence in which that Manson girl, named Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), gets Cliff to drive her back to the Spahn Movie Ranch, where Cliff used to shoot Westerns, and where he meets the Family (though not Charlie, who is only in the film for about 30 stray seconds), is creepy, suspenseful, and vengefully gratifying. All Cliff wants to do is say hello to his old colleague George Spahn (Bruce Dern). But to do that he's got to threaten his way past Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning), who sleeps with George to secure the place for the Manson cult. In the late '60s, a lot of people passed through Spahn Ranch, and this encounter - though, of course, pure fiction - plays with an eerie plausibility. Rick has an offer on the table, from a shrewd if scuzzy agent (Al Pacino), to shoot a Western in Rome. The prospect fills him with despair; he thinks spaghetti Westerns are the bottom rung of the entertainment totem pole. In a sense, he's right, but he goes and does it, taking Cliff with him, and he spends six months there, making a few more movies; he comes back with an Italian wife. And it's just at around the point of his return that \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" begins to move forward with less cocksure bravura, less virtuoso snap. In the movie, Tarantino has already introduced a narrator, who he uses sparingly, but then he starts to use the narrator more often, breaking the show-don't-tell mystique, and we wonder why. Isn't he the master of showing?\nIt's now August 8, 1969, and the rest of the film is devoted to Quentin Tarantino's version of how the Manson murders play out, which I will not reveal. I will say that what Tarantino does here rhymes, to a point, with the violent climax of \"Inglourious Basterds.\" Yet that movie, as much as it toyed with history (which was no more, really, than any of the late-studio-system World War II movies it drew from), was also, in the largest sense, true to history. Hitler got destroyed, and the Americans won. Which is, in fact, what happened. The way Tarantino plays with the Manson murders in \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" is at once more extreme and more trivial. And frankly, for this Tarantino believer, that made it less satisfying.", "Classic Tarantino": "Very much the ultimate Tarantino film. In some places it can be a bit of a slow burn, but aren't most Tarantino films?. Love the lead characters, great seeing Pitt and Dicaprio working together, the onscreen chemistry is great to watch. Some great dialogue. Great bit of action towards the end, love it. Go watch it", "A work of genius": "People giving this film 1 out of 10 are bonkers. There is so much to love here and Tarantino takes you on a huge journey. I think some people just expect slam bang excitement every 10 minutes or maybe they didn't get the event the film is based around. Either way, this is the type of film about Hollywood that Hollywood doesn't make any more. Proper, slow burn intelligent storytelling, where the various threads pull together at the end brilliantly. Nobody makes films like Tarantino. He's a living auteur and the choices he makes in this film are breathtaking. Bravo.", "The Parts Are Better Than the Whole": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is consistently engaging and enjoyable. This lengthy film does not have much of a plot supporting it. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt give outstanding performances worthy of praise, all of the other cast members are nearly as good in smaller roles. Quentin Tarantino's nostalgic obsessions fill every frame, sometimes distractingly so. Although enjoyable to watch and expertly-made, this film seems likely not to be as well-remembered and quoted as many past Tarantino films have.", "An Immersive Experience": "Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has a much different feel compared to his previous filmography. Instead of tense scenes and thrilling action, Tarantino takes a more unique unconventional way of telling a story (which is, of course, what make him famous in the first place). Rather than having a clear narrative, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood feels like a collage of scenes that are connected by overarching characters, themes, and location. Some might think this is a negative of the film, but I thought it was one of the best parts of the film. Instead of having a straightforward narrative about the Manson Family, this film lets that idea bubble under the surface while exploring the ideas of changing times, the rise and fall of one's career, and a relationship between an actor and his stunt double. This story structure allowed each of the three main characters (Sharon Tate, Cliff Booth, and Rick Dalton) to shine in their own scenes and really explore their character. Yet, all three characters storylines have common themes, which hold the film together.On a technical level, this film is far above most Hollywood blockbusters. You can feel the artistry behind the camera. Instead of green screen sets and backgrounds, the sets are actually constructed, which give a much dirtier and lived in feel to the location. The best sets are the streets of Hollywood. I think I could watch Brad Pitt drive around those streets for hours. The amount of detail that went into all of the sets is astonishing and I'd hope to see this film be nominated for best set design. Not only was the set design great, but the shot composition, acting, and costume design was all top notch. Margot Robbie was perfectly cast as Sharon Tate, and Brad Pitt and Leo's chemistry was excellent.Overall, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It had some great moments of comedy, suspense, and drama. The characters are wonderfully crafted, and the film culminates to an exciting 3rd act. I think I have to rewatch a few of Tarantino's other movies, but this might be one of my favorites. I plan on seeing this one again very soon.", "Struggles of Mid-life Crisis and Good vs. Evil": "Actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and stunt man Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) are two best friends having a mid-life crisis in 1969 Hollywood. Dalton, who stars in a TV western series, \"Bounty Law,\" reflects on his life and believes he should have done better as an actor and should have been offered more challenging roles. Booth, once suspected of killing his wife, also believes he should have achieved more in life. Dalton is somewhat bitter, but both men exhibit an ability to care about the people around them. They also have a certain degree of decency and morals and the wisdom to recognize evil when they see it. This is especially true of the scene in which Booth visits the Spahn Ranch and recognizes the evil atmosphere perpetrated by the hippies who live there. After forcing one hippie to change his flat tire, Booth escapes certain death by driving away from the ranch just as Tex Watson, intent on killing any trespasser, returns on horseback from a tour of the ranch. For all that their own lives have been less than fulfilling, Dalton and Booth use their acting and action skills to become real-life heroes by defeating evil at the end of the film.", "Just needed one more small thing to happen and it'd be a 10": "Those last 10 minutes.... holy cow! About as satisfying an ending QT has conceived, rivaling Inglorious Basterds. But those waning moments aside, this movie was absolutely hysterical. Leo's self-loathing diatribes were comedy gold. Brad Pitt's mannerisms and delivery of his lines rivals his genius portrayal of Aldo Raine in Inglorious Basterds.Now it's a revenge fantasy, so you know QT took some creative liberties with the Manson Family saga in the late 60s, but here is one thing that was missing: a satisfying death of the ring leader himself, Charles Manson. I understand the 3 involved at the end of the film we're actually the 3 who murdered Sharon Tate and her friends, but can you imagine if Charles Manson decides himself to show up to Rick's house only to meet Cliff, Brandy, and Rick, fresh from taking names (no you're name was dumber than that... classic line!)? That would've made this a 10. However, this movie was as good as it gets. Well done QT for not caring what the PC culture says and being you, you made a gem. Last word, give Leo and QT the oscars, because both give their best performances to date, but Brad Pitt stoke the show. Amazing movie, can't wait to see it again!", "Another Great by Tarantino.": "Review:\n'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is a comedy-drama film directed by Quentin Tarantino.\nFrom when this movie first started, I knew I was in for another masterpiece from one of the greatest filmmakers alive. Tarantino is one of those directors that you love him or hate him, and most of movie lovers choose the ladder.\nSet in 1969 Los Angeles, the film follows an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt), as they navigate the changing film industry, and features multiple storylines in a modern fairy tale tribute to the final moments of Hollywood's golden age.\nWe all know the actors in any Tarantino movie brings their A-game. We just haven't seen anybody act the way they do in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio was great as an actor on the brinks of being a has been and struggling to keep up with the greats. My personal favorite is Brad Pritt as DiCaprio's stunt man. He was so funny and when he was needed to be serious, he brought it!\nThis movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. One of my favorite scenes is when Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are sitting on the couch watching a screening of DiCaprio's shows and doing commentary on it. It was great.\nOverall, this movie was a high anticipation of mine and it did not disappoint. It has great performances and tells a high stakes story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n5/5", "Best Tarantino Movie!!!": "This movie is elevated by Brad and Leo their performances are amazing, the story in this movie is super fascinating and I loved the setting of 1969 Hollywood, the guest starts are a huge plus and I loved the guy playing Bruce Lee, also the ending of this movie is so crazy it sealed the deal on this being my new favourite Tarantino film!", "thanks QT, for all the years": "Despite this disaster, we must appreciate the work of Quentin. He did a lot for the younger generations and for those who where ignorant or unknowing, to build respect for the unique work of artists, directors and film musicians of the good old movies.\ni loved ALL his projects and the thoughts behind it. He did a great great job, and now its time to say goodbye. Every creativity comes to an end at some point.\nQT: you did good for 8 times!", "Strap up for another QT ride!!": "A fun ride during the darkest year of the flower children. The yuppie/hippie/serial killer generation. QT antihero's at it again. For what the OG Helter Skelter gang did; this was a sweet retribution piece. Next maybe an OJ ass kicking? Oscars throughout, enjoy..", "The Genius of Quentin Tarantino displayed in every word and frame.": "My Review- Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.My Rating 10/10I've been waiting for this film and wanted to see it first day of release so have avoided reading reviews or too much background to it as I wanted it to be a fresh experience.For that reason I'm not giving any spoilers regarding the plot other than what anyone can see in the trailers,don't let anyone spoil your enjoyment of this great and important film by spilling the story plot or fascinating climax.Actually my perception of this film is two movies in one about characters some fictional like Rick Dalton the cinema tv action movie star ,who's career is in a decline with yet another superb performance from Leonardo Di Caprio and his affable buddy stuntman Cliff Booth also superbly played by the ageless Brad Pitt, has he sold his soul to the devil! ,he's 55 years old for Gods sake.The main characters,real and fictional in this nostalgic ,humorous, dramatic love poem to the demise of \"The Golden Hollywood Years\" don't really connect till the great climax ,of the film which some fans have criticised but I thought perfectly captured the fictional \"what if\" style of Tarantino this film is truly only slightly based on real events but demands we know some facts about the real characters.\nIt's fantasy illusion ,isn't that what Hollywood and Cinema do best?It's set in the dying days of The Golden Years of Hollywood and the end of the 1960's when teenagers wore flowers in their hair and Hollywood Celebrity party's had a somewhat free love debauched pre AIDS Great Gatsby style .\nThe great soundtrack of these parties included Paul Revere and the Raiders,Four Tops and Deep Purple and the hit movies were Polanski's Rosemary's Baby ,Valley of the Dolls , Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet ,Funny Girl and Steve McQueen's Bullitt.The second movie in one that fits seamlessly into the fictional plot concerns actual characters primarily the ill fated actress Sharon Tate played beautifully by our own Margo Robbie ( Australian stars are shining all over Hollywood).\nMargo is glamorous in this and perhaps isn't as stunningly beautiful as Sharon Tate but she captures the essence of her character humorous and fragile and wears the stunning late 1960's costumes by Arianne Phillips superbly ,all the costumes, the sets the cinematography add to the authenticity and attention to detail that a Quentin Tarantino movie demands.Quentin Tarantino ,winner of 2 screenwriting Academy Awards for Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained is one of the few true geniuses of Cinema making and this film has Academy Award nomination worthiness in every frame.As writer director and co-producer of this magnificent love poem to the end of the Golden Years of Hollywood and the beginning of Cinemas greatest threat Television,thank goodness both have thrived and survived but the only way to appreciate this film is on a Cinema screen.Please comment on your reactions whether you agree with me of not I'm fascinated in what you think of Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.I can't wait to see it again ,there's so much in this film.", "Good movie": "Good solid 8 star movie. Worth going to see it at the big screen.", "Straight!": "I have not seen much movies of Brad Pit, i mean i barely only know one movie of him that i had watched: Mr and Mr Smith and i don't remember that i have seen any of his other movies but in this movie, his acting is just mind blowing. His character as a Cliff Booth is totally lovely and i really adored him. I have became fan of him now for his genuine acting in this movie. As Leo, all time best actor of me, he did really a fantastic job again.Story line of this movie is so straight, this movie is full of drama and real things. There is no unrealistic story in that, all scenes are mattering and each scene has actually surprised me.to this movie, i would say i have became the fan of Brad Pit for his genuine acting.", "Take my Breath Away": "Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt ACED this film! Best Dynamic Duo ever! Giving lots of Praise to the Cast and Quentin Tarantino for the film! This is a must see film! Highly recommend it! 10/10! Definitely gonna get this film when it comes to Blu-Ray!", "Longer than it needed to be (and not in a good way)": "This is a tricky one. The acting is superb trhoughout. DiCaprio does himself proud, as does Pitt. It's shot well, it's incredibly nostalgic, but I can't help feel it's missing something. The last 30 mins are ace - that's where the positive reviews are kept. Tarintino does what he does best in that last half hour. It's a shame it took two hours to get there. More time developing the final storyline and less nostalgia would probably have led to a better experience. Or tell the same story in 90 minutes. The soundtrack was ace - pure sixties.All in all, go see it, but go for a wee first.Plot 3/10\nActing 9/10\nEnding 7/10\nDuration vs interest 3/10\nSoundtrack 7/10Overall 6/10", "Awesome movie! A classic!": "Tarantino's a true talent in telling stories through films. This one is definitely a classic revived....Helter Skelter meets \"Bonanza!\" Kudos to Tarantino!", "Quentin Tarantino is the truth": "Films needed saving this year and oh boy Tarantino saved the s*** out of it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood may not be Tarantino's best work, but it damn sure comes close to taking that spot. The directing is phenomenal, Quentin Tarantino exquisitely shows once again why he is one of this generation's auteurs. The performances from everyone, especially Leo and Brad, are extraordinary and the writing is superb, as were given dialogue that only Tarantino could pull off. If any other director/writer tried the conversations he works in this film; then half the audience would probably have fallen asleep. This also may be Tarantino's funniest film yet, and because of that, it made for one of my favorite theatre experiences of the year. I don't think I've laughed that hard at a movie as I did with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. However, with all that said what may be the most impressive thing about this film is the cinematography and set pieces. Tarantino does a fantastic job transporting the audience into this world, and I never felt for a moment that this wasn't Hollywood during the '60s.Nevertheless, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not perfect, it's pretty damn close to it, but I do have an issue with the film, and that's pacing. Throughout the film, multiple scenes could be removed from the final cut and wouldn't affect the outcome of the movie at all. While other (necessary) parts of the film are way longer, then they have any right to be. Unnecessary scenes, info, and dialogue are my biggest gripe with Tarantino as a writer. You could, however, look on the other side and say that those \"unnecessary\" scenes are quite entertaining, and they usually are, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is no exception. Although it has those elongated dialogues and unnecessary scenes, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is still pretty entertaining at being gratuitous so it somewhat (not entirely) makes up for it.In a year full of unoriginal and disappointing films, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood truly stands out from the pack. Tarantino's ninth film is not without its faults, but what film isn't? Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, elegantly displays why Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest filmmakers ever and is easily the best film of 2019. An obvious recommend.", "Crazy arsed fun masterpiece": "I must preempt this by saying I an a huge Tarantino fan. Now I can say this is not his usual fare.Really good fun and full of surprises. Leo, Brad and Margot are sensational. The script hilarious and every scene a delight.A few laugh out loud moments and hooting by the audience. It really transports you to Hollywood in the 60s/70s.Tarantino's attention to detail is exquisite. This is really not to be missed!Please God don't let it be Tarantino's last!!!", "For the love of film, and of Hollywood's waning golden era": "\"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" (2019 release; 161 min.) brings the story of struggling actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double Cliff Booth. As the movie opens, we get a clip from NBC's \"Bounty Law\" TV series, and Rick and Cliff are interviewed (all in B&W). We then switch to \"Saturday, February 8, 1969\", and Rick is worried about his career, wondering what to do as a next move. Meanwhile, Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate land at LAX, creating a media frenzy as they walk to the airport. They drive home and as it turns out, they are next door neighbors with Rick Dalton... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest opus from Quentin Tarantino, and only the 2nd film crediting him as writer-producer-director (after 2007's \"Grindhouse\"). Here Tarantino recreates and re-imagines Hollywood's waning days of its so-called golden era (culminating in real life with the murders of Sharon Tate and others by the Charles Manson crazies). By mixing real-life and fictional characters, Tarantino creates a parallel universe, where he is of course in complete control. When I say \"recreate\", it is really that. No amount of detail is too small, check out the street scenes as Rick and Cliff are driving around. Pay close attention to what all is in the background, and you'll see what I mean. The film is helped immensely by the utter brilliant lead performances from be Leonardo DiCaprio (as Rick) and Brad Pitt (as Cliff). In particular DiCaprio (playing multiple characters in movies and TV shows) gets to stretch in a way that demonstrates, once again, why he is among the very best actors in Hollywood. Per the usual from Tarantino, the soundtrack is chock-full of great music from that era. While I recognized quite a few tunes, I was also pleasantly surprised with the more obscure songs. Bottom line: I really, really enjoyed this film. The proof is in the pudding: I was absolutely astonished when the house lights came back on. Had 2 hrs. and 40 min. passed by just like that? Apparently they had!\"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival, to immediate critical acclaim. The movie opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati (in a medium-sized theater) was sold out down to the very last scene. First signs are that the movie have performed much better at the box office than projected (now expecting to deliver $40+ million). If you are a fan of Tarantino or simply love a well-crafted look at Hollywood's waning golden era, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.", "A Fun Ride to Nowhere...But, It's All About the Ride": "For three hours, this was an evenly paced and balanced story. The larger story is filled with sort-of vignettes that are each interesting. The 70s sets are superb and make the story fun; in fact, the sets are like a separate character. There are some funny scenes, darkly funny scenes, suspenseful scenes, wrapped into an alternative reality based upon reality as fiction, which is great and different. It was extremely creative, with great acting. It's simply tough to top the creative masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, and this story feels a bit forced, all in. I've tried to balance my QT expectation accordingly, but it did not move me, teach me, excite me, etc., in any way that resonates. Margot Robbie's smile, Brad Pitt and the Cadillac stick in my mind. This movie is a time and character tapestry that needs to be assessed as such, rather than a typical linear plot-based movie.", "Lacks continuity": "Movie is all over the place the first 2 hours. Just a bunch of different scenes which have little or no connection to each other. Decaprio's character is shown acting in numerous fictitious movies and the scenes are way too long. The scene when he's in his actors trailer lamenting over his career problems is painful to watch and again way too long. The director put text labels under the names of actors like \"Steve McQueen\" while they're at a playboy mansion party for some reason. I felt this to be strange but accepted it thinking it must be very important to the plot line to know who these people are. It wasn't as they had no bearing on anything. I guess Tarantino just wanted us to know that top actors of the era were attending this party??? Oh and he also may have revealed a foot fetish as the sight of dirty bare feet are everywhere to be seen, and in close up detail. \"Sharon Tate\" is a central character- too bad she has no significance to the ending; which I won't spoil. Overall, the acting was decent but the story was severely lacking in many ways. The things that happen have no meaning and are often implausible. In my opinion the movie's only redeeming feature is the nostalgia, which was done in pretty meticulous detail. I imagine a good part of the 90 mil budget was spent on this factor. In summary, I would definitely not recommend paying to see this film. And only if you really appreciate the cars and nostalgia of the era should you spend nearly three hours of your time on this high priced star studded disappointment!", "Perfect left me wanting more": "Once Upon a Time is a masterpiece. Tarantino delivers per usual and left me wanting more. Pitt and DiCaprio Are hilarious together. The movie could've been an hour longer and I wouldn't have noticed. OUATIH is perfect and I can't wait to watch it again. All hail the king Tarantino!", "Tarantino's best works, must say!": "It's a classic film indeed, and the beauty of this film lies in the journey of 2 varied characters set in Hollywood during 60's.\nThere are some beautifully written & enacted lengthy scenes which made me comfortable and relatable to the atmosphere created in that era and to add there is some real good humour.\nThe filmmaker exploits the maximum from his ensemble cast. There are some noticeable aspects - every possible transition tried to show time progression(through text, through dialogs, through narration), slow paced (contrary to the characters speeding their cars in this film) yet never felt a lag, every other character carry depths in their graph, and this film has an unusual cold ending.\nThis film may not work for you if you are looking for a plot line or a storyline, this is purely character driven film - journey of 2 beautifully written characters enacted aptly by Di Caprio & Brad Pitt.\nOnce Upon a time in Hollywood- A beautiful experience. Highly Recommended", "Sit back and enjoy": "This film is definitely a love letter to Hollywood of the late 60's. I was born about the same time as the film takes place. I remember so many of the little things in the picture, as most were still around to the mid 70's. A younger person will not get the same enjoyment as someone my age, but by 17 year old son also enjoyed the film. This is not really comparable to the storyline of any other Tarantino film but it is clearly one of his films.", "'How to manipulate \"found art\"": "I hear a lot of people once again panning Mr. Tarantino for disrespecting certain people portrayed in his latest venture and mistaking the dialogue in this film for being his trademark dialogue whether either good or bad this is not the case. Let me expatiate: What we are looking at is a manipulation of something that has already happen we know the original story because its part of our history, but what the artist here did was pose the question: \"what if?\" In order to break through the spheres of the past to recreate a new future we must somehow bend time in the present just enough to create a rift in reality to birth a new parallel universe in which now the artist can answer the initial question with a whole new concept thus we bend time enough for this new reality to manifest itself before us, and here it is done, once again with style, a style and a surreal timeline in which thing unfurl, much a very new and experimental effort by Q.T. we have never seen before, one that excels his hitherto fun narratives in a fresh and strangely different way, for one, there is no story, there are just characters existing in this strange universe going against the face of everything we know to be real and constant and pulling it off, how I don't know but it just works. Ask yourself, why is Brad Pitt's character portraying a stunt man, we know him as one of the greatest living thespians of our time and yet here he can scarce get a job as a stunt man as people who first meet him keep saying , 'gosh that's strange, your the prettiest stunt man in history\" haha... yeah, where does that happen; where is the greatest fighter of all time, in all of human history, Bruce Lee not able to back up his bravado as he tries to fight awkwardly maladroitly in a silly fighting sequence in which Brad beats him up, hello? It's not a diss on Bruce at all, its supposed to evoke in his greatest fans a sense of good humor and fun in an absurd backwards homage to the legend himself. This has to be in order to get to the climacteric at the end and have this incredible big sequence in which the ultimate new reality takes place in a heretofore terrible situation in our human history as Brad and Leo transcend and rise as the ultimate anti heroes to this quirky and very thoughtful very fun tale! It was just fun and cool and wholly different style to Q.T. , if you didn't know it was him, you would never know from this gem, especially from his so called \"brand\" of dialogue!", "Best Tarantino since Pulp Fiction": "Very well made movie. Great effects, and filming. Would say may be even a better film than Pulp Fiction. Love the humor, and the storyline.", "Better than Parasite": "Is my bias showing? I spent the Summer of Love on the Sunset Strip. Luckily, I guess, I never met the Manson Family. But I know the story well. To see it retold by Tarantino was a joy, as were all the cars of the late 60's. I didn't see so much as a street sign that didn't belong. So this won an Oscar for the set. Great. Stil, Tarantino deserves to be recognized for his writing and directing talent.\nI'm getting tired of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I guess he played the part as required. I'm writing this because I was about to leave a 1 star review for PARASITE but there were plenty of those already. I felt like saying something positive.", "Days of Hollywood Past.": "Ever since watching Pulp Fiction in late 2017, I've been a fan of Quentin Tarantino and his filmography. As a director, Quentin is nothing short of masterful in the realm of storytelling and as a writer, he's one of the best at writing dialogue and referencing pop culture in a way that sounds natural and helps the story rather than just trying to be trendy as well as his ability to writing flawed yet likable and charismatic characters as shown in Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill films. So, when I heard that Tarantino would be making a film about Hollywood in the late 1960s and would focus on the Charles Mason murders, I was pumped beyond belief so when I did see the film in August of this year, I came out a bit perplexed but happy by what I had seen. Despite a few small issues, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a masterclass in filmmaking and shows why Tarantino is one of the best directors working in Hollywood today.The film opens in early 1969 where Hollywood actor Rick Dalton, star of a 50s' western show, worries that his career may be ending and casting agent Marvin Schwarzs suggests that Dalton star in Spaghetti westerns but he refuses to do so. Rick's friend and stuntman, Cliff Booth serves as Dalton's driver due to his alcoholism resulting in numerous DUIs. Meanwhile, actress Sharon Tate and her husband Roman Polanski move in next to Dalton. Now, Dalton and Cliff must find a way to reinvent themselves as the Hollywood landscape changes before their eyes amongst a background of changing tastes and sinister people.Simply put, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a fantasy, no question about it. The mystery at the heart of the film lies in reuniting both its adulthood as well as its innocence. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has notably marketed as Tarantino's next to last film even though there's an awful lot of back and forth on that matter as well as being packed with a proper sadness. This sadness is reflected in a number of a different way, most apparently in the movie's 1969 setting. Here, Tarantino brings the Los Angeles of the late 1960s to life from the drive-in movie theaters and Old West film sets to celebrity parties at the Playboy Mansion. The majority of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place over the course of one weekend in early 1969. The story gives us exact dates with a clear purpose as the film begins a mere 6 months before the Manson Murders occur. To some, these killings marked the end of the 60s along with the hippie culture and the hope and optimism that movement had fostered. As such, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood feels like a countdown to the end of an era both for Hollywood and for the 60s as a whole. A lot of the film feels like a death march setting up an evitable end. When watching the movie, the viewer gets the sense that there is something sad happening within this world.There's no shortage of self-importance and narcissism in the claim that the 1960s ended simply because of a few savage murders in Hollywood that involved a couple of celebrities. Given how much of the mess the USA was in 1969, it's not really surprising as US troops were slogging it out in Vietnam and Nixon had just become president. Hell, Warren Beatty actually based the film Shampoo around the Manson victim Jay Sebring, and actually considered adding to his murder, however Beatty felt that this would portray a very selfish history of the late 60s and, instead built the film around the idea that celebrities were removed from what was actually happening in the world. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood only briefly explains any kind of reality outside of the glitz and glamor of Hollywood as there are some faint news reports of the chaos unfolding on the outside being heard through a car radio. Receiving a ride from Dalton's stunt man Cliff Booth, a young hippie complains that actors only mimic reality while people are dying out in the real world. Of course, this young lady is being a complete bigot as she's part of the Manson Family, a cult built around Charles Manson whose brutal actions were entrenched by his own failed attempt at stardom and whose crimes targeted celebrities while on a hunt for celebrity status.So there is a sense of fulfillment in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in the form of the same kind of self-praise that one would expect from a movie made Hollywood about Hollywood. Now, to be fair to Tarantino, the film is intelligent enough to wear its viewpoint on its sleeve and also remain shrewd enough to ever-so-slightly hide its romanticizing of history. Even more than that, Tarantino has a filmography that is largely rooted in virtuous anger and avenging bloodshed, so the kindness and sympathy of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood feels very much like an understandable end-of-career exercise in self-praise. Indeed, your opinion on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood will depend on the degree that you are able to handle Tarantino's style as there are a fair amount of people who aren't fans of his style of filmmaking or storytelling but in my case, I happen to love Quentin's style when it comes to story and characters. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is an astonishing work of kindness and understanding. Tarantino's gift for sympathy has always been something unnoticed by film audiences and critics alike, maybe because his sympathy tends to be in league with characters who have done terrible things to those who in turn have done terrible things to them in return. In Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, that sympathy feels a lot more hazy and philosophical. In its own right, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the most sincere Tarantino film since Jackie Brown.Of course, the big question with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is if the audience can or is able to connect with Tarantino's sympathy as most all the subjects of his sympathy are completely deserving of it. In the case of filmmaking, making your characters sympathetic and relatable is critical in getting the audience to care about them. If the viewer doesn't emphasize or care about the lead hero or what stakes he or she must face then in my opinion, the film has failed and no matter how hard the director and writer may try to make the viewer care about the protagonist, they won't be invested in the character or their journey if the lead isn't empathetic. Thankfully, Quentin Tarantino is a master of this as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood gives us one of the best lead heroes in any Tarantino film in the form of Rick Dalton. Dalton is portrayed as a has-been cowboy actor who feels out of place with the changing landscape of Hollywood in the late 60s and it is this pain that shows itself most prominently in a scene where Rick appears on a teen show but also in his distaste for hippies. Dalton drinks too much, is erratic in his behavior, too worried about his image as an actor and horribly out of tune with what is happening in Hollywood at this time. Early on in the film, casting agent Marvin Schwarzs suggests that Dalton should do Spaghetti westerns in order to keep his career afloat but Rick sees those as beneath his talent range and refuses. Even so, we can tell that Dalton is a good person at heart. He takes direction fairly easy, he sometimes falters in delivering his lines and feels bound by a foil of insecurity and practices his lines with the help of a tape recorder even if his drinking cleans that out of his mind.Now, compared to protagonists in other Tarantino movies, Rick Dalton isn't exactly the epitome of a perfect person but he isn't a terrible person either. Even more than that, he does try and he gets the job done. And given the fact that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood never seems to condemn Dalton. Some of the film's greatest moments are when we see Rick's fears show themselves in full force as an actor, capturing both his grasp on his current predicament as well as his dream of being something more than just an actor. As Rick purely comforts a young actress that he was never actually considered for Steve McQueen's role in The Great Escape, the viewer is allowed a peek into Rick's head to see a different version of the classic film. Dalton is the main driving force of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood but he isn't the only focal point for the movie's sympathy. Much has been said about how the film treats the character of Sharon Tate, most notably the film's habit of just focusing on her and not giving her much in the way of dialog but these objections are missing the point what Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is trying to do with the character of Tate. Sharon isn't really treated like a character here nor does the film try to make her out to be an emblem.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood never turns Sharon Tate into anything as stereotyped as a tragic symbol of classic Hollywood or the human manifestation of the late 60s nor does the movie never reduce Sharon to anything as lowbrow as what one might see in a Michael Bay film. There's a sense that the distance that the film is putting between itself and Tate is meant to respect her as a person rather than provoke newspaper gossip or rumors of any kind as well as avoiding overpowering her influence with Tarantino's creative voice. Instead, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood feels like an almost peaceful approach to the way it treats Sharon Tate and given what happened to her, it's for the best what the film and Tarantino do with her. The film plainly centers on Tate just being in the story rather than be the main focus of it. The majority of the film's story is disconnected from the Manson murders by a six-month gap so any time that it does spend with Sharon Tate is simply showing us a day in her life. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood doesn't treat Tate as a clone of Rick Dalton, declining to comment on the well-publicized issues that were troubling her at the time such as her battle to be taken seriously as an actress, the thought that she might consider retiring from acting and her problematic relationship with Ro", "Duo of Awesome": "If I didn't walk out of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and not loving it, I would be disappointed. It has Leo and Brad Pitt sharing the screen together. The amazing Margot Robbie and even Al Pacino! Well, the movie was very good but it was a little underwhelming.The film is about the friendship of Rick Dalton, a struggling actor on TV, and his stuntman Cliff Booth. There's a sub plot about Charles Manson too. Now there's some great scenes in this like Pitt against hillbillies and Leo struggling on the set of a film. It just that the film feels slower paced and halfway through the movie you would be screwed if you had to write an essay on what you just saw. Quentin Tarantino is known for that. He doesn't follow the rules. However, the ending is great.Pulp Fiction is my favorite Tarantino film but Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds are close. This is better than Hateful Eight but not sure where I place this on the Tarantino list. Definitely not top 5 and it should have been with this star power.", "It all was Always Leading to This, wasn't it?": "Once Upon A Time... in Hollywood, is the 9th (and presumably penultimate) film from Quentin Tarantino and at this point in his career, you kind of know what you're expecting. A cast filled to the brim with character actors, and modern day movie stars, a 60s LA Rock soundtrack, and more movie references than you can shake a stick at. And while, yes on the one hand, you get exactly what you'd expect, it's delivered in a way that he hasn't even attempted since Jackie Brown.There is not much story to speak of: Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former television star now suffering a mid-life/career slump after a failed forays into movies. His only comforts are his best friend and long-time stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who in many respects has it worse than Rick due to an incident involving the death of his wife some years before, and the fantasy that his next door neighbors Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski will invite him over one night and relaunch his career.Before the inevitable third act blood-fest, the film is ostensibly a hangout movie, following Rick, Cliff, and Sharon throughout a day in 1969 LA. The scenes are more of a vehicle for Tarantino to get in all his favorite parts about pre-70s LA into one film. KHJ radio, cineramas, and old TV Procedurals.It feels almost redundant to go through every Name in this movie, but all I can say is, I can only imagine half the budget went to paying their quotes. But I feel the need to call special attention to Al Pacino as Marvin Schwarz, Julia Butters as a child actress on Lancer, and Dakota Fanning as Squeaky, none of whom are in the film for more than ten minutes each, but give some of the most committed performances of the cast. Another standout is Margaret Qualley as Pussycat, who goes from alluring to annoying to downright repulsive by the end of her stint with Brad Pitt.There are the obvious cameos like Timothy Olyphant's James Stacy, Mike Moh's Bruce Lee, and Nicholas Hammond's Sam Wanamaker (sporting a beautiful white turtle neck) that pop up every now and again. This is coupled with the cameos of Tarantino's favorites from back in the day (play I Spy and try to spot Clu Gulager, Bruce Dern, Ram\u00c3\u00b3n Franco, James Remar, and Rebecca Gayheart...to name a few) all come together to round out a spectacular ensemble cast.But the focus is kept where it should be: on Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, who are at the top of their game. They are committed, they are here for it, and are so damn fun to watch. The mood is infectious and by the end of it you want to buy a pack of smokes and hit the road with a pal. Brad Pitt specifically plays the most fully realized character, and the anchor of the film. The scene when he finally arrives on Spahn Movie Ranch is Tarantino at his best, amping up the tension every passing second.This really is Pitt's movie, he's as cool as Steve McQueen, as breezy as John Wayne, and as hard to hit as Bruce Lee. He is comfortable with himself, and where he is in life. He is unburdened by the same delusions of grandeur that his best friend Rick is. All he wants out of life is to maybe get back to working as a stuntman, but if that's impossible, a life spent with his best friend and dog isn't a bad alternative.There is a moment where Kurt Russel reveals to the audience that Pitt \"killed his wife\", though it is not confirmed either way what validity that statement has. It's an aside, one of those unsolved Hollywood mysteries like: How did Natalie Wood actually drown? Even with this information, though, you are resolute in liking Cliff Booth.The film is not without its faults: the most major one being Rick Dalton. Not Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, which most certainly elevates it, but the character as written. He has a lot in common with Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction, is he really cool? Or is the actor playing him cool? That is to say that Dalton's struggle is well established, and DiCaprio is committed to the role, but not as much time is given to him as a person as say Pitt's Cliff Booth.Sharon Tate serves as more of an egregore, an embodiment of free-living 60s, where you picked up hitch-hikers and watched movies with your shoes off. It's clear what she represents to Tarantino: the living symbols of the Hollywood that is coming to an end. However, many will be put off by her lack of dialogue, even though it doesn't hinder her performance in any way: most audiences are hardwired to associate dialogue with character development.I also can't help but feel that Jane and John Q. Public will be bored by the film, especially the two hour build-up to the forty minute punchline. Not to mention that with an increase of streaming services and Marvel movies, moving exposition ahead of atmosphere, the long strings of silence will undoubtedly unsettle many viewers.Finally, let's talk about that punchline: If you don't know anything about Sharon Tate, Charles Manson, Tex Watson, and the Manson Family... I'm afraid this ending might be lost on you.But all of these are minor nitpicks in the grand scheme. One can hardly complain when a filmmaker like Tarantino works at this level. He is the last filmmaker who makes films like this, and will probably be the last one for a very very long time. I can't imagine a young filmmaker in today's political climate pulling off what Tarantino pulls off.A film that empowers it's female characters while also fetishizing them. A film that glorifies white macho men while also showing how pathetic they can be. A film which views the system it is presently working in as both meaningless and the only thing that really matters. An ending that is both the most feel good moment of the year, and the most dower ending of the year when reminded of the reality.It really is the film that sums up Tarantino as a filmmaker the best. Self-indulgent, derivative, and flawed, but you've gotta look past all of it and see the gigantic heart behind it.", "More": "I think if QT gets the funding then there is a part 2 coming up. Lots more cigarette smoking ads under the radar so that shouldn't be a problem!\nA typical QT movie with all his personal idiosyncrasies. Period music and what not.\nHe made the Reservoir dogs come to life too. In a dog of course.\nBrilliant in a lot of ways, but pure QT. He's is still alive and well as Johnny Winter once scribed.", "A NEW TARANTINO CLASSIC": "Quentin Tarantino's long but enjoyable retro trip back to the late 60s in Hollywood, California just before the brutal Manson murders. It concerns a fading television cowboy star named Rick Dalton, played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio who earned an Oscar and Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor for his unforgettable performance, and his aging longtime devout stunt-double and best friend Cliff Booth, marvelously played by Brad Pitt who won an Oscar and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for his impressively endearing turn, who was also a war hero that now does very little stunt work, he is more a driver and gofer for Dalton. DiCaprio and Pitt have an endearing chemistry that is the heart of the film. Dalton has made some bad choices that has set his career back, and his pushy agent, Marvin Schwartz, wonderfully played by Al Pacino, has talked him into making some Spaghetti westerns in Europe, which he hates the thought of doing, but does it anyway. He returns to Los Angeles after shooting these films with his new Italian wife, Francesca, nicely played by Lorenza Izzo, to face an uncertain future in Hollywood. Dalton's next-door neighbors are film director Roman Polanski and his gorgeous actress wife Sharon Tate, wonderfully played by the stunningly beautiful Margot Robbie. But unbeknownst to Dalton, Cliff and Francesca is that they are about to become unwittingly entangled with the murderous Manson family. As slow-paced and sometimes uneven as this extraordinary film is, it is still an unique piece of virtuoso film making, especially the shocking hyper-violent climactic alternate reality ending which is pure Tarantino, and absolutely jaw-dropping. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Tarantino who also wrote the captivating Oscar nominated and Golden Globe Award winning original screenplay, and gives his film flawless period detail, and magnificent Oscar nominated cinematography by Robert Richardson. Exceptional supporting performances by Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Julia Butters, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Luke Perry, Damian Lewis, Michael Madsen, James Remar, Danielle Harris, Clifton Collins Jr., Marco Rodriguez, and Rumer Willis. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture. A new classic! Highly recommended.", "I just kept waiting and waiting........for 15 minutes of action": "The reviews on this one are very mixed . You either love it or hate it . What I can say about this movie is that I didnt hate it , but I was really expecting a lot more of a QT movie. The first two hours of the movie are just boring , nothing really happens and then in the last 15 minutes of the movie there's a lot of action. I'm sorry but this just didnt do it for me", "Stop complaining that it isn't historical": "It's not supposed to be historical. It's intentionally revisionist. That's the genius and heart of it. I thought the ending was brilliant.", "The long of it": "Let's get some things off my chest from the start. The movie itself felt like it could have been shorter. It didn't seem necessary to be so long. Also I am in the corner of people not happy about the depiction of Bruce Lee and the \"excuse\" Tarantino came up with didn't really help that cause (first saying it's just fiction to then go on saying Bruce was like that/the way he portrayed him). Let's be clear, I never met Bruce, but the way he was depicted in here, felt disrespectful at times (making him look dumb for a joke that is also in the trailer).Having said all that, you do get the Tarantino genius and his flavor is there and can be seen overall. A friend commented on a scene (a dog being fed) and likened it to the relationship between Tarantino and the viewer. QT being Brad Pitt in that situation and the viewer of the movie being the dog. Patience is something that is rare and also something that Tarantino may not find in many viewers either.Acting is superb, editing is great and the story while far removed from the actual events, is fun to watch. So don't expect historical accuracy also don't expect Margot Robbie to talk much. That doesn't mean she doesn't have an impact. It also doesn't mean QT is sexist. It's just another thing critics will latch onto since there's no motherf'in Samuel L. Jackson here to just spew the n word.While mostly slow and really mellow, there are some violent moments in here that may be too much for some viewers. Be warned, this is Tarantino after all. And he can get explicit in his depiction of violence. This is also a movie that is able to grow on you, even after initial rejection ... but that will be up to you and your willlingness to think about it way after you watched it", "Tarantino on top form": "\"Once Upon a Time\" is first class Tarantino. DiCaprio and Pitt are brilliant as fading actor and stuntman friends Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth.Behind the gloss of Hollywood, there's an air of suspense and tension as the calendar and clock countdown to one infamous fateful night.Rich in atmosphere, beautifully written and shot, this is essential viewing.10 out of 10.", "Waste of time...": "Complete and utter waste of time.\nThis was so incredibly slow, boring and with no actual intellectual attributes at all.\nWith a few very attractive stars being its' only positive. Even that does not make this worth watching. 2.5 hours I'll never get back.", "Wow! Watch this movie!": "First of all this movie isn't very violent by QT standards. Yet there is this sinister anticipation of violence that makes it scary because of what you know happened in real life. It's difficult to discuss this movie without revealing the ending, which is actually what makes this movie.\nHere comes the spoiler. It's a fantasy like Inglorious. Everything you want to have happened to those horrible killers in the real life events you get to see. There is a pent up justice against the digusting serial killers that get off so easily. QT manages to turn a story about one of the worst incidents in California history into a feel good and affecting wish fulfillment story. It's not an account of the murders, it's what you wish could have happened instead.\nBrad is the unlikely hero and although weatherbeaten he is still a big screen hero. Leonardo does a great actor facing a crisis in his career. He is a sympathetic character surprisingly and his story is quite interesting. Margot isn't as pretty as the real Sharon Tate but she does a good job at evoking sympathy with her joyfulness. Dakota is memorable as one of the irritating hippies.\nWhat a feel good movie!", "Totally get why people didn't like it but... wow": "Going to stick my neck out and say OUaTiH is truly astonishing. It's a Marmite movie - you'll either love it or hate it, but boy, did I love it. It's a masterclass in movie making/acting and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. A gem.", "A Once in a Lifetime Team-Up on One of the Greatest Eras in World History": "It's 1969 and the City of Angels is up and bustling being at the forefront of the cultural and social scene. Music, film, and politics are at an all-time high and amidst this heady atmosphere actor Rick Dalton is trying to get by. After a successful career in television his career is now relegated to B-Westerns with the choice of either a professional nosedive in trashy television or an equally belittling career doing Westerns in Italy. Together with his loyal and supportive stunt double Cliff Booth he navigates his way through the tangles of Hollywood in order to get a break. Little does he and Booth know how their lives will get entangled with history and how they'll unforgettably alter it.A more modest and refined but no less wacky work by Quentin Tarantino the film is all about the two lead actors. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are the twin towers of this glimpse into Hollywood and the high life in 1960s Los Angeles. Moving at a slow and languid, almost European pace this most American of films has a subtle and underlying verve and edge to it that keep it from slipping into snoozeville. Fun and memorable scenes are to be had: Bruce Lee's and Cliff Booth's fight scene; Rick Dalton's amusing and poignant conversation with a precocious and lovely child actress; Booth's tense and unsettling confrontation with the Manson family; and the final act where history is rewritten in a hilarious and moving way. Had it only turned out that way in real life. Lest you think Tarantino's mellowed or gone soft the ending will disabuse you of such notions and more than makes up to make you get rid of those stupid thoughts in your head. With an all-star cast including Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, the late Luke Perry in one of his final roles and Timothy Olyphant you can't miss this.Perhaps the final hurrah of the three A-listers, with Tarantino announcing retirement, Pitt mentioning in interviews that acting is for the young and he'd like to go behind the scenes from now on and internet rumors that DiCaprio would like to retire to an island and live the rest of his life there, \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is a warm and moving full circle for their illustrious careers. While no classic (it's a Tarantino film) this is him at his deepest and most mature. A film about actors, the industry they move in and perhaps the greatest and most pivotal era of the 20th-Century, this is one film that'll linger long after you've stopped watching and will stay with you for life.", "Brad Pitt drives, Leo Coughs": "350. Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood. A movie that answers the big questions like: What is Brad Pitt's driving skills like? Or, what does Leonardo Dicaprio look like hacking up a lung? They will be answered because a large portion of this three hour long movie is dedicated to just that. Brad Pitt driving by himself listening to the popular tunes of the late 60's, Brad Pitt driving Leo around while Leo hacks up a lung from smoking and drinking, and Brad Pitt driving while flirting with one of the Manson girls he just happens to keep running into... OK with that out of the way, its a really cool movie, cool concept and of course great acting, writing and directing. Has the Tarantino signature, multiple separate storylines coming into one explosive finale... Basically its the story of a down on his luck actor, Rick Dalton, and his stunt double/bestie, Cliff Booth, and as I said earlier, Cliff drives a lot because his bestie Rick has racked up quite a few DUI's so... and at the same time... we have Rick's new neighbors on Cielo Drive, the Polanski's, Sharon Tate coming into her own stardom and enjoying life, and we also have Cliff's solo driving adventures where he picks up a Manson girl hitching and meets the rest of the family on the ranch, all leading up to the events of August 9, 1969. A pretty sweet ride, I think its the least violent of all Tarantino's movies, but don't worry there's a bit of bloodiness thrown in to make you say, 'there it is'!

In Hollywood, Reserviour Dogs, Hateful Eight, Django Unchained, Kill Bill (count both movies as one here), Jackie Brown, Four Rooms, Death Proof (I enjoy this movie very much even if it's the last on the list)Some of my thoughts on Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood:Movie is slow paced and without a plot, which can make it seem that it has nothing going on. For example, it even has a scene with Cliff just feeding his dog in his trailer, what's the point?\nBut, it's strangely entertaining and it shows a lot about the character, without him even talking and it's also ties together for the ending, many things in the movie ties together for the final scene. That's Quentin for you.But is that it? A bunch of nothing just for some crazy finale that even has the impunity to alter history? Is that really entertainment? And isn't it a bit scandalous to make people watch crap like that? With that big draw of a name Quentin is.Well, I guess, it depends on what you feel about the whole expirence of the film, does it give you something or not? Beacuse, in many ways, it's just over all, a kind off strange movie to watch. But is there something there, that makes it worth it? I think so.To me, it's about the feeling it gives me. It has really nothing really going on, but still is filled with so much detail and well written characters. To me, that in itself, is very fulfilling and entertaining. But, I guess, it shouldn't be? But there just is some real magic to this movie. And I'm not just saying that beacuse I'm a fan of Quentin or something like that, but also, indeed I am.I just don't know how he does it. Well, sure, that he can land the greatest actors of today, and can bring in a huge budget and probably the best set workers of all kinds, is a big part of it.\nBut we already also know that Quentin can do very much on a small budget and bring greatness from any actor. That's just his magic. And what a good director should be able to do. I for example thought every actor in this movie brought it up a notch, not just Leo, Brad, Al and Margot.But this film is perhaps not even made for appealing to everyone, I even think that's pretty clear. Quentin just did the film he wanted to make. And as already stated by many, this is a love letter to the Hollywood film industry, to an era in Hollywood and a meta expirence to Quentins whole signature style of movie making. And I guess, all those things are very true, that is what this movie is all about, nothing else. And that's not something everyone will enjoy, thats for sure. Beacuse it's in a way, very self indulgent. But for me, it's a fun Quentin experience in the best way possible. Beacuse it's just so well made, so much care and love went in to this. I'm just glad I can be a small part of it, if only as a viewer. I truly enjoyed myself with this film. That's it. That it all that matters.And looking at the additional scenes on the blue-ray it's just more nonsense, but it's also just more greatness at the same time. For example, just watching Rick Doyle having a discussion with his diractor about spirit animals and Shakespeare. It all just ads more richness to what's already there, it's like it's own living breathing alternate Quentin universe of Hollywood, similar to ours, but with touches of Quentins mind. And it's just fun. For me at least. And some others. But it's not for everyone, even if they like other Quentin movies.", "Excellent.": "Excellent movie. One of Tarantino's best after Pulp Fiction. Amazing acting by all cast as well. We need more movies similar to this.", "The film Tarantino was born to make": "ONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD is the film that Quentin Tarantino was born to make and it is his Masterpiece.Your enjoyment of this film will be in direct correlation with how you reacted to the previous statement.Lovingly set in Hollywood of the late 1960's, OUATIH tells the tale of 3 performers in LaLa Land who's stories are undercut by - and eventually intersect with - the growing dread of the Hippie CounterCulture of the time and, specifically, the Charles Manson cult that would erupt in violence.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as fading Cowboy star Rick Dalton who has been relegated to guest starring villain roles on TV and is contemplating a move to Italian \"Spaghetti\" Westerns. This is DiCaprio's strongest acting job in (perhaps) his career and one that showcases his range as a performer - and he nails it. His Rick Dalton is a real human being. Sometimes confident, often times at odds with himself, and filled with self doubt. It is a bravura performance, one that I am confident we will be hearing a lot more of come Awards season.Ably counterbalancing him - and providing the strong core to this film - is Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth, Rick Dalton's stunt double, who is just trying to live day to day. He is the quintessential Hollywood/California \"whatever\" dude who blows with wherever the wind blows him - including into questionable places. This is Pitt's strongest performance in (perhaps) his career as well - and if Pitt wasn't there to provide the strength and core to this film than DiCaprio's performance would be seen as cartoonish and over-the-top, but this counterbalance is there, which strengthens both performances. I'm afraid that DiCaprio will win all the Acting Awards accolades (his part is much more flashy/flamboyant), but I think Pitt is every bit as good and I would LOVE to see his name called during Awards season.There are many, many actors making extended cameos in this film, from members of the Tarantino \"stock company\" like Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Kurt Russell and Zoe Bell to newcomers Timothy Olyphant, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Dakota Fanning and Al Pacino - all have a scene (or 2) that (I'm sure) each actor saw as \"delicious\" and their willingness to go along with whatever Tarantino wanted them to do is apparent on the screen.Faring less well is Margot Robbie in the underwritten role of real-life actress Sharon Tate who met her death at the hands of the Manson cult (this isn't a spoiler, it's a footnote in history). Her role is tangential to the main story of the DiCaprio/Pitt characters and it feels...tangential. Robbie does what she can with the role, but she is under-served by the script and direction of Tarantino.So let's talk about writer/director Quentin Tarantino. A self-described \"movie buff\", Tarantino spares no detail in showing the audience the sights and sounds of a bygone era - Hollywood in the days of transition from the studio system to a more \"television-centric\" system. His visuals are wonderful and you spend the first 2 1/2 hours of this 2 hour, 45 minute film meandering through scenes/scenarios/people that are filled with mood and atmosphere and REALLY, REALLY GREAT music, but don't really seem to go anywhere. I was (pleasantly) surprised by how little violence/blood is involved in this and I give Tarantino - the director - credit. For he plays with audiences expectations of him, this movie and the actual, real-life events of this time. While this film is an homage to specific time, it is undercut by an impending sense of doom that keeps you on edge. It is the journey, not the destination that is the joy of this part of the film.But, when all these disparate storylines/scenerios/characters and events eventually collide, the final 15-20 minutes of this film is quintessential Tarantino - exploding in violence that is horrific, bloody - and damned funny. It is an auteur in full control of his faculties and he controls the items in his \"play-set\" superbly to bring this film to a very satisfying climax for me.But...this film is not for everyone. Some will LOVE the first 2 1/2 hours and HATE the last 15-20 minutes while others will LOVE the last 15-20 minutes, but wonder why they had to suffer through the first 2 1/2 hours. For me, I LOVED IT ALL. It is one of the very best Writer/Directors of our time operating at the top of his game - driving some \"A-List\" actors to career-best performances.And that's good enough for me.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)", "This movie is so damn hot": "Once upon a time in Hollywood it's not so popular in my country because there are several movies also coming along with the action, drama, and prominent actors. I was watching this just because my movieholic friends recommend it and I am so falling in love with it!! Thanks to them, I can watch Quention Terantino's anticipated last movie before getting any retirement from box offices movies, yet TV series. So this movie is so damn-hot capturing what famous actors doing and working in America during Vietnam war and yes there are hippies who involve intimately on the main idea. I will not say why. Just watch it for yourself. Likely other Terantino's movies, there are gruesome and funny way at the same time to show the crime scene, but don't worry you never miss great acting of Leonardo di Caprio, Bradd Pitt, Margot Robbie, Dakota Fanning, and yes the newcomer from Stranger Things, Maya Hawke Thurman. Terantino also captured the filming inside the filming and I just watch without any moves, nor eating popcorn, to see the plots from the very beginning. How the good relation between actor and stuntman, why famous actress watch herself in movie, the difficulties of filming a movie on set at that time of 1970s, and what happens inside Hollywood luxury homes. This part of privacy is becoming public in this movie. I don't know if there are sex scenes, as usually included in Terantino movies, because my country has institution of censor. It sucks, yes. But I can imagine missing plots, of course, because Terantino make whole story really slight, quick, natural, and soft to be understood. This is a really comfortable movie to watch every time in every situation, again and again. I also want to appreciate the wardrobe, they are fascinating and eye-catching. So if you are going to watch this week, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is everything!", "This movie was a time machine to places I have been, heard, and lived.": "Wow. I loved this movie for so many reasons. I also hated it for bringing back the horrible memories. If you are someone who hates dialogue, you will hate this one just as you would any other Tarantino movie. I had so many memories triggered just by sounds I heard in this movie let alone what I seen.\nI will not even to attempt to analyze this movie because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. All I can say is, if you want to know what Southern California was like in the late 60s/early 70s, watch this movie. I you were alive during that time, enjoy reliving the past.", "Tarantino back to his originals": "If your looking for Tarantino violence throughout this film you will be disappointed!This is a film that centers around 2 guys on their day to day life, nothing special as most life's that people lead in 1969 Hollywood apart from 1 fateful day. The 2 pillars of a Tarantino movie are the dialogue that will question every word, either humor or sinister intent and the violence. The dialogue between characters is masterfully put together for an experience that you always expect something round the corner but the tension gathers to a head when the Manson family show up on Ricks (Leonardo DiCaprio's) quiet dead end street. The story winds until this point but if your expecting the story of how the Manson family is formed and the reason behind the choice of murders you'll be disappointed.The movie is slow, this is the only downside but can also be the main driving force behind such an interesting tale of a man and close friends life at the end of an acting career. Rick's losing his touch on action packed movies and is jumping from bit part to bit part trying to survive in the new wave of Hollywood and his own dwindling career. And the only change that should have been made during the closing parts of the film should have been Samuel L Jackson voicing the narration, from Inglorious Bastards style narration would have been a great additional and added stardom to a great cast.Both DiCaprio and Pitt turn in great performances of broken has beens and someone whos always been along for the ride, respectively. To put Margot Robbies name on the posters is a bit over kill but always have to have a leading lady. Shes turns in a quick yet memorable take on a career that is taking off for Sharron Tate. As the film nears the climax and the expectation to see those gruesome murders played out in topical bloody violence you wont be disappointed and with a twist that you wont see coming its a good way to end a directorial career if its to be believed.The film as a whole isnt perfect but a thoroughly enjoyable story of bromance and a career that can take you anywhere if you know the right people.", "Awesome film": "It really was an awesome film. Despite not having a heavy plot it was amazing to see a film so visually stunning. Had everything you expected, the cinematography, the set pieces, the homage to pop culture, the dialogue, the in-jokes. The acting was brilliant and it really captured the 1960's era. The ending was suprising but I really enjoyed it and wish it were true. Also the dog was awesome and deserves an acting award!", "Incredible!!": "This is what you can call a real Hollywood movie, especially in this era of CGI deception and waves of stupid political correctness. Not only did I feel and absorb every scene of it, but also it was like being part of those scenes and the movie itself. This is a pure art and a picture awarding masterpiece, and if it's not, should Hollywood hippies and their political correctness trend get burn till their very roots.", "Tarantino.... bro......": "Again Tarantino!!!! You effing killed it!! I watch this movie over and over. And every time I'm just in awe of how EPIC this movie is! The gimmicks. The throw back to an era that will never happen again.

Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen! I wish I could meet you Tarantino and chop it up and dissect your genius brain over a few doobies haha. Keep up the artistic work my man!!!! *we're not worthy! we're not worthy!*", "Just amazing": "Omg, this is one of the best films I've ever watched. Everything is very exciting.

RIP for all victims of the manson family and also Luke Perry.", "Just what Hollywood needed: an antithesis to 'Assembly-Line' franchise movies.": "***Secondary Spoiler Warning***Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a bold and controversial take on 1969 Hollywood, and it's one of the year's strongest films and easily the bravest one of 2019. It's part crime-comedy-caper, part-alternate-history, all-pure-Tarantino-cinema. It's not afraid to take on the Tate Murders, Bruce Lee and Charles Manson in VERY different lights to actual history, and this self-contained piece of cinema is supposed to be a meta love letter to Los Angeles; it was never meant to be taken as a LITERAL parallel to what happened back in the time period.This film's upset some people because of how Bruce Lee was portrayed in the movie and how its ending rewrites one of Hollywood's most senseless tragedies and takes on an alternate future where things are certainly brighter for Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. Kudos to Tarantino for making a movie that shows we aren't always bound by what happened in the past and that deviating futures can make for some rather witty cinema that isn't afraid to flip the bird to history for the sake of a love-letter film script that shows optimism can still exist in the dog-eat-dog world of Hollywood.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is visceral cinema that takes advantage of the alternate history deal and Tarantino will not pull his creative punches even in more modern contexts. It honours history yet it uses it to give the audience some new perspective that isn't anywhere near tasteless as some might think; it's capsule-cinema that makes its points quite clear and this film succeeds on those fronts tenfold.This film gets 5/5 stars.", "Some nice visual work, Pitt is great but movie drags on too much": "Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors but this movie lacks focus and was not well edited.First, I want to clear up one thing that some reviewers are getting wrong: this movie is not about the golden age of Hollywood. Tarantino was capturing Hollywood in the aftermath of the golden age which ended more than a decade earlier with the rise of television. He never claimed this period was the Golden Age of Hollywood.A 2 hour and 40 minute movie can work well if there is enough substance and pace but this movie lacks both unfortunately.Brad Pitt is great. It is one of his three best performances and deserves an Oscar. He and Tarantino clearly have good chemistry. Tarantino wrote True Romance, which was one of Pitt's early parts. There is one scene that parallels his role in that film.Leonardo is good but the movie spends too much time showing him doing takes in cowboy movies. Also, he appears to be overacting a lot of the time (stuttering) which I guess is how Tarantino wanted him to be because perhaps Tarantino has his own stuttering issues and wanted to reflect that in the character but it felt awkward.I felt that the backdrop of this story (the Manson family) was not the best choice for a film though Tarantino does a better job with it than I expected.There are some good cameos but they are too short. Michael Madsen, Al Pacino and Kurt Russell are all guys you would like to spend more than just a few minutes with. Bruce Dern (82 at time of filming) is also fine in a small but important role.There are a ton of great cinematography scenes in here that bump up my rating. One in particular involves Margot Robbie and the Roman Polanski character driving fast through Hollywood in a very impressive piece of camerawork.The cinematographer is Robert Richardson (Platoon, Kill Bill, Hateful Eight, JFK, Natural Born Killers, Hugo).One of the best scenes is actually a car chase from the 1967 Italian movie Death on the Run (directed by one of Tarantinos favorites Sergio Corbucci) which is shown on the screen.The time and effort spent recreating 60s Hollywood with the neon signs, the old cars, the movie posters and other set design pieces can not be understated. Credit Tarantino here for his vision as well as masterful set decoration by Nancy Haigh (Forrest Gump, Field of Dreams, Bugsy, Road to Perdition, Truman Show, No Country for Old Men).Tarantino does a superb job in picking his music. Lots of great offbeat and obscure 60s songs lift the film. There is a cool reference to the actor Edmond (Eddie) O'Brien.Overall, this is enjoyable if you can put up with the slow parts and a gory ending that is just a tad over the top as Tarantino likes to be. I think he did a great job with Margot Robbie though I think he actually could have shaved off about five minutes of her walking around Hollywood. Would Sharon Tate really go to the movies alone and do we need to see her bare feet on the seat?The final three minutes are cinematic greatness. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood needed a few more great moments.", "Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders": "My obsession with the Manson Family began during my early teenage years. In 2000, the year of its publication, I purchased \"Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders\" by Greg King from my local Waldenbooks.\nApart from some moving passages in Roman Polanski's autobiography, other writers covering the murders portrayed Tate only as THE VICTIM. King brought Sharon back to life, restored her humanity, and made the actress' story all the more tragic.\nQuentin Tarantino attempts to do something similar with his newest film, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. Though I don't usually include spoilers in my reviews, it seems almost impossible to discuss this film without revealing its ending. As with the conclusion of Inglourious Basterds, Tarantino again rewrites history. He imagines a world where Sharon Tate lived through that August night in 1969 and presumably went on to have a healthy baby and movie career.\nTarantino creates an alternate timeline where Sharon Tate becomes a star, and reduces Charles Manson to a footnote in her life, instead of the other way around.\nManson appears only briefly in one scene: an accurate recreation of the encounter he had with Tate and Jay Seabring months before the murders.\nEven so, we feel Manson's presence throughout the movie. By the point in time when we meet his followers, they're entirely under his spell. It's his warped message that spews from their mouths; his dark soul lurks behind their obsidian and LSD dilated pupils. Several innocuous scenes are filled with suspense because we know what horrible crimes these people committed.\nI loved Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, but that may be because I've gorged myself on so many books and movies about Manson over the last 19 years. I knew the name of each family member portrayed in the film and felt an overwhelming sense of dread when Tarantino cut to a street sign on Cielo Dr.\nBrad Pitt's visit to Spahn Ranch seems inspired by the sequence in Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre when the initial victims explore the Sawyer house. The Spahn Ranch scenes work better than anything in Tarantino's pseudo-horror film Death Proof.\nI don't know how someone without prior knowledge of the murders could truly appreciate this movie. I've heard many critics call this QT's most accessible film yet. I disagree. For a maximum filmgoing experience, you need to do a lot of homework before you step into the theater.\nSharon Tate is not the star of this movie, nor should she be, not if Tarantino's goal is recasting her as a human being. Tate is not a crime statistic, a cautionary tale, or allegory. Most of Tate's scenes take place over a single typical day: she listens to records, goes shopping, and talks with her friends. Margot Robbie does an excellent job as Sharon and in her best scene, visits a theater playing one of her movies and eavesdrops on the audience response. Sharon smiles as she watches herself onscreen and dreams about the successful career she's sure to have.\nI watched several Sharon Tate movies when I was younger (though she died before she could star in anything significant.) Polanski wanted her as the lead for Rosemary's Baby, but the studio made him cast Mia Farrow. Tate was talented, and just one role away from super-stardom.\nThe fictional leads of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood are Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), a washed-up actor, and his stuntman/chauffeur/handyman/shoulder-to-cry-on.\nDiCaprio and Pitt do some of the best work of their lengthy careers.\nLeo brings the same manic energy from The Wolf of Wall Street. He's a hilarious performer trapped by this persona of \"the serious actor\" and rarely gets a chance to cut loose and show off his considerable comedic chops. Cliff is Pitt's best role since Inglorious Basterds ... maybe even since Fight Club. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood will be nominated for a score of Academy Awards (as most Tarantino movies are), but Pitt stands the best chance of winning an Oscar.\nEven the smallest characters are perfectly cast. Emile Hirsch is nearly unrecognizable, but terrific as celebrity hairdresser Jay Seabring: Sharon's BFF. Al Pacino has his best role in years as a Hollywood producer. Bruce Dern is hilarious as the blind George Spahn, as is Dakota Fanning in her scene as Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme.\nEven Lena Dunham, famous for playing the representation of many millennial women, seems born to play a hippie.\nDespite dealing with the Manson Murders, it's best to go into OUATIH knowing the film is a comedy. Tarantino has crafted some funny scenes before, but this is his only movie that plays as an all-out comedy.\nSince we're listening to Tarantino-written dialogue, there are many quotable lines throughout the movie, but the ending may be the best sequence Tarantino ever filmed. The audience reaction in my theater was uproarious as if DiCaprio stepping out of his garage with a flamethrower was the funniest moment in the history of film.\nYes, in the end, DiCaprio and Pitt stop the Manson Murders. Ultimately, I believe the movie is a fairytale. That's why the film's title begins with the words Once Upon A Time ...\nWhat if someone stopped the Manson Murders?\nWhat if Hollywood retained some of its innocence?\nWhat if the counterculture movement continued into the 70s? (and Dalton thereby gives greater strength to the hippie generation he so often rails against.)\nI can imagine that some film-obsessed parent might tell this bedtime story to his children. OUATIH plays like a fable originally based on darker material, sanitized by Hollywood, and made palatable to a broader audience. The Little Mermaid didn't die - she got her prince! Tex Watson didn't kill several innocent people - his penis was bitten off by an attack dog. Susan Atkins didn't stab a pregnant woman sixteen times - Rick Dalton burned that crazy cult member to death with a flamethrower and saved the day!", "Acting, Music, Set design ....Oh MY": "I totally loved this movie . Tarantino has a flair for comical gore in all his films as depicted in the final scene :) The Characters were all believable , right down to the pithair on Pussycat as she tried to consume Brad Pitt LOL\nThe soundtrack was all music from the 60's and well placed in scenes.\nMargot Robbie was Sharon Tate , better than Sharon Tate .\nBrad Pitt was the real star along with Brandy, his dog .\nLeonardo was very good but I didn't like the booze enraged parts he played .\nFollowing the story was difficult but was pieced together near the ending .\nI appreciated the portrayal of Hollywood in the late 60's without getting involved with the rich and famous . Did I mention the sound track? LOL\nThe final scene had me on edge but calmed me down when I saw the flamethrower and realized this is what Tarantino does over and over and I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "A great movie, misunderstood in so many reviews": "I think a lot of the bad reviews are from people who just don't get it. Maybe people who went in with preconceived notions of what this would be or should be and are angry or disappointed that it's not what they thought it was going to be or what they wanted it to be. Maybe some people also went in without enough foreknowledge of the events of that time so didn't understand what was being foreshadowed and teased.This is not a historical documentary, it's not a movie making documentary, it's not a biopic, it's not the typical Tarantino psychedelic bloodbath. It's an homage to this slice of Hollywood history, the end of the so-called golden era of Hollywood, and as the title suggests, it's a fairytale. It blends fact with fiction, it blends real people with fictional characters. Throughout, and more-so towards the end it leads the viewer towards a specific event from history, making the viewer uneasy and nervous in anticipation of what is coming.... But, as I said, this is not a history documentary, but a fairytale blending fact and fiction, so maybe the viewer has been misled.Certainly, it is lacking plot; there's no real beginning, middle or end. But there isn't supposed to be. It's just a slice of history. A slice of Tarantino's idealised, fictionalised version of history. And I can understand why Tarantino fans may be underwhelmed, but he's not obliged to just keep remaking Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. It's good to see him applying his craft in other ways.Personally I thought this was a great movie. Very polished and well produced, well written and directed, great casting. It's hard to find much wrong with it.", "Once Upon a Time In Tarantino's world how the old Hollywood was": "Last night I went to see with my friend in the movie teather the new Quentin Tarantino movie Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. Since I reviewd his movie From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) which is my favorite Tarantino movie of all time. I like and enjoy this film a lot. I went watching his first movie in movie teather only for Tarantino him self and I decide to gave my proper review on the movie. I went to see it with my friend from work, my friend felt bored with the film I understood what the dircector was trying to do with this movie and what he try to show us. He bring us 50 years back in the history of Hollywood how it was and i like that.Quentin Tarantino is a brilliant, talented writer, director and actor and I respect his visions in movies so much. Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood it is a satirical, historic, comedy. Quentin Tarantino bringed us back in the past 50 years ago on 9th February 1969 and he show us how the 60's were that time in Hollywood. That year in February 9th my mom was only 25 years old at the time when this time is showed. My mom's birthday was 21st February and my mom turned 26th that year. I respect this movie so much and I respect Quentin Tarantino.I love Brad Pitt in this movie love his character Cliff Booth he was a heart of this movie and he was awesome. Brad Pitt is one of the best actors ever. He was brilliant, the actor is a professional and I absolutelly rooted for his character. Cliff Booth was a good heart likeable hero, he was a bad-ass and he wasn't afraid of no one. I think Brad Pitt is a good human being and I like him a lot. Leonardo DiCaprio was good I like him as a washed up actor Rick Dalton. Margot Robbie was excellent as Sharon Tate the actress really starts to become famous she played Tonya Harding in T, Tonya and now Sharon Tate. Margaret Qualley as Pussycat was hot babe I like her. Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme hippie was also beautiful hot babe. Kurt Russell is in here too and he is excellent.The movie tells three story's: one is about washed up actor Rick Dalton played by Leonardo DiCaprio who used to be famous actor but now he is a drawning actor, who struggles to get a better roles in Hollywood and becoming a rising star once again. The second story is about Cliff Booth played by awesome Brad Pitt who is a stuntman out of work and he is Dalton's employe and friend. The third story evolves more about Sharon Tate played by awesome Margot Robbie in which she struggles with her husband Roman Polanski and her role in her movie The Wrecking Crew (1968) watching in the movie teather.Mostly this movie is also not comic and satirical but also reflects on events that year in 1969 and hippies \"The Manson Family\" that really happened and it is important event in history of Hollywood. I enjoy this film.Quentin Tarantino really surprised me, the problems I have is the movie is too long and lacks on action, I wish there would be more action, the action is only showed in the finale. Brad Pitt was a bad-ass he beat his assailant in the phone. I want to say they are 2 movies I enjoy that also reflects the past in the late 60's and that are Almost Famous (2000) and Zodiac (2007) with Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood they are all three great movies that I enjoy. I would give it 10 if the movie had more action, that is the only problem I had with the film so 9.", "Tarantino's Love Letter to 60's Hollywood": "Tarantino is the best kind of filmmaker. He's the kind who has such an appreciation for everything that's come before him, but is always looking for something new. He infuses all of his characters with his own style of catchy dialogue, whilst still ensuring that they all have their own memorable personalities whilst assembling casts who know how to bring these characters to life. At a time when it feels far too many mainstream films have become predictable, you never really know exactly where a Tarantino film is going to take you. One moment you'll be watching a boxer on the run from a crime boss, before all of a sudden those same characters are tied up next to gimp as Comanche starts to play.It's this same unpredictability that underscores the entirety of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It's similar to Pulp Fiction in the sense that it doesn't really follow any traditional narrative and instead lets the characters drive the story as they go through their daily lives. First there's Leonardo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton. He's a TV actor who's always on the verge of his big break, but the biggest roles are always just out of reach as they always go to other contemporaries like Steve McQueen. He's still doing well in the industry with a recognisable name, a house in Hollywood and receiving offers to star in spaghetti westerns. But in spite of all his success, he feels as though his life stuck in westerns doesn't let him live up to his full potential as an actor, as just like a lot of people at the time he views the spaghetti westerns as a cheap form of entertainment. Similar to how the current age of Hollywood is coming to an end, he fears that he's no longer in his prime.He's supported by his best pal and close friend Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt. Without any stunts to do, he finds himself stuck doing chores for Rick, driving him around wherever he needs to go and picking him up when he gets down. In contrast to Rick who reaps the success of his life in Hollywood, Cliff is both the metaphorical and literal punching bag of the industry, but he's so easy going and care free that he doesn't give a damn. He's just happy to help out his buddy and is described as being \"more than a friend and less than a wife.\"Finally there's Margot Robbie playing Sharon Tate. Whilst Rick and Cliff are both starting to fall out of the industry, Tate is very much on the rise as the talk of the town as her career is still on the rise and embraces it with a very unselfish sense of joy. One of her best moments is just seeing the genuine pleasure she gets from being in the audience and seeing how much the audience is enjoying her performance.In the background of all this, Manson and his followers keep popping up throughout the film. On the one hand, their presence creates a creepy atmosphere whenever they're on screen with the film becoming much quieter, especially when Cliff visits the Manson ranch and we see them thriving in the broken set of old western shows watching his every move in complete paranoia. But similar to Stuntman Mike in Death Proof, he shows the pathetic bumbling side of these killers with the script showing nothing but disdain for both their viewpoint and their actions.Though even with the underlined bleakness present within the setting of a dying age of Hollywood history, just like the fairy tale nature of the title suggests we do get drenched in the culture of late 60's Hollywood. Stars like Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee will randomly pop up. Whenever the characters are driving the background is always filled with billboards and fashion plucked from the era. There's even a series of both real and fake radio ads throughout the film, some of which are even included in the films soundtrack to create a real radio experience.But more than anything else, Taranino's love of cinema really shines through, with characters going into great detail on how an actor like Rick would operate in this time through guest spots on network shows and the filming techniques employed by spaghetti western filmmakers. It's a true snapshot of life in 60's Hollywood and Tarantino's love letter to the final moments of Hollywood's golden age. It's also filled with so much great comedy, memorable character moments and ends on such a high note that the films 2 hour 41 minute runtime just leaves you wanting more.", "Great story telling": "I love the way this movie is portrayed and told. It's very cool to watch movies from other decades and understand how everything in the movie is dated back in the 70s. All the small details are what makes this movie good. Seeing Rick and Cliff together was always exciting because they just make a good duo. As good as the movie is there was some things I personally couldn't get such as the references and I do know some of the history behind the Manson murders but everything else just flew right over my head. Highly recommend the movie!", "An awesome and satisfying movie!": "I felt like I was taking a stroll through 1960's LA and its movie-making world and will always be grateful to Tarantino for that.I take exception to the YouTubers who state that Bruce Lee is being made fun of. They miss the point of the scene. Bruce and Cliff are trash-talking and then fight one another on the set to test/show off their skills. Cliff can hold his own with Bruce Lee. For however funny a character he is, however, poor financially, he is deadly man and not to be dismissed. In another scene, Dalton mentions in passing that Cliff was a war hero. In scene after scene, Cliff pulls off amazing stunts: cars flying off cliffs, that sort of thing. He is tough and strong.SPOILER ALERT!This is why it is believable that Cliff could disarm and kill two of the three Manson attackers while doing 75% of the job on the third. They are armed with one gun and two knives. They are physically weak albeit fueled by mental derangement. Cliff is a skilled fighter, at physical peak, accompanied by the trained pit bull that loves him and Cliff just having taken quite a bit of acid. He is a warrior. One YouTuber (with 7.2K views already day of movie opening) mentioned that he saw more violence directed against the females. Tex got it pretty bad and if the scenes against the female attackers were just a tad more protracted it is surely because, in the sad real-life situation, they acted with more bloodlust against Sharon Tate, her baby, her houseguests and at the La Bianca's.", "Awesome": "I loved the movie. Great scenes, music, outfits, cars from the era. If you love all things sixties and seventies, then you will love this. I love the references to actors and actresses of that era. I loved the story line. It all made sense to me. I hope he makes another movie like this.", "Tarantino's Magnum Opus": "Truly an outstanding film on all levels. Leonardo DiCaprio shows off his acting chops in every scene, reflecting how versatile and dynamic he is; his passion shines through. Brad Pitt is also wonderful in the film, portraying DiCaprio's loyal friend and companion. Every scene has been carefully crafted, every word carefully written, every detail has been filmed with fidelity. Tarantino personifies his love for film making in an amazing love letter to the old days of Hollywood.Reflecting on Tarantino's previous works, one can see how he arrived at this destination, and why Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a culmination of his life work. There are elements from all of his films such as Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown (especially this one), and even Kill Bill. His ability to raise tension through dialogue is paramount to his film's successes, and has become a staple.The film organically builds the two friend's relationship and characters, bringing a delight to behold on screen; there are so many other characters Tarantino is able to bring to life as well, with some of them having very little dialogue at all. He leaves the audience wanting to know more about these characters, without having to develop them. Margot Robbie steals every scene she is in, and brings about a warm innocence to her character.Overall this film is a must-see, in a time when theaters are full of remakes, reboots, and sequels; this one stands out for its originality, and a golden era of Hollywood films, much of which is forgotten today. Tarantino's love and passion for his work truly shows here, and what we receive as his audience is a masterpiece to behold, and a 2 hour 41 minute film we wish could keep on going.", "Another Matured storyline from a world class director; Tarantino!": "Wow! Just WOW!! Trailers nearly put me off and never felt like watching this movie, now I'm just in love. Witness some solid acting, performance and matured storyline from a world class director; Tarantino. Makes me love Pitt and Leonardo more. Really recommend this movie to all movie goers.. this is some Masterpiece to end my 2019 with\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe", "All Character": "I don't know what to say about the plot. It meandered but it didn't matter to me. At some point I begin to hone in on the two principle characters. Watching Pitt and DiCaprio ply their trade was masterful to watch. Neither of them is admirable. DiCaprio's character is sullen and selfish and has no self esteem. Pitt is the mad man whose skills as a stunt man have held him in reasonable stead for a long time. He is so loyal and never wavers, even when his friend has no use for him. The whole Manson thing is interesting because we get a picture of the Spahn ranch and the activities going on there. I know there is little plot but it is episodic, focusing on the two men and their crazy world.", "Very refreshing if you're tired of generic movie formulas": "This is the first Tarantino film I've seen since I'm not so good with violence, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie blew my expectations out of the water. In my opinion, it was well-shot, with great acting, and kept you wondering what's going on. As a viewer, I had no idea what direction the story was going in, and that, for me, was really refreshing. It felt like seeing an interesting snippet (albeit a long snippet) of a longer story. Personally, I'm sick of predictable same-formula movies, and I loved that I just didn't know what was coming, so I enjoyed every little bit for what it was.", "The King is Naked": "This movie is a snooze fest.\nYou have two of three good things about a movie, ergo excellent actors and good directing, but the third thing - the script is all over the place.Let me ask you something.. what was this movie about? Is it about Charles Manson, is it about Rick Dalton, is it about the 60's way of an actor's life?\nIt has no drive, no real point.Sharon Tate's character is just meaningless... you have pointless walking around with close to no lines at all in the whole movie. All that time you're waiting for some interaction between the protagonists and her character, which... basically never happens.You have the scene with Manson... which is so out of place... with no backstory, no nothing.. if you have zero knowledge about the matter it's just some dude and that's it.You have the Bruce Lee scene, which is just... I don't even have words to describe it. He's portrayed by the worst possible way (no idea why) and you have Tarantino defending the credibility of the scene by saying that Cliff is a war hero and he's a warrior. Really? Bruce Lee.. the MMA founder in a way... losing a fight to a regular Joe, even if he's military trained...\nAnd the arrogance is just... a misunderstood confidence.The hippie camp-ranch is the only scene in the movie, that provides any real wondering, suspense and actual care about a character in the film.If that wasn't a Tarantino movie and it wasn't an glory-assembled cast... the score wouldn't be more than 6.0, but because no one want's to be the one to tell the truth... that the king is naked and this movie is more than mediocre.I'd give it a lower score, but the acting in it is really good, which isn't something that can save this bunch of nonsense.", "Better Than the Lion King 2019!": "For those reading this review 20 years later (presumption IMBD is still around) let me record reality. The Lion King remake is in its second week and beat Once Upon A Time. The results are over 40 million for the weekend while the Lion King dropped 60% in one week. This is why weekend box office results are not reality. Once Upon A Time will still be seen 20 years from now and Disney's LK a mere burp that is gone! Tragically there was another shooting that is dominating the Sunday evening news tonight at the Gilroy, CA Garlic Festival. This is blocking out all coverage of Tarantino's movie and how well it did this weekend.", "Well....": "This is a film that you'll either love or hate...or simply shrug off. I'm not sure I'm in agreement that this is \"one of his best.\" \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Jackie Brown\" are enough for any one director to have created. They're masterpieces. This film is marred by an unchecked self-indulgence.What I liked:\nThe craftsmanship, the work with the actors, the infinitesimal period detail, the ability to create considerable suspense in a story that's so familiar we can almost tick off the forensics of the crime which is the film's culmination. The performances of Pitt and DiCaprio both as a team and as individuals is remarkable. It's nice to see them do very serious work that is both comedic and dramatic--and a whole lot of action. When the camera isn't the star (much of the film is done with actors alone in a scene, tripping through a sunny recreation of 1969 Hollywood), the film really soars. The soundtrack is a trip as well. It keeps the film alive when there's very little reason to be engaged other than an odd blunted nostalgia for a time in America where cigarette smoke filled lungs and penetrated clothing, women were objectified, drug use was about to flood American culture...and dog food really sucked. But by the time Feliciano's \"California Dreamin'\" hits the soundtrack, and it's late in the film, all that's come before gets infused with an immense sadness, and a dread that's not just about a crime and lost lives, but the weight of time itself.What I didn't like:\nI'm not sure why the producers indulged the length of the cut of this film. It could easily have been a 90 minute feature. We have long sequences of people driving in cars or riding on horse back or...just walking down a street. Beautifully shot, I can see why the footage would be hard to let go. But the film is unnecessarily long. There is precious little plot, which was very disappointing. Given the subject, I would have liked to see something a little less like soft buttery nostalgia which Tarantino seems to revel in. The scene at Spahn Ranch is lengthy, unnerving and prepares us for the climax. But like most of the set pieces in the film (the filming of the Western with Caleb Da-ko-ta, Sharon Tate's watching \"The Wrecking Crew\" (which is charming), DiCaprio's tantrum over not remembering his lines, etc.) they go on and on, and...nothing much comes of it. A party at the Playboy Mansion gives us little.All I'll say about the ending: This is one of the most disturbing crimes among many in American history. It wasn't just our fascination with the rich and famous, but the brutality and lack of real motive is the stuff of nightmares. For Tarantino to use it in the manner he's chosen--which of course he's free to do--puts us in the position of laughing it off while survivors of the victims are still living. It's ballsy, yes. I'm not sure it was worth risking where it leaves the audience.", "I like this QT film the best": "Out of all the Quentin Tarantino films, I like this one the best. This film is the most easily accessible, perhaps because of the pop culture references. Leonardo's acting is great, and he makes a great team with Brad. Another thing I like is the fact that it's not all about killing, but there's a really touching friendship between Leonardo and Brad. I enjoyed it a lot.", "Very Entertaining With Some twists": "I saw \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\", starring Leonardo DiCaprio-The Wolf of Wall Street, Critters 3; Brad Pitt-Deadpool 2, World War Z; Margot Robbie-Suicide Squad, The Wolf of Wall Street and Damon Herriman-Justified_tv, The Lone Ranger_2013.\nThis is Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, and I heard him say on a talk show that he is only going to make one more movie and then call it quits-for a total of 10 movies. I hope not, and people are always changing their minds, but that's what he said. Anyway, this one takes place in 1969 Los Angeles, during the end of the hippie movement and the Charles Manson killings. Leo is a fading tv action star that is looking for his next big break. Things are so bad that he might even have to go to Italy and do spaghetti westerns. Brad is his stunt double and personal driver-Leo lost his license-and his best friend. Margot plays Sharon Tate and for all those fans of her, they show clips from The Wrecking Crew with the real Sharon Tate. Margot lives next door to Leo in Beverly Hills. Damon plays Charles Manson and I'm sure that you remember what he and his Manson family did. There are lots of cameos: I remember seeing Bruce Dern, Luke Perry-in his last role-Dakota Fanning, Al Pacino, Kurt Russell and Timothy Olyphant, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few. Remember the title of the movie, Once Upon a Time...because Quentin plays loose with some actual facts, but that only makes it entertaining in my opinion. For instance, there is a fight between Bruce Lee and Brad. Near the end, things get violent and bloody-it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, remember?-but it is very entertaining with some twists. During the end credits, there is a cigarette commercial for Red Apple cigarettes starring Leo-he smoked all through the film-that is pretty funny.\nIt's rated \"R\" for language, graphic violence, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 41 minutes.\nIf you like Quentin Tarantino movies then you will probably enjoy this one. I know I did and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.", "Tarantino film on Hollywood, dreamlike, fiery... and long": "I usually see a film knowing as little as possible because I find it helps maximize the film's impact. Quentin Tarantino's latest epic recreation (and desecration) of history proves to be the exception. It pays to read up on this film's essential story especially if you had not been born yet when it all takes place.Which is not to say the film isn't arresting and captivating even if you don't know all the players. But it will seem interminable, maybe even aimless at times if you don't know where Tarantino is going. Some of it will be obvious to younger viewers, the rest of it no so much. But I highly recommend knowing the lay of the land before going to see this. Otherwise, you're more likely to feel the running time of this film.In terms of performances, Leonardo DiCaprio is quite good as a fading Hollywood actor who is grasping at straws to revive his career, but here he is out-acted by a considerable margin by Brad Pitt who turns in a charismatic performance as the actor's stunt double and driver. Margot Robbie is an appealing presence as the young, up-and-coming actress Sharon Tate. Al Pacino and Kurt Russell are both a joy to watch in small roles that add spice and backstory to the proceedings.As a director, Tarantino has a recurring issue with his films rarely getting sufficient cutting room time, and here it's no exception. Although I would have preferred a tighter film, the gripping closing act erases most of the flaws and ends on a bittersweet note, leaving us with a truly surreal film experience, that is a feather in the cap of everyone involved. All it could have used was a real editor. Recommended.", "Solid 4.5 // The Stories We Tell Ourselves": "Tarantino gifts us once again with his masterful blend of spirited characters, biting dialogue, playful self-indulgence, obsessive visual splendor, gripping tension, and explosively cathartic violence. You can feel his warm, radiant love for the craft emanating from every frame, cut, and musical cue. It's intoxicating, and the nearly three-hour run time simply melts away under his assured directorial hand. But there's something more here, too: a yearning for a bygone era, a melancholic rumination on the ever-changing times, and the reflections of an iconic director approaching the twilight of his own storied career. Tarantino seems to be exploring the very fabric of stories themselves and their roles in our lives, be it the story Rick Dalton tells himself about his own career, Robbie's Tate relishing herself on the big screen, or we as the audience viewing this very film's revisionist, fairy-tale denouement. Through story we can hope, dream, grieve, play, contemplate, yearn, process the unfathomable, and just have a good time. Thanks for the good time, Quentin.Solid 4.5/5", "Love Tarantino": "And that's it with this movie. It's Tarantino and you either love him or hate him. I thought it was an interesting character study. Almost a deconstructed Tarantino made up of snapshot type scenes which when all put together told a story. You need to always go into his movies with an open mind and a 'what am I gonna get this time'. Pitt and Di Caprio are always incredible to watch and draw you in. I thought Margot Robbie was lovely but didn't have to do too much but be the Hollywood star. In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed it and found the end and interesting 'alternative'. So if you are open to typical quirky Tarantino you should enjoy this.", "Possibly the best Tarantino so far": "The script is perfect. It cleverly uses the unpleasant threat of the Manson family, the overall strange and mystic feeling of L.A. living in their cars, and the three main characters: one describing the fear and anxiety we all have, one presenting the idealized and brave masculinity we wish to have, and one presenting the love for the art and the beauty of old Hollywood.LDC, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie all do a wonderful job, but Brad Pitt's performance is perfect. There are few scenes that are visually so perfect and intense that you will remember them for years.I went to the cinema with my teenage children and their friends. Some of them were totally confused and bored, and I cannot blame them: the movie is complex, clever and based on the knowledge of Hollywood history, that it was totally beyond their understanding.Most reviews explain that the main theme of the film is friendship which naturally is true. The deeper theme is the love for the film as an art form and the anxious pain of artists seeking acceptance. The film shows this in a visually amazing way, with a perfect rhythm and a perfect cast.For me, this was pure art. It answered questions that I did not know I had until the movie answered them. And one additional note; this is a perfect movie to explain the concept of Chekhov's gun for those young movie goers who were not familiar with the concept before.The film community has warmly accepted Tarantino which is presented in a beautiful way in the end.", "Film Buff's Dream": "\"Once Upon a Time....in Hollywood\" is entertaining as hell for an avid film buff. Steeped in the elegiac luster of an era in which the golden dreams of Hollywood were colliding with the darker, spoiled illusions of counter-culture America, the film, as its fairy tale title suggests, is one big \"What If?\" \"Inglourious Basterds\" was a \"what if\" movie too, providing an alternate ending to WWII in which Hitler is taken down in a literal blaze of cinematic might. The scope is much smaller in this film, circling as it does around a washed up cowboy star (Leonardo DiCaprio), his career stunt man and personal buddy (Brad Pitt), and their run in with the Manson gang in the days leading up to the murder of actress Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie). For all of its usual Tarantino swagger, there's an ethereal, delicate, and melancholy thread running through the middle of this film. It's at once a love letter to movies while at the same time a sad acknowledgment that life can't be more like them.I'm not big fans of either DiCaprio or Pitt, but I can and have liked them in other things depending on the movie that surrounds them. I liked them both tremendously in this. Tarantino has always been an expert at casting. He gets the right people for the right roles, and the result is that even mediocre actors give great performances in his films almost by default. The two men get the showiest roles, but it's Robbie who threatens to steal the film. She gets virtually no dialogue, but it's mesmerizing to watch her play Tate as a budding starlet new to fame, flitting around Los Angeles, sneaking into theaters to watch herself in movies, and enjoying the promise of a fairy tale career. That we know what happens to Tate in real life imbues Robbie's performance with an intense sense of tragedy. We fall in love with her a little bit, but don't want to because we know we'll have to say goodbye to her.Except that we don't, which brings us to the film's finale, the one thing I really had a problem with. I didn't have a problem with the story; in fact, I thought the idea of what happens was pretty hilarious. But the abrupt transition into stomach-churning violence really turned me off and took me out of the world of the film. Unlike in his other movies, the violence is fairly short lived and it doesn't ruin the whole experience, like it did in \"Django Unchained\" and \"The Hateful Eight.\" But it feels so exploitative, and I was disappointed that Tarantino felt the need to end such a beautiful little movie with his trademark violence-as-porn. And worse, it's played for laughs. The audience I saw this with (though admittedly small) was yucking it up, which made me queasy.Still, my reservations about the ending aside, this is Tarantino's best movie since \"Inglourious Basterds,\" and really the first one since maybe \"Jackie Brown\" that I felt wasn't just a parody of other directors' styles.Grade: A", "Love this movie": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it really is great if you are in the mood to take a trip back to 1969 Hollywood.The setting is amazing; Tarantino beautifully reconstructed this 1960s Hollywood paradise, while also establishing the disturbing presence of the Manson family cult in the background. Interesting juxtaposition for sure.The soundtrack is on point, and the leading characters are really fun to watch. Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) is an emotionally unstable alcoholic TV cowboy with anger management issues, who hates hippies and loves margaritas. Meanwhile his best friend Cliff Booth (Pitt) is a wise-cracking, ass-kicking, stunt double with a heart of gold. They make for an awesome duo.There are also some great performances from supporting actors, such as Margot Robbie, Julia Butters, and Margaret Qualley.Overall this movie is a charming, offbeat period piece that combines fairy tales with reality, drama with comedy, and even some horror in the mix.", "Hollywood 1 - Manson 0": "In his ninth film Tarantino still does what he does best, tell a great story. Even if you are not familiar with the Hollywood murders of 1969, the slight irregularities of fact and fiction will not stop the happenings on 10050 Cielo Drive from becoming a part of your ride.Meet Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) a stereotyped bad ass actor and his buddy and stunt double/wife killer Cliff (Brad Pitt). As luck has it Rick gets a lucky break in doing Spaghetti Westerns in Rome, meets a girl buys a condo and decides Cliff and him must part ways. This is not before a drunken bender on August 8th 1969. Intertwined in this tale we meet Gypsy, Sadie and the friends of the \"Manson Family\" at their ranch as they are told to kill \"the pigs\" by the leader Charlie Manson. Very little time is devoted to this but you are made aware all the same.I will not give away the twist as it has to be seen and enjoyed as its pure Tarantino. As far as the acting its Brad that takes it by the horns and gives an exceptional performance. Leo is solid too with many gripping moments. Cameos of Kurt Russell, Luke Perry and Al Pacino were also good.It was great that Tarantino gave the family and Charlie nothing and gave August 8th 1969 back to Hollywood.", "I Have Thought About This Movie Every Day For The 2 Weeks Since I Saw It": "So, I just found out that this movie was almost three hours long. I was enthralled the entire time. If you aren't a fan of of a slow build done by a master filmmaker, then you will not like it. It was amazing. Every moment was fascinating. The characters were incredibly well developed.The only thing I would say... If you are a bit younger and don't know anything about the Sharron Tate then you should do a quick google search.", "Tarantino's best film": "I'm not a Tarantino lover. I like a decent amount of his films (I thought that Resevoir Dogs, Kill Bill 1 and 2, Jackie Brown and Inglorious Basterds were just OK). I am, however, a film lover. I love the cheesy Spaghetti westerns of the late 1960s. I love a good cut when I see one. I love a great set-piece. I love Hollywood mythology. This film is a love letter to all those things and more importantly, it's a love letter to cinema. A love letter to the art of film. It's kaleidoscopic, enthralling, ugly and beautiful in tandem. After finishing this film you will shout to the skies \"that was a good MOVIE!\". I missed that feeling and now my soul as an artist feels rejuvenated. I feel like I've just witnessed a historic piece of art.It's truly a cinephile's film. If you ever frequent this website, watch films semi-regularly or like a good work of art, then please SEE THIS MOVIE!", "About the most satisfying ending ever.": "Everything works here, the story, the acting, the setting. Characters both likable and unlikable. The story completely absorbs you, and you hardly notice the length of the film. You think you know whats coming next, and kind of dread what you think the ending will be, but when it does you are blown away. The small late show audience was cheering, and I was pumping my fist saying Yes! Yes! I cannot endorse an evening of cinema more strongly.", "Once upon a \"might have been\"": "One could call this a satire and homage to the last hazy days of a bygone Hollyood. Others may call it, \"what might have been.\" Tarantino returns to form for this tale. My only criticism would be that the scene setting takes a little too long, but makes up for it by immersing you in the era with sights and sounds of 1969-1970.\nThe pairing of Pitt and Di Caprio is excellent and Margot Robbie is stunning as Sharon Tate. This is the best film I've seen Di Caprio in and he brings his own bit of Hollywood to it, playing a sensitive type who is told he's going to be a 'no-one' one day by Al Pacino so sets out to make sure he doesn't. Pitt as his driver and stunt double is excellent, bringing the same comedy and gravity to the film as he does in Inglorious Basterds.\nMy favourite scene is where Kurt Russell stops a fight between Bruce Lee and Cliff, which is so well choreographed.\nThe film is similar to Pulp Fiction in essence and certainly the funniest. The acting is superb and story telling is brilliant. Tarantino continues his eloquent scripting using some excellent dialogue.\nMargot Robbie plays her part well and I really loved the story of this character; the reminiscing and aspirations of Sharon are set to a backdrop of almost naive stardom.\nSometimes you'll wonder where the story is going, but it moves well and has good pace, which is deliberate so the needs of the script can be absorbed. I mean, all of Quentin's films lean heavily on narrative and dialogue which is part of his distinguished style.\nI've actually rated this film higher than Pulp Fiction, mainly due to the comedy; to reiterate, Pitt and Di Caprio are so well cast and the chemistry is right there and spot on. They are the Jules and Vincent of Hollywood, except they're not- they're the Cliff and Rick in a version of Pulp Fiction in another universe.\nI pray you enjoy the film for the next one Tarantino makes will be his last. Or will it....?", "Style can only carry a film so far": "I really didn't expect to dislike 'Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood'. It's a Tarantino movie so it is still well above the average film, at least in terms of quality of production. But to say it was a disappointment would be an understatement. All the great things that are apparent in every Tarantino movie were missing, at least for the first 2 hours of the film. The problems stemmed from the fact that this was a character study, rather than being plot driven. Tarantino is usually so good at combining the two together, so for him to completely ignore one of those elements is a real shame.The film is almost 3 hours long and it simply doesn't have the pacing to justify that. I lost count of the scenes where, after they'd finished, I thought to myself how easy it would have been to leave that on the cutting room floor. So many scenes were setting things up for later in the movie, which is fine and has to be done, but none of them had any creativity to keep them interesting. We simply had to listen to long boring conversations.Finally after a couple of hours a very intense and well-crafted scene involving Brad Pitt's character at a ranch happens. It's arguably the best scene in the film and all I could think was, where has this been? There is no doubt that Pitt and Leo DiCaprio carry this film big time. Without their acting talents this film would have been unbearable. Pitt especially was the best thing this movie had going for it. The film does its best to redeem itself in the final half hour or so, by then the damage was already done. This is my least favourite Tarantino film to date I'm sad to say.", "Disappointed": "Well I was expecting great things from an amazing cast and director but found it was majorly disappointing... very very slow and ridiculous violence at the end... waste of 2 1/2 hours of my life.", "Head Over Heels": "Last weekend I saw \"Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood\". I am a big fan of Tarantino's films but this was so much better than even I had expected. It is much more nuanced than all his previous work but just as bold and interesting. It has just about the best and most immersive vibe, visually and narratively, of any contemporary film I have seen. To find anything equal or better in that sense I have to go back to movies like The Third Man, Rumble Fish, Runaway Train, or Terrence Malick's work. The last surprise this pleasant at a film I knew I would like going in was Blade Runner 2049. Just one non-spoiler spoiler. You are going to love the ending. One of these days they should finally give Brad Pitt an Oscar. Maybe this will do it. Incidentally, you could watch this just to see Dakota Fanning as a frightening villain.", "A 60s nostalgic slow burn with all the Tarantino magic fans know and love.": "Amazing recreation of classic Tinseltown (and surrounding areas) a glorious but turbulent city, with fame and fortune, heartbreak and misery. It's classic Hollywood with a dark side. Don't expect a 100% factual representation of the story, Tarantino took creative license and as a Tarantino fan (and Angeleno) I can't recommend this movie enough, you will not be disappointed.For those who can't stomach violence, disapprove of jokes regarding racial & gender stereotypes, I would not recommend this movie.", "Once Upon a Time...": "I usually love Quentin Tarantino films and was looking forward to this one...but left the theatre very disappointed. This film drags on and on for over two hours before finally giving the audience one scene at the end that is satisfying. Worse than being boring, the film is immensely bereft of the classic Tarantino dialogue that makes his films so special. In two hours and forty minutes I can only name one scene that was worthy of being repeated. Just a mess of fantasy that is not worth the time devoted to it in my opinion.", "We need a new rating approach for Tarantino's movies": "Some movies when you give them score. Tarantino's movies should be rated in a range that has minimum 10 score, yes, 10 as a minimum. If this movie should be rated, 10 stars will not be enough.", "Waited for it to start": "I kept waiting for the movie to start.... There was no story not even till end.... And margot robbies character was absolutely pointless...expected better fron quentin and this star cast.", "Art can be fun!": "Haven't had this much fun since Pulp Fiction. Finally some terrific entertainment that isn't a comic book character or a lot of cgi. I'm rating it 10 because I can't think of a way it could have been better. There wasn't a minute in this film where I wasn't interested, engaged, and eager to keep watching. It's punchy, funny, LA glamourous, colourful yet noir-ish, the violence is gutsy and visual but it's Tarantino, so not just a run of the mill punch up shoot out--always a surprise and enough of a twist that you can't help laughing. The editing is an excellent juxtaposition of scenes and images. Lots of recognizable memories if you're a boomer--you'll be going \"oh yeah, that's right!\" But more than that, it has characters who are interesting, not just cutout action figures, but human beings, from the lead roles to the bit parts. This looks like a movie where the actors sincerely got into the spirit--art can be fun!", "Just not feeling it": "I enjoy history. I enjoy seeing it replicated upon the screen. I just didn't gain any enjoyment viewing this picture.The cast is fine - particularly Brad Pitt who I feel has got better with age. The cinematography is good and I genuinely felt I was observing a slice of the late Sixties. The problem, however, is the dialogue. It is yawn-inducing. The pacing is slow and the story is incredibly uneventful. I also found the narration a strange addition too.Just to highlight how tedious the picture is, I honestly cannot recall any dialogue. The only 2 scenes that I can remember - from the 150 minute running time - is Bruce Lee and the flamethrower. That's it.The picture is certainly worth 1 watch; but it is unlikely I will ever revisit it for a second viewing. I'm just glad I watched it online because I would feel disappointed if I had paid for a cinema ticket.", "Not Pulp, but arguably Top 3 of Quentin's films": "I thought Quentin had lost the plot with The Hateful 8, and some sections of Django. Those overrated meanderings were a far cry from his best, which is as good as anyone's. OUATIH is a welcome return to form like a second cousin to Inglorious Basterds. It won't be for everyone, but for movie fans it is a love letter to 1960s Hollywood. Not Pulp, but arguably Top 3 of Quentin's films. 9/10.", "2 movies in 1": "First thing I haaate long movies. Over 2 hours and I lose interest so it was trepidation that I approached this. However moments in and I knew I was going to love it. A love letter to tv and cinema. DiCaprio ( I better disclose that I think he's best living actor) as a TV star and Brad Pitt as his stunt man. The soundtrack is awesome and the attention to detail on costumes and the sets incredible. Two separate stories emerge though plot is slim. DiCaprio's fading career and Pitt's interaction with a group of hippies who are encamped on an old film lot. There's a dog in this who's the best in film since Lassie \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0153. There are lots of real life characters played by actors in this the main one Sharon Tate played nicely by Margot Robbie who's unfortunately not given a lot to do. Loads of fantastic cameos too. So far so good and so un Tarantino but then a couple of hours in you do remember it's a Tarantino film. Cartoon violence that seems totally separate to what went before. Like two totally different movies!!! ( and I loved both) All performances top notch. Hope you enjoy it and I'm off to listen to the soundtrack now!", "Before Watching: Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019)": "\"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" (2019) is a fun comedy and the ninth movie of Quentin Tarantino. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Once Upon a Time is not all too similar to Tarantino's latest movies, like Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained. Instead, it is more of a cozy, atmospheric movie that doesn't rely on any dramatic plot events to carry the events forward. This brings a very authentic and charming feeling that although pure brilliant, again, isn't like the protagonist blood mayhem we've gotten somewhat used to - but it neither needs to be.That being said, there are some classical Tarantino vibes present that could shock viewers not used to his other works. There are some brief but crude sexual references, brutal violence once conflict approaches, and a lot of drinking and swearing. Thanks to the direction and construction of this movie however, it never feels forced, which lessens its potentially negative impact.Finally, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is fundamentally a comedy. It is funny, and a rather gleeful and clever way of funny. Do not take this movie 100% seriously all the time, instead just relax and drift away with the charming 50's and 60's atmosphere so expertly crafted.My personal grade: a cheerful 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.", "Nothing but the best from Quentin Tarantino once again.": "With a cast of insanely talented actors giving excellent performances, a deep understanding and love for the time period and Quentin Tarantino's signature style of writing and directing covering every single frame, \"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" is both a love letter to the golden age of cinema and an all around fantastic movie. Unsurprisingly, Quentin Tarantino's style of filmmaking will confuse those unfamiliar with his tropes, but for those who remain patient and invested in the story for long enough, the payoff is huge.", "Movie Review: Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood": "I'm going to state my bias right here, right now: I absolutely love Quentin Tarantino. There are a handful of film-makers that I discovered when I was first developing my tastes in cinema (Edgar Wright, Wes Anderson, Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, Stanley Kubrick, The Coen Brothers and of course Tarantino), these directors will always have a place in my heart and as a result I may be easily persuaded to recommend their latest work. That being said Tim Burton's Dumbo isn't exactly going to be making my top 10 this year so don't take too big a pitch of salt when I tell you that I might have a new best of the year contender.I would be interested in how this film would be received by someone who is unfamiliar with the previous 8 (or 9 depending how you count them) Tarantino films. I think a large part of my love for this film is down to how it messes with the standard formula of a Tarantino movie while still offering many of the trademarks that have made his style iconic, however I have seen many critics and fans saying they were disappointed in the film for similar reasons. Either way it is clear that this film can only be read effectively through the eyes of the kind of person who knows what like a virgin is really about, what a quarter ponder with cheese is called in Paris and can recite Ezekiel 25:17 by heart.This is probably the slowest film that Tarantino has brought out to date, large amounts of screen-time are dedicated to watching the characters drive through the painstakingly real looking sets or to fairly mundane conversations with no real baring on the overall plot. This has been an issue I have seen in many reviews but I have to say that it didn't bother me, the cast are fantastic and so even the most pointless dialogue exchange feels engaging and as I mentioned before the attention to detail in the set design as well as the wardrobe makes every scene a treat to watch.There are a couple of scenes that have caused controversy for this film. In the interest of keeping this spoiler free I will not go into detail here but lets just say that I don't see what the problem is.I do want to talk briefly about the ending, I will try to keep this as vague as I can but if you really want to go in blind then ignore the next paragraph.A lot of people have compared this film to a fairy tale, given the unexpected and cathartic ending as well as the 'Once Upon a Time' title. For me this film reminded me more of a well told joke. A great comedian is able to keep their audience engaged for a long period of time while telling a seemingly mundane story, they will throw in little jokes and go on funny tangents only to come back at the end with the punch line. At the end of the movie when the sub-plot comes in focus and everything goes full Tarantino everyone in my cinema as laughing hysterically. I think that is what Tarantino wanted and what many critics are missing.Ultimately, this a really great film. You should go see it.", "Another Tarantino winner! [+82%]": "As is the case with most Tarantino flicks, the first half of Once Upon A Time in Hollywood sets the tone and builds the characters up nicely while the second half puts them in seemingly messed-up situations (in this case, real-life) with spectacular grindhouse results.The film revolves primarily around Rick Dalton, a Hollywood actor who believes that his career is experiencing a downward spiral, and Cliff Booth, his friend and longtime stunt double. Tarantino has painted both characters, played by two of Hollywood's biggest stalwarts DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, with sufficient shades/strokes for viewers to want to get invested in their lives. He attributes a backstory to the two characters and carefully places them next to the Polanski residence in 1969 LA. What a masterstroke!I read somewhere that the climax was what Tarantino wrote first and that shows! What a brilliant stretch of events the last 20 minutes is! It's everything you'd want in a Tarantino film by default - screenplay pulpiness, grindhouse feels, adrenaline-pumping action in a limited setting, Robert Richardson's captivating cinematography, and a rock & roll soundtrack that kicks major butt! Like in The Inglorious Basterds, he twists events to suit his wicked fantasies and comes up with a very intriguing ending.What Tarantino is a master at, is developing characters through well-written scenes. For instance, if you look at Rick Dalton's interactions with his 8-year-old co-actor Trudi Fraser, it sheds significant light on his breakdown (and the eventual boost of self-confidence). Another unmissable scene is Cliff Booth's visit to the Spahn Ranch and the subsequent events that transpire. One also cannot forget Booth's brief altercation with Bruce Lee, in a stretch that takes the realism/fiction blend one step too far. Margot Robbie, as Sharon Tate, is commendable! She doesn't have many lines but the short scenes that she features in, speak for themselves.In any case, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is a must-watch. It comprises all the 'isms' that viewers associate Tarantino with. The retro-yet-contemporary feels, the fantastic-looking late 60s sets, the pop-culture references (and in fact, plenty of connections with Tarantino's own flicks) - it'll all leave a mark in your head! Tarantino has matured incredibly well and his solid crafting skills continue to impress. When you have a cast and crew sharing Tarantino's vision, the results are (obviously) stupendous!Verdict: Must-see!", "Pains me to write this": "I LOVE QT films and couldn't see this movie fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was so boring. Did anyone edit this film? Leonardo's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Brad Pitt. Nothing happened what so ever. The dialogue was not clever. The movie never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of other movies being made. People driving in cars. Bare feet over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently.", "Tarantino is the best storyteller": "It was a great movie regardless of the fictional ending that it came with. It will take you straight to that beautiful 1960's era. It was a completely different vibe. The direction, setting and presentation were all on point!Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were fantastic. The whole movie belongs to the two of them. They looked natural in their respective characters and their acting was wonderful! Although this movie is a fictional take on the Manson murders which in reality were very painful, it was able to showcase that 60's era very well. Tarantino's imagination is great and he's the best storyteller.This movie is particularly for fans of Hollywood or generally fans of the city of Los Angeles.", "Scam rating": "This movie is a debacle a comp[lete waste oif your time Taratino was 6 in 1969 and knew nothing of that time .\nTarantino has nothing to say\nThis is a mindless empty sensationalist farce camp crap and a waste opf your time and money.\nTarantino is all reputation but of no subsatance whatsoever", "So ?

Overall great movie, would watch again.", "Fast Forward >> >>It's official, QT is a HAS BEEN": "I can't believe this movie is nominated for eleven academy awards. People, don't waste your money... There is absolutely nothing to like about this movie, it was a waste of my time, and now I am wasting my time writing this.\nI honestly cannot fathom the high ratings either. One noticable thing in this movie is that the camera follows the actors for the full length of their drive or walk. They forgot to cut the movie, guys! I mean, boring does not cover it. The script, dialogue, the plot (which plot?) and the missing humour that maybe could have saved 10% of it, it is all rubbish. The acting is wasted in this. I fast forwarded, That is how bad it is.", "Great film!": "Having only seen a couple of Tarantino's films, I knew to expect something f--ked up in this one, even though I knew from reading that this wasn't going to be a one of his typical films.The first 2 hours of the film is good, but doesn't feature the typical QT violence or action. However, the last 37 minutes does provide what QT fans like myself have been waiting for.The visuals were good, the violence (even though it's only 1/4 of it) was ace as hell! The acting & dialogue were also pretty good! The film had quite a few bad arse moments in it! The only issues I had with the film was it dragged, it was too long winded & also the film could've befitted with more violent QT scenes.Overall this film was pretty epic, aside from the lack of QT violence! 9/10", "WTF?": "2.5 hours of no plot whatsoever, then 5 minutes of gratuitous gore. Waste of time.", "Near perfect": "This movie is so good, the acting, the comedy and the action. DiCaprio and Pitt both do amazing jobs at their role. The movie also gives a good feel of the time period. It also gets intense scenes. Such as Cliff on the farm meeting George. That whole scene made me sit on the edge of my seat. I didn't know if Cliff was going to die or not. The best scene of the movie was at the end. Where the people working for Manson invaded Rick Dalton's house. Then Cliff and his dog brutally killed two of the people. Then the other crashed through the door where Rick pulled out his flame thrower. Such an amazing scene, with great gory violence. Tarantino is an amazing director and makes another great movie.", "Spitting fire and taking names!": "This is a wild west history of Hollywood in its former glory during the roaring 60s, with Leo the Kid grabbing viewer attention in \"pillage the village\" style. A true treat for the hungry cinematic intellectual, on the hunt for some true style.Our good friend Tarantino did grow up and this is some gourmaine adult humor we are talking about now.", "My second favorite Tarantino movie": "Although pop fiction is my number one favorite Tarantino movie, but the ending is my all-time favorite, the only thing I don't really care for is the fight scene between Cliff Booth and Bruce Lee, it's because of Shannon Lee criticizing the movie, but other than that, this movie kicks ass.", "A classic Tarantino movie": "It seems this film is controversial in the post MeToo times. The portrayal of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and the violence towards women have offended a number of people. I must admit that I expected the Sharon Tate story to be the central to the plot of Once Upon a Time in America, but it is really a side story. It will be interesting to see if the role gets fleshed out in a directors cut. As with most of Tarantino's movies the violence is extreme and comic book like. The violence isn't really targeted towards women. There's just as much violence with the men. You can imagine people being upset by the lack of violence against women if he would have taken that approach.I really enjoyed the movie which is really all about the friendship between Rick (DiCaprio) and Cliff(Pitt). Rick is the television actor with Cliff being his stunt double. They have reached the point in their careers where they are struggling to maintain their status. As ever with Tarantino the dialogue is excellent and it is obviously an age he looks back fondly upon. Both DiCaprio and Pitt seem to be enjoying their roles and for me it is a return to form for Tarantino. Well worth a watch.", "OMG this is so boring": "I love Quentin movies. Hateful eight is probably my favourite and was looking forward to what I assumed was going to be another classic. I was wrong.I get that this is playing homage to the 60s film era but its so boring...There just isn't a story... Leonardo looks dashing as usual and maggot looks beautiful but that's about it...I've seen more in depth stories on QVC...", "One can only wish that night could ended like this.": "Quite simplistic in narrative & plot structure, yet one of the most beautiful films of Tarantino so far, IMO. His passion for cinema, particularly a bygone era of Hollywood shines here throughout every frame for his top notch cinematography & spot on set designs & costumes. The A-list cast did a terrific job in their respective roles who carried the film remarkably all through the way till the end.Tarantino wonderfully captured a challenging time of a fast changing Hollywood with a pretty simple tale at the center where a struggling actor & his stunt double trying to survive & find their place in the industry by keeping a beautiful friendship at core. On the other hand, there was Sharon Tate; a stunningly glamorous actress & the wife of an acclaimed director as their next door neighbor, enjoying every bit of success at the same time. But this is not only just a film about a particular period of an industry or how artists from different state of success meet each other through a dramatic chain of events...it was more like a lover letter to the late 60s cinema & its artists through the eyes of a film aficionado who give us a warm & beautiful taste of an alternate reality at the end; where Tarantino as the savior, rescued his dream girl from the evil clutches of fate.Personally I used to have a keen interest about the Sharon Tate murder & watched a number of films & documentaries about the Manson family & this specific story. And as being a fan of both Polanski & Tate, it shocked me terribly when I first came to know about this vicious crime. On that regard, I'd like to thank Mr. Tarantino for not glorifying the violence of those brutal murders on the screen this time and very much appreciate the way he reimagined it instead with his own engaging style of cinematic interpretations. Found the ending quite moving actually...one can only wish that night could ended like this.", "Best movie 2019 so far better than endgame": "Love this movie especially the ending oh my god the ending is a masterpiece", "Exuberance": "This movie is somewhat different from the rest of Tarantino movies because of lower tension over the story (excluding the last 20 minutes). But it is so full of fulfilling scenes and wonderful performances that the end of the movie does not seem to be relevant. Di Caprio's performance is captivating, because he is not a character who is exactly a likable hero, but it he kind of becomes from the second half of the movie. Bred Pitt has a timeless, story-less character, and there is just enough of him in the movie. And eventually, the most fun part is that as usual Tarantino gives a satisfying ending. He loves it. It's kind of fair. It's like ice-cream and coffee after the dinner - kind of satisfying evening.", "Oh, it's gold and an apt representation of what hollywood wanted to look like": "You look at this, and see a bit of it and realize that there is no real movie is going on here, it's just some people struggling with their insecurity and the constant fight to remain relevant, where Tarantino shows the side of hollywood that's quite hollow and simple compared to the extravagant hopes that everyone generally have from them.To see leonardo feeling insecure about his position in the industry and an then trying to prove an eight year girl that he still has balls in him to act good, to see Pitt realizing his life and his somewhat strange faith towards his boss is really what makes this movie apart from the gazillion others who try to show something that's entirely false and just looks good.It's not the best tarantino movie out there and it doesn't try to be, and that's the reason of the ultimate success of this film. I loved every frame of it and wanted to see more, specially I felt some scenes to be abruptly cut when they could have been just a tad bit longer but also understand that the film was already quite long.", "I hope Tarantino donates his brain to science": "SYNOPSIS:\nA re-imagining of the Manson murders while paralleling a story focused on Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), an outdated actor who is trying to find his way back to being on top of Hollywood cinema.REVIEW:\nA long movie. A long movie for sure with some fat that could be trimmed. This was a very divisive film and I can definitely see why. I did enjoy the film for the most part, there was just a whole lot of \"wtf am I watching?\"POSITIVES:\nDiCaprio is so good in this. Truly a great year for film and the Best Actor category is so strong it's not even funny. Some actors who weren't nominated had winning performances in other years. Brad Pitt is another one. Fantastic job. He deserves to win and I'm sure he will. To everyone saying \"it's just Brad Pitt being Brad Pitt\", and no one can play that cool ass stunt double better. He's never won for Best Actor playing the cool guy so let's give him this one cause damn was he good. He's the first non-superhero that I watched and was like, \"wish I was that guy.\" The guy was poor living in a trailer and the shadow of Dalton and I wanted so bad to be him. There were many memorable scenes like all of the scenes where Rick Dalton was shooting a film or show and the scene with Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) was simple and purely awesome. The last 30 mins of this film were spectacular and you won't convince me otherwise.JULIA BUTTERS:\nYea... had to make her own section this. BEST. ACTING. EVER. *clears throat* okay, moving on.NEGATIVES:\nToo long. Enough said on that. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) almost felt not necessary. Someone sparked the idea that possibly we were following her for an excess amount of time to try to diverge the audience into believing we were going to see the real outcome of the horrendous Manson crimes, but to that I say Tarantino is known to flip the true story into what we all secretly cynically desire would've actually happened. So, yes, have Sharon Tate in there, but let's not focus too much on that. I understand this was a love letter to Hollywood, for me I didn't connect much with it so that fell flat. Unfortunately, a lot of the dialogue didn't carry me throughout the film like most of Tarantino's films have in the past.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis film had a lot of very funny and memorable scenes, however, the runtime really hurt this film and I felt that a lot of the dialogue in this film couldn't help carry me through. Absolutely, stellar acting all around and great directing. Great film at time and sorely lacking at other times. 6.7/10.", "Mediocre": "There is a fine line between artful pulp and gimmick and unfortunately this was too much on the side of gimmick. On top of that it was overlong and never really got off the ground despite having plenty of time to do so. Average.", "Self-indulgent": "Quentin Tarantino is like a self-indulgent author who writes for the pleasure of writing - pens sections not relevant to the book, composes anticlimactic chapters, twists history - readers be damned. This upon a time, despite vivid illustrations, it duds. 6/10", "A Bonkers Tarantino Fairy-Tale with Golden-Age Hollywood Nostalgia": "A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden Age-Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of stellar performances, & wild final act. 9.4/10....Review: 1960's: Manson x Golden-Age (leading into Renaissance/New Age) Hollywood. That was the tall order we were promised by legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino for his 9th outing, one made even more tantalizing by the trailer & announcement of a once-in-a-lifetime cast from Leonardo DiCaprio to Brad Pitt to Margot Robbie. After such inimitable masterpieces as Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, Kill Bill Vols. 1/2, Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction, the film world's eyes were all on July 25th like the premiere of any blockbuster film in its namesake ritzy town's backdrop, and Tarantino delivered yet again - Oh *boy*, did he deliver. A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden-Age Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of sensational performances, & wild final act, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is one of Tarantino's greatest films ever.Nostalgia to Hollywood's Golden Age with plenty of Easter Eggs and eulogies to filmmaking. What's easily the highlight of OUATIH is its golden paean esteems and invocation of the best of Hollywood's history through every sensory way imaginable. It's truly like taking a joyride through the annals of film archives and will smack a goofy grin on any cinephile's face for its ~3 hour time period that flickers by in a flash. More classic film posters, TV serial snippets, lunchboxes, vinyl-pop, and radio-ads than can possibly be mentioned with meticulous attention to detail and period-authenticity make for a sensational trip through the escapist fare of moviemaking's best era. It even features clever fourth-wall-breaking/meta references to the artform showing (with classic Tarantino whim, wry humor, and unmistakeable energy) the process of filmmaking with everything from messed-up lines, cuts, shot-reversals, and replays of scenes as people come together across specialties to try to create filmic products that stand the test of the time.The cinematography to soundtrack to location settings majestically paint the glamour and ritzy lives of the rich and famous in Hollywood Hills' idyllic settings as promised - only to be shaken up by the events of its equally-brilliant screenplay. Paralleling all this settings-glamour is an equally dazzling display of storytelling with rich characters who make the film. The screenplay is masterful - this is pantheon-level filmmaking here - juggling 3-4+ storylines simultaneously with ease before uniting them all for the wild signature final act as promised by QT's filmography. We are taken through Hollywood studio backlots with insecure has-been movie star Rick Dalton trying desparately to save his career, a juxtaposed-rougher lifestyle for his sacrificial stunt-double Cliff Booth, trophy wife/model Sharon Tate jumping between romances in LA-superficiality fashion, and a Manson cult arc creeping under the surface like a serial killer slipping between the cracks.The performances. Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely (predictively) steals the show as lead with one of his most hilarious and out-there performances to date; Pitt is equally as infectious in personality as support with an intriguing exposure of the double-standard in film treatment between the people just \"reading lines other people wrote for them\" and those doing the dangerous stuntwork behind-the-scenes (also makes an iconic buddy-duo that needs its own couple of films with these two legendary actors tossed together for an extremely unique, refreshing mix!), Margot is a nice soothing juxtaposition storyline undeniably a treat for the eyes while also given a mini-romance arc with potentially-catastrophic results, and there is not a weak link to be found in the rest of the cast/cameos as the story escalates and twists until the final act as bravato-filled, wild, and bonkers as could only be found in a Tarantino film.The final act. One of the craziest final acts I can remember of late - only really rivalled by other Tarantino films as a signature big boom ending characteristic of his filmography, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood ends with a tremendous bang that adds triumphant final punctuation to this bonkers fairy tale set in the nightlit views of the motion picture capital. Immaculately tying all story threads together while also leaning heavy into its Manson arc with his cult trying to break in and kill some socialites in the Hollywood Hills on beckon-command, they meet a much different ending than they anticipated for MAXIMUM drink-spitting entertainment value - with everything from flamethrowers to butcher knives to dog-attacks to sleeping pills to incessant yells. What's even more impressive in the finale and throughout the film is that Tarantino absolutely silences any of his (imbecilic) critics/detractors claiming his films have \"too much gore/cussing\" (he's stayed true to his promised style of brazen irreverency since PULP FICTION, fools) by shockingly having almost none of what was perfectly licenseable to have given it's a film set around the events of the Manson murders: gore and violence. Instead we are just taken on a ~3-hour road trip amenable to all discernible tastes through masterful characteristic Old-World storytelling any real film aficionado can bask in the glory of for hours.Minor flaws in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood include a comparatively-smaller role for Margot Robbie than was expected and Manson arc I wish was a little more pronounced/fleshed-out. Margot is only really shown in glimpses and not utilized nearly to the full of her considerable acting talents, and we only get one actual glimpse of Charlie Manson (a perfect look-alike as well nonetheless) and few glimpses of his cult until the spectacularly-entertaining ending I really wish had gotten more screentime for its massive EV-value. Even a couple of slasher scenes or teases placed throughout would've done the trick, perhaps in place of some of the nostalgia-leaning in the first act that's undeniably enchanting but might've been better served for a bit more balance....Overall, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a masterpiece and one of Tarantino's best films to date - an incredible feat given his already-illustrious filmography that keeps getting one-upped every outing he gives. A bonkers fairy tale in classically-Tarantino fashion with pure nostalgia-hued Golden-Age Hollywood homages, soundtrack as provocative as its brilliant screenplay, star-studded cast of sensational performances, & wild final act, OUATIH cements Tarantino as easily one of the Top 3 Directors of All-Time in my book, as well as one of the greatest auteurs and most influential/inimitable masterminds the medium has ever seen.Overall Score: 9.4/10", "It's not for everyone": "I can completely understand why some people didn't like this movie. It has a slower pace then we are used to seeing in a Tarantino movie and it takes it's time to get where it's going. I really loved the slow burn. I liked having the time to take in and appreciate the cinematography and acting, which were incredible. Fantastic sound track too.I was familiar with the story surrounding Sharon Tate and had a certain idea of where the film was going to go, I was wrong of course. That twist was so beautifully done and makes complete sense of the title. I thought she was portrayed with such sensitivity too.If you are a fan of Classic Hollywood movies I think you will really appreciate what Tarantino has achieved here. I will definitely be watching or again soon.", "Some of his finest work to date": "This is some of QT's finest work he has ever produced. The reviewers leaving 1 star claiming it is boring and nothing happens probably enjoy trash like the Avengers. This is a masterful slow burn build up to a big crescendo and is essentially a fairytale set to the backdrop of the Hollywood hills. The soundtrack is incredible and weaved in cleverly via the radio of Rick's Coup Deville. One reviewer claimed it was a pointless movie full of scenes from other movies. These scenes help to build Rick's character and display the existential crisis he finds himself in and craft his rollercoaster mental state. They are not pointless, merely the IQ of the viewer was too low to appreciate their significance. The movie is HIP, COOL and beautiful and expertly crafted. Some describe it as self indulgence, it couldn't be further from the truth, this is a love letter to a by-gone era and those who lived it. I don't expect your average millennial to appreciate much less understand this movie. I personally thought the ending was wonderful and how he dealt with the matter of Sharon Tate was actually touching and heartfelt. Finally the bleeding heart liberals moaning about Bruce Lee's portrayal are honestly pathetic. I love Bruce Lee and his movies and I found the scene to be hilarious, this is Hollywood, its supposed to be fun!\nI'll finish with saying, this isn't a movie for FILTHY HIPPIES! :-)", "At last a return to true form": "I finally got around to watching Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood, and was richly rewarded.Tarantino is an odd fellow, from my perspective, he entered the world of film with such a bang, and initially could seem to do no wrong with his unique brand of ultra-violence, whip-smart dialogue, great ensemble casts (often resurrecting floundering careers of formerly popular actors) cool nostalgic soundtracks, and mastery of post-modern intertextual references to pop culture that often became pop culture themselves. His first three films were as near to provocative perfection and for me as it is possible to be, culminated in his best film to date, in my humble opinion, Jackie Brown.Tarantino then took self-reflective, introspective self-indulgence to the ultimate extreme in the utterly ridiculous Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2. To many it was a bridge too far, to me it was one of the funniest things I had seen at the cinema. Still, even though I enjoyed it at the cinema, unlike his other previous work I rarely watched it again even though I bought it on DVD.Then, with Grindhouse, although enjoyable, the fake trailers were the best thing about the whole project. Inglorious Basterds was hit and miss, some great sequences, some that I cannot even remember now, and once again, even though I own a copy, I have never rewatched it.Django Unchained was excellent, and I was really glad I went to see it at the cinema, but once again I have not rewatched it since the first time, and for me, although it had some bright points, the Hateful Eight seemed like one long in-joke that I didn't get, and especially a waste of 70mm print given that most of it happens in a cabin.So, to be honest, I have been underwhelmed with most of Tarantino's output since Jackie Brown. Perhaps this is unfair, none of the films I have mentioned are bad, in any way, but given I know just how good Tarantino can be (as proved by his first three films) I couldn't help but feel disappointed each time I watched one.So, to be honest, I was not expecting much of this. I was totally blown away. Other reviewers who saw it earlier than I did have outlined much of the details about plot and post-modern references to film and TV cultural products, so I won't dwell too much on that stuff.For me this is a film about what Hollywood was originally famed for being; a factory of dream and fantasy. That this is set at the true end of the Hollywood studio system and the beginning of a time when most of the big Hollywood studios started to be owned by other much bigger multi-national conglomerates whose primary source of income might be selling tires, or soft drinks or insurance etc, and therefore the importance of Hollywood film production to those companies was significantly less than it had ever been. 1969 was a time when that original dream was being carved up and sold to the highest bidder.It was a perfect fertile ground for rebels of all sorts; directors, producers, owners of pornographic magazines, actors, musicians, artists and cult leaders...Every significant character in this film is most typified by their dreams, fantasies and hopes. Rick Dalton (DiCapprio) dreams of recapturing his faded star-status, and of giving a good performance (as well as dreaming about what might have been had he got his big break instead of Steve McQueen). Cliff Booth (Pitt, with a name that is perhaps partly a reference to the terrifying villain in David Lynch's neo-noir masterpiece Blue Velvet, especially given the rumours of how he might have killed his wife and gotten away with it) dreams of actually being significant in some way (fantasising about handing Bruce Lee his own arse in a fight during down-time on a shoot; yeah, right!) Sharon Tate (Robbie) dreams of living the dream of Hollywood, of truly making it and being famous and adored (her disappointment at not being recognised at the theatre when she goes to see her own film, and her delight at the audience reacting to her on screen) her star is rising as Dalton's fades. The Manson 'family' dream of changing the world.In reality, maybe all of their dreams are facile, without hope of coming true, and ultimately unsatisfying if they did...but then again, this is a fairy tale. They all get a (kinda) happy ending.As pointed out by other reviewers on here, this film works best if you know about the violence and murders committed by the Manson 'family' that lead to the death of the heavily pregnant Sharon Tate.It makes the final section incredibly and uncomfortably tense, in a masterful demonstration of Tarantino's power as a director. I was becoming so tense watching the end of the film, that I felt compelled to jabber nervously at my wife the sequence of events of that fateful night before we see them happen on screen (even though she is fully aware of them). When suddenly Tarantino starts altering history, it comes as such a relief to the tension built up that the violence Pitt and his Bull dish out comes as a glorious, euphoric release, I laughed so hard I think those around me thought I had lost my mind. It was such a lifting of the anticipation of knowing what is about to happen, that the otherwise horrific ultra-violence seen in graphic detail on screen becomes almost hilarious...and I think that is entirely the point. For a split second Tarantino allows us, in revelling in the fantasy punishment of Manson's puppets, to share a small sense of what they might have been feeling in their twisted acts that fateful night, whilst at the same time allowing us to metaphorically wash our hands of the guilt of exalting in such violence because, after all, the bad guys are getting punished here and the good guys are given a fantasy second chance at continued existence.That it is the same trick he used in Ingloious Basterds is entirely the point, it is signposted to us massively in the clip from Rick Dalton's trashy film shown earlier which replicates the use of a flame thrower to kill Nazis, the fact he still has the flamethrower in his tool shed which we also see earlier, and the fact that Brad Pitt was in both history-bending films.One of the things that I couldn't stop thinking about is the notable absences from this film. Firstly, Charlie Manson, although he is seen very briefly, is conspicuous by his absence, but his imprint is very definitely felt (once again especially if you know some of the background of his cult) and so too is Tarantino, not popping up in his usual cameo role, and also not stamping this film with his usual brand of razor-sharp dialogue, constant ultra-violence etc.\nIt occurs to me that Tarantino could be drawing a comparison between himself and Manson, Manson famed for manipulating and controlling others, and directing them from a distance to take part in acts of horrendous violence and torture, and so too, as a film director, does Tarantino. Their purposes might be different, and their canvas might be different, Tarantino uses the artistic expression of film making, Manson used people in an evil and warped perversion of artistic expression. Here his ludicrous motivation to his followers 'do something witchy' is given the derision it deserves, and burned at the stake...well, pool.And if the Manson 'family' dreamed of changing the course of history, well, in this film they got that wish, although perhaps not in the way they intended. And in the end this film has the ultimate fairy tale ending, a happy dream that everything ended okay, and that the '70s wasn't born in quite the same violent and horrible way it was in reality. Instead Tate gets to carry on her career, presumably saving Polanski from his own self-destructive sexual exploits (some sort of hidden message for Weinstein there, perhaps?), Dalton gets to be the star of his own story, use his skill set (limited though it is) and make friends with his neighbours and Pitt gets to finally be someone worth talking about, and proves his value as a man, a human, a friend.I will, as I have done with everything else he has made, be purchasing this (albeit on Blu Ray this time) and this time, I will definitely be watching it again and again.", "Tarantino brings 1969 back to life": "I think this is the first film I have ever rated 10. But there can be no other rating. I am not a Tarantino fan, but after seeing this, I will reevaluate his other films.First: Unless you are extremely familiar with the Manson family and the murders of Sharon Tate and the other poor souls in the house with her on that horrible night, you should carefully research the story, otherwise, the movie won't have the impact it should. Second: If you are not familiar with pop culture from the late '60s, it would be wise to learn about the popular TV shows, songs and movies from that time. Without that knowledge (and probably a fairly extensive knowledge at that), this movie also won't have the impact it should.For me, because I am from Los Angeles, and was a teenager at the time the (real and/or imaginary) events in this film took place, I was riveted to the screen. But even if I didn't know the world of L.A. that well, this movie is still entertainment in its highest form.DiCaprio and Pitt are, as I believe Tarantino said, the most exciting male duo on the screen since Newman and Redford. As fading TV star and his stuntman best friend, Leo and Brad are, in a bizarre way, very much like a gay couple, without the sex. Brad (as \"Cliff\") seems totally dedicated to Leo (as \"Rick\"), and their relationship goes beyond friendship, venturing into brotherhood and even substitute spouse. There isn't a second of their time together that you don't buy.And Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate? It's uncanny how she seems to capture Sharon's natural joy, sexiness, beauty and optimism. You fall in love with her in a nanosecond. She was letter-perfect in her performance.But there are many, many performances that are absolutely A+, from Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a real person), the ancient owner of the forgotten Western movie town where the Manson family took up camp, to Julia Butters as \"Trudi Fraser,\" reminiscent of other brilliant child actors such as Natalie Wood and Margaret O'Brien.There are tons of delicious moments, cameos... and shocking laughs. I say shocking, because in the midst of horrific violence being carried out, you will find yourself laughing because the set-ups lead to such rich pay-offs. I do not like, condone, watch, enjoy or appreciate violence, but in this film, because of the era and what the story required, it worked, and Tarantino knows a punchline and the audience will not be disappointed.I will not describe the story points here, because the film must be seen (but honestly, only if you have done your research and come prepared with the knowledge required to appreciate it). I will say that I did not see the surprise ending coming and, for someone who lived through that time and felt the shock, sadness and anger that anyone would have about the fate of poor Sharon Tate and the other souls lost in one of the horrific crimes of that era, there was a sense, even if for a fleeting moment, and even if only imaginary, that justice was finally served.A triumph on all possible levels.", "Too long": "Not Tarantino's best. Not a cohesive underlying theme to the story. Way too much sensationalism. Not believable.", "INCREDIBLE": "After just watching it I need a day or two to process everthing. I loved it and every minute of it. I'm sorry some did not enjoy this remarkable film but it was a brilliant cinematic experience I've had in a very long time. I just simply wanted to leave this: Brad Pitt's character is a legend!! I found his scenes the most enjoyable and feel like his character stole the whole movie. I've seen decades of both Pitt and DiCaprio and I have to say this was a genuis casting decision and even felt DiCaprio went places in this vehicle that I havent seen him do before. These two are my two favorite and what a phenomenal experience!! Holy shit I must process", "QT; one of the best but this needs to be put to rest": "This film is crowded with an incredible talented cast and seemed prior to attempting to watch it, with a director like QT and the time period and plot, it couldnt possibly go wrong. Maybe even be up there with his best. However, a half hour into the movie, I began noticing that while the camera work and directing is the DNA of Tarantino, the writing was off. I kept hoping things would tie together or he would instill his story devices that make him so brilliant, but to no avail I was terribly disappointed. Though, that's not to say that there is absolutely great acting throughout this movie but it is very underwhelming in my opinion and should have been capable of much, much more! I've never not enjoyed a QT film and sadly this is the first. Everything seems so scattered and even the infamous amazing dialogue was not up to his high standards. This just missed its mark but I would still suggest anyone still see this movie and experience it for the great directing and acting.", "Nothing short of a Masterpiece": "Quentin Tarantino burst into the Hollywood scene in the 90s with Reservoir Dogs, but jumped into the stratosphere with Pulp Fiction, and two decades and a half later he is still directing masterpieces like this one.This movie has an astounding ensemble cast, it's a love letter to old Hollywood and the glory days of western tv shows, and 50s series.It is also embedded to the core with Hollywood references, and it manages to center the main story around one of the worst crimes in American history without it ever feeling exploitative.Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Margaret Qualley, and many others bring their A-Game into a film that feels like a 70s drama, but plays like a Tarantino quasi-comedy.Tarantino might have been wrong when he wrote that line of dialogue in Pulp Fiction, wine does get better with age, and although Pulp Fiction might be for many people his pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, his later movies have been more matured when it comes to filmography and spectacle.I give this film 10 out of 10, because I can't rate it higher.I hope Tarantino bails on his promise of only making ten movies, the world of cinema is better with such a passionate and talented director giving us amazing masterpieces like this one.", "Tarantino is back with a BANG!!!": "I'm going to be straight up; this movie was everything I expected. I highly enjoyed the slow burn to the character development & plot telling. I knew this movie was going to be on a whole different level to Tarantino's usual standard film making / directing. I personally loved the dry humour and wittiness that shone through the 2 hour & 41 min running time. Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth stole it for me, I was massively impressed as I haven't seen him characterise a person so well in a long time; It almost seemed effortless to him, as if he breezed through it quite naturally. As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he did not disappoint. I did not expect anything less. His character, Rick Dalton, actually had me in stitches. I believe he gave the audience exactly what they needed to see; his character was so wallowed in self pity you couldn't help but laugh at him. I took great pleasure in the different stages of this movie too. It was refreshing to thoroughly get to know the characters on screen before Tarantino took it to his level of madness & chaoticness. In my opinion, you have to really appreciate the direction of this film & have a great involvement with its visionary & cinematography; If you wanna have a trip to the '60s then this movie can definitely transport you there. What I realised about this production is that you need to be able to sympathise & have that likability to a character to be able to take on the full advantage of what this film gives off. There are so many scenes that I look back on that made me chuckle. Also, I would like to mention that even if Margot Robbie didn't get as much screen time as portraying the gorgeous but unfortunate Sharon Tate, I think it worked very well, as the movie wasn't about her, but yet, it was her era and I liked how Tarantino slotted her into someone else's story, gave us a look in on her golden year, & even gave her the send off she deserved at the end of the movie.", "Brilliant. Cool. Powerful. Tarantino is the king!": "Tarantino is the king! Here it goes another masterpiece. Don't be impatient and enjoy the movie. You'll recognise the Tarantino of always (brilliant, brutal, cool and stunning) towards the end of the film. As somebody said over here: fasten your seat belts and see if you are brave enough to watch the whole movie without covering your eyes (I wasn't). Leo & Brad are absolutely stunning. Masterpiece. 10/10", "Who needs a plot?": "There was only one movie last year that left me with such mixed feelings and that was the Suspiria re-imagining. Prior to that, and now this, I can't remember the last time I felt so 50/50 on a film. These are rare cases.I imagine this will be the most polarizing film of 2019 - to me, I feel like it's designed to be.First, the positive: It's very hard not to be entertained by the acting chops of both Brad Pitt and The Nardo. They bring it as hard as they always do, and their characters offer just enough to separate themselves from the rest of these guys' back catalogue. These two manage to take what is basically \"not a movie\", carry it, and keep it thoroughly entertaining. Pitt's character was my favorite, and just got better and better as the movie played out. Tarantino clearly put a lot of thought into the set pieces and design, and some of the editing, to really transport back to that 1969 vibe - it's effective and usually a lot of fun. All Spahn Ranch-affiliated characters were the most exciting part of the film, specifically one prolonged sequence that occurs at the ranch itself. That was just about the ONLY scene in the movie that provided any real tension or \"purpose\". Finally, some things occur in the final act that are undeniably satisfying and electrically entertaining - this scores the film a bit of redemption, but 10 minutes cannot save a 160 minute experience alone.Then, the not so positive: first and foremost, there is no plot. Yeah, an aging actor is insecure that his career is starting to tank... but, most scenes have little to nothing to do with that, and there is literally no other conflict in the entire movie. And it's not some surrealist, abstract, atmosphere-driven experience...it's just meandering, throughout. Still entertaining the whole time, just...meandering. Next, Margot Robbie may as well not be in the movie at all. She has maybe 5 or 6 lines, across maybe 4 scenes, and her longest scenes are, in my opinion, some of the most purposeless and ineffective scenes in the entire movie (her watching her own movies in a theater, alone, for a long time?). Kind of a bummer when you have someone as talented and beautiful as Margot Robbie, playing someone as legendary as Sharon Tate, and you get just about nothing from it. Next, there is NO reason for this movie to be 160 minutes long. We don't need 3-minute establishing shots, watching people drive cars from one place to another, as the intro to EVERY scene, especially when what we're prefacing are scenes like Brad Pitt getting up on the roof to fix an antenna in real time... for no reason. It reminded me of the panning shots of San Fransisco in The Room or of the creek in A Talking Cat?! - you could cut out a solid half hour of establishing shots and unnecessary long shots and you'd still have the exact same (plotless) movie. I could go on.I certainly consider myself a huge Tarantino fan. The Hateful Eight was the first movie of his that I did not enjoy. This was an odd one, and overall I would say that I liked it, but I can't imagine having this script and being like \"okay! That's it!\" - we have all the money, all the power, and all the A-listers to do WHATEVER we want with this movie, but THIS is what we're gonna do! Perhaps though, that is exactly what's going to make this special in the long run.", "This film takes me back to this time and place": "This film really took me back to the time. I was living out in LA around that time for about 6 months and a lot of scenes in the movie took me to that time when I was there. I was only 20 when I went out there in 1968. The hippie craze was going full blast and I had a great time there. Unfortunately after the Manson murders took place everything changed sadly and peace and love were no more. This is another masterpiece of Tarantino. I am an avid fan of his movies and always give the majority of them a 10. He put some incredible actors in this film. I know that he spent 5 years to write this originally as a book but decided it would be better as a film.", "What was and could have been": "This is a movie of what we wish had happened, not the reality. Loved all the old Hollywood scenery. If you are a film buff or a fan of old tv shows you will love it! The attention to detail is impeccable. My son loved it, too. Tarrentino honors so many actors that were great but you don't see today by giving them parts. Brad Pitt was incredible, terribly understated as an actor. I believe there was even an homage to another Tarrentino film, Iinglorious Bastards. Terrific film.", "Godawful Crap": "There's really nothing more to say.", "I am bewildered by te genius of this film": "I won't make this too long, but this movie was great. Not good or amazing, but great.First I didn't get it completely, because I didn't know about the manson murder that happened in real life. But after researching it, everything clicked and I just thought: WOWThe title made it also so amazing. In real life they were going to murder Miss Tate, but in the story they see Rick Dalton and decide to go after him. With Cliff and his dog Brandy handling the two inside and Rick torching the other they stop what was supposed to happendix in real life. Not until the end where the title \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" comes up is when you get it.Like all our fairy tales, the original stoties were much more gruesome and didn't always have a happy ending. Like red riding hood oribally ended with the wild winning and eating everyone. But our fairy tales give it a happy endingThis is our fairy tail where Tarantine gave it a happy ending like with all the original fairy tales. That's what make's this movie great. I don't even know what genre to put this in.", "Tarantino is a Film Genius": "I just saw this film and was blown away! This story is a sharply directed and written cross between a love letter to the late 60's in Hollywood and a buddy film. The cinematography is gorgeous and all of the colors are incredible to look at. The non-linear storytelling and narration we all know Tarantino does best is at the top of his game. I absolutely loved the scenes that were Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) acting in the movies he stars in. They were extremely intense or hilariously funny but so enjoyable. That being said, what really puts this movie ahead more than any other is the performances from DiCaprio and Pitt. They are both hilarious and then in the next scene they are making you tear up or feel their emotions at a whole new level. DiCaprio has to be an actor playing an actor who occasionally is playing a role in tv shows or movies which is extremely difficult and he blows it out of the water. Pitt plays a mysterious and hilarious stunt man who is cocky but deep down he will always be Rick's friend. Alright academy awards let's bring home the bacon with this incredible piece of film.", "I can see why some might not like it but I was enthralled": "To me, this film is a culmination of all of Tarantino's past films blended together. This is a film about films, a film about why we make films. It's a long movie with constant movie references and tributes and if you don't pick up on any of these things while watching you probably won't enjoy the first 2 hours. This is a dialogue driven, hangout movie paying tribute to Tarantino's film ingredient roots.\nHowever, if you're a film fanatic, a history fanatic or a film history fanatic this movie is what you've been waiting for. This film has so much going for it and it is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had at the theater in a long time. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt give two of the best performances in their long careers.\nDon't go into this movie ready for action at every corner. You'll get your action. Until then relax and get transported back to 1969.", "Tarantino shows his love": "The only point I wanted to make (other than the fact that boomers are going to get this film far more than younger viewers - especially the one-hit-wonder soundtrack) is that the two main characters are surprisingly nice people. Wonderful movie.", "2 hours of mellow boredom for 15 minutes of gore": "I've expected more from Tarantino than having to sit through 2 hours of Hollywood retro everyday grind, to come to a sudden finale for wake-up. Both DiCaprio and Pitt have more talent than to be wasted this way. Well, things change.", "It's official, old buddy, you're a has-been.": "'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' isn't a good film. It's dull, far too long, very baggy, and quite simply a bit boring on the whole. Even in its best scenes, where it's a little more interesting, it's never truly engaging and this is primarily because the whole affair is rather aimless, seeming to not have a real purpose. For a film with a run-time of 161 minutes, it's extremely light in the story department and what is happening is hardly interesting at all. Every beat of the narrative is pretty much in the trailer (minus the stuff in the final third), which is very surprising as it seemed like the marketing department must have been keeping something hidden to deliver a better experience. Surely then, the character work is excellent and Tarantino's signature dialogue keeps things interesting, right? Nope. While DiCaprio and Pitt are at the top of their games, the actual characters are very uninspired and the dialogue is pretty standard. It doesn't help that there is hardly any development in that department, either. Rick Dalton has a very tiny arc, even if it's basic and just told to you in a clunky third-act exposition dump, but the rest of the characters stay the exact same throughout, which obviously makes things far less compelling. Sharon Tate is hardly even in the picture, which is very bizarre considering that Tarantino began the screenplay about her. She's just used as a tool to try and build tension in the audience as they anticipate what is going to happen to her. This links with another major issue with the piece. It's a half-fictional, half-based on reality narrative about a made-up actor and stuntman that's telling the story of Sharon Tate and the Manson murders. It doesn't sound like that's a good mix, and that's because it isn't. It simply doesn't work. Supposedly, this is Tarantino's love letter to Hollywood, but it just seems like he hates it and everybody in it - just look at the Bruce Lee scene. The way that Tarantino portrays, and even treats, him is horrendous, which is very strange considering that Lee was clearly an inspiration on some of his earlier films. When asked about this scene, Tarantino has said that he accurately portrayed Lee because that's what he was like in real life. Tarantino didn't know the guy so there's no sure fire way of him knowing that and he just comes across as arrogant himself when he refuses to accept that he's in the wrong, especially when people who actually knew Lee in person have spoken out about it. The final act of the film has been much discussed and, for the most part, has been heavily praised. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but let's just say that it's dealt with in typical 'Tarantino' fashion. However, where it goes is very predictable - I guessed what would happen correctly after seeing the trailer - and it's actually dealt with in pretty poor taste to the point of being rather disrespectful. I know what Tarantino is trying to do with it, but the message is rather messy and the final result rather uncomfortable. Look, while the whole thing is pretty bad, it's not completely without merit. If anything should be being praised about it, it's definitely the performances. They're fantastic all round, with DiCaprio and Pitt truly giving almost career-best ones, but unfortunately that's not enough to make this thing worth recommending. The other great aspect of the film is the production design; you truly believe the 1960's Hollywood aesthetic. Again, though, that's not enough to overcome the bland screenplay and total lack of narrative investment. People are saying that it's Tarantino's most emotional movie to date, but I felt absolutely nothing for its entire duration. Although, after thinking about just how much of a waste of time the experience was, I find myself rather irritated. I guess that's something. It's certainly a polarising picture, one that Tarantino has said he wants people to discuss. I doubt he meant discussing how disappointing it is though. 4/10", "Lucky for you, he's got a spare. Fix it.": "The life and times of a Hollywood actor and his stunt man during the late sixties.I enjoyed it, but as with several Quentin Tarentino movies it reflects his pop culture obsessions and you need to at least have an interest in the subject matter before committing two hours and forty one minutes of your time to it.The plot is very focussed on fictional characters Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth. Lots of scenes that involve portrayals of real life stars like Sharon Tate and other personalities help develop the main characters and establish the era. Largely in the background, but quite effective, is the looming threat of the Manson family which hangs over everything like a creeping death.I found Dalton to be a fairly interesting portrayal of a male star in a difficult mental state due to being past his prime. It helps if you can appreciate this mind-set as it is important for what happens to the character. We mostly see him playing his current role and reflecting on his career. I enjoyed it because I am of a similar age, with an interest in filmmaking and pop culture history. Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic at portraying this emotional character, whose hopes and dreams are fading, in a number of private and professional situations. There are some great moments where he depicts an actor acting badly and a few scenes later acting brilliantly.As a contrasting character, Booth is a seemingly laid back, almost hippie-like, action man who has lived the life that Dalton pretends to live in the movies. There are a lot of scenes that are juxtaposed between the lives and personalities of the two men. Booth is written and portrayed as a likeable, cool hard case with no real ambition or major hang ups. Brad Pitt's performance is a perfect foil for DiCaprio and the chemistry between the two works well.There is a good sense of humour to the script but, as ever, comedy is in the eye of the beholder. A lot of laughs in Tarentino's movies come at the misfortune of the characters. Scenes involving Dalton's neurosis, such as his exchange with the young actress Trudi are quite memorable, as is the banter between the main characters. The infamous Bruce Lee scene is pretty funny to me, as he is portrayed as a caricature like those seen in shows like 'Extras'. I found it quite reminiscent of the humour in the episode 'Ross Kemp & Vinny Jones'. I can also understand why members of Lee's family took offence, but it's clearly a light comic moment in movie full of dark humour and not something worth taking too seriously in my opinion.For me, easily the best scene is Booth at the Spahn ranch. It has brilliant tension and an atmosphere about as creepy as I have ever seen in a Tarentino film. It proves you do not need Marvel type set pieces and CGI to make characters look cool and a bit heroic.Everything shown in the scenes with Tate, Roman Polanski, Jay Sebring and other characters build towards the events of August 8th 1969 and a typically Tarentino style ending. It all works well for the Hollywoodised, mythological, hallucinogenic theme that runs through the story.Visually it is incredible. Dialogue dominates lots of scenes and the camera generally shows something interesting as the characters talk. Scenes that are more visual, tell the story wonderfully with camerawork, editing and physical performances. Remarkably, it actually feels like images of tinseltown have been captured during a bygone era as opposed to the actors being on a period set or in a studio backlot. Everything from the costumes, colour grading, location backdrops, soundtrack and props are spot on in a number of different locations.All supporting cast members are superb, particularly Julia Butters, Margaret Quarry, Dakota Fanning, and Bruce Dern.For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.", "His best film.": "The anticipation was just painful, it was so painful waiting for the story to unfold only because you know the dread that is to happen or not happen. The movie comes full circle in a beautiful way while encompassing all aspects of the time period.The film gave me such a warm feeling as everything ended so perfectly, but in all reality we know the horrible events that truly unfold.The happiness and pain this movie made me feel all at once is why I give it a perfect rating.", "A lot of nothing": "Glad I didn't have to paid, other than Starz, to watch this movie! I usually like QT movies, but this was really bad!", "Slow starter but once it kicks in, the film delivers": "The first 2 hours while still great are a bit slow more akin to Jackie Brown than other Tarantino films. It has great moments including everything with Rick Dalton and his acting career, the Bruce Lee scene and the ranch scene. However towards the end when the cult invade Rick Dalton's home that's when we get one of the best sequences in any Tarantino film. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio give terrific performances, Margot Robbie feels a bit wasted and was used to throw off audience expectations as to what would happen with the Manson cult.", "Fantastic Fantasy Restoring Sharon Tate As A Human Being": "All in all, I loved this movie as it's about my era, the Sixties. I'll let other people go over the detail. What struck me was that in fantasizing the ending and letting Sharon Tate live while doing in her murderers, not only is Tarantino giving us a wonderful fantasy to live out, but in the process he restores this lovely young woman. Think about it, what does the name Sharon Tate conjure? Torture and murder. Tarantino attempts to rescue her from that fate and give us back us a decent young woman, who although not a brilliant actress, deserves to be remembered as more than a victim. Over the course of the last 50 years her murderers have taken on mythic proportions while Sharon has been reduced to Poor Sharon. Tarantino instead gives us a more accurate portrait of a squalid band of murdering psychopaths, who in this version of history, get what they so richly deserved, while Sharon goes on to a real life. Although I've disliked most of Tarantino's movies, he does much to redeem himself with this wonderful homage to Sixties Hollywood. Thank you Quentin.", "Slow, boring, pointless, meaningless. More boring than Jackie Brown.": "This is a fictional story about a real life event with a twist. It is a homage to Hollywood nostalgia and movie making. However, for people who do not live in Hollywood or work in the industry, it is rather pointless and meaningless. It could have been made so much shorter (it is too long). Many people, for example the neighbors, did not need to be in the movie because they did not interact with the main characters and did not advance the plot. It could not even be considered a character study because the characters were rather shallow and not particularly likable. It was more boring than Jackie Brown. It did have good cinematography though.", "Quentin Tarantino's fantasy film": "This is a film which is designed to show off creative directing technique. Tarantino paints such a beautiful image of 60's Hollywood in the form of Sharon Tate, and using his own imagination, presents Hollywood how it would have been had his version of events unfolded. The film is representative not only of 60's Hollywood, but the survival of it, at least from the perspective of the director.Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are two variable fictional characters inserted into a backdrop of 60's film culture and Manson family madness. In this sense, they represent Tarantino's imagination and how Hollywood may have been had they been real people.Much of the film has amazing cinematography and great costume design - it is like being transported back in time into a believable 60's Hollywood era. However, as unique as it is, many people also criticise Tarantino's apparent imagination, which is depictive of over the top and unnecessary violence. I personally did not find it to be Tarantino's most violent film, but it's also not his best. It did feel somewhat lengthy, and, despite for some good scenes throughout, it did not feel very dialogue driven like many of Tarantino's previous films. Brad Pitt and his dog definitely stole the show in the end, and it is fair to say Brad Pitt was in his best form in this film.", "Do your homework": "Ok, If you are not well versed with 60's movie and TV pop culture, then you will be turning to person next to you who is trying to enjoy the movie asking them who is that? ask me how I know. The time frame this takes place is right in my retro wheelhouse and I loved the nostalgia, cars and the soundtrack. My advise would be to just go along for the ride, be the fly on the wall or the guy sitting in the back seat taking everything in - don't overthink just enjoy the journey.", "A time bomb ready to blow up.": "The lack of plot forces Tarantino to keep us engaged through his sheer talent as a filmmaker. Thankfully, he has talent to spare. Tarantino makes wait for the bloody conclusion we know he'll give us, making us follow and hang out with the characters as they deal with their everyday life and their own personal issues. Sometimes it may feel like it's going nowhere, until we get there and we discover that the destination is both amazing and surprisingly touching. This is the kind of film that you're not sure what to think of when the credits roll, but the more you think about it, the more you realize that you had way more fun than you thought at first. It's not Tarantino's best, but that's only because we expect certain things from him; we get them, just in a way he's never done it before: detached and restrained. It feels like a ticking bomb; at times he ticking takes so long, it could drive you insane, but when it finally blows up, the damage is unbelievable.", "Tarantino has lost his touch - not just as a filmmaker": "This movie has you sit and wait for something to actually happen for more than 2 hours. The end is kind of satisfying, i have to give you that. But it cannot make up for more than 2 hours of boredom and tarantino's attempt to drag Bruce Lee's reputation through the dirt.What bugs me the most is just that, the portrayal of Bruce Lee. Some - even the actor that portrays Lee - justify this scene by saying that tarantino wanted to humanize lee. But that's a huge load of BS... humanize Lee to super-humanize brad pitt's character?\nSorry, that just doesn't make sense.I have been a tarantino fan since reservoir dogs and did even forgive his weaker movies. But after seeing once upon a time i can say: tarantino has lost his touch. Not only as a filmmaker.1. The first 2 hours are painfully boring. Plot-wise literally nothing happens. 2. There was no need to (try to) kill an asian-american icon's legacy. There would have been many possible ways to achieve what tarantino was aiming at. But not only did he pollute Lee's reputation, but also did he do it in the worst way possible - by ridiculing him, as hollywood has done for many, many years and decades with asian actors/roles.So from now on i will no longer be paying a single more dime to watch any tarantino movie.And to anyone involved in this movie and who has approved the aforementioned scenes, i can only say: shame on you!", "A truthy Tarantino film, with a little bit of fact and a lot of friction. 75+%": "It might be an idea not to see this film with a knowledge about its subject matter because even though I avoided reading reviews about it, I did manage to pick up that it did deal with historical people and events. That affected how I related to this film. What might otherwise have seemed a meandering story about two people in the TV industry in Hollywood turned into a countdown (dates regularly are displayed on the screen) to when that known history would intersect with the (presumably) fictional characters who are the subject of the story (hence my slightly low score for it). It helped that my knowledge of these notorious historical figures and events was vague enough so as not to know when that coming together of fiction and history would happen. Perhaps most people would be in my position: the names of the historical figures ring a bell but the details of the events are forgotten or not even known.With all that being said, the film centres on Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a fragile TV star and his stunt double, Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt), who is practically 'babysitting' him. Now, it struck me as being implausible that a TV star and their stunt double would socialise so much, let alone at all. However, this implausibility is addressed by the film and you just go with it and not overthink things. At times it seems that DiCaprio's acting is wooden, but that would just be more or less due to the character that he plays. His fragile ego is his shield, his sword. Or so I've heard. In some scenes Cliff Booth looks like the Marlboro Man, in others like Robert Redford. If you don't know about the historical references from the intersecting storyline, you would just take this film to be about the career ups and downs of Dalton and how that effects him. Speaking of historical references, there would be great nostalgia value for people who grew up watching film or TV especially, in the 1950s and 1960s, as you get many visual and audio grabs of popular US entertainment from that period as well as the popular music of this era.At this point I haven't looked to see if Dalton is a real person (perhaps with a changed name) or a truthy version/amalgam of some real actor or actors. His roles in TV and film suggest to me that he might be based in part on some real Hollywood figure...someone who starred in Westerns...and then played such roles overseas, for a while. So, I was wondering if that real person might have actually lived where 'Dalton' lived...or somewhere nearby.That question becomes more pronounced when Booth meets some people who I wondered if they were part of that intersecting story arc. In other words, I wondered if there really was a Cliff Booth type character involved in the historical event in question and whether he may have, in some sense, prompted that moment in history.One character (an actress), mentions the kinds of films which she has been in, which seemed a salacious detail to have in the film. The Wikipedia article on her is too lengthy for me to quickly confirm that detail but so far I don't see anything to confirm it. If the detail is false, it does make you wonder about how writer, director and producer Quentin Tarantino is mixing fact and fiction in this film. Anyway, looking a bit further in the article, I can see, perhaps, a candidate for what film she was talking about. I'd just need to check her film chronology (assuming this film is accurate or that a filmography would include such a film) in order to confirm that.For some people, I suppose, the heart of the matter is whether Tarantino is respecting the history of these real people and events. Maybe I shouldn't presume that Tarantino has done much research into the historical events that he portrays? For example, in one moment in the film, right towards the end, there is a scene which made me wonder whether Charlie was, in fact, responsible for the historical events. No, don't lookup \"Charlie\" if my reference has baffled you! In any case, that was an inference I made based on what a male character says to some women in a car with him. Does the real historical event allow for such an interpretation, as gleaned from this film by me?In a more trivial vein, there were a couple of times where I wondered if Cliff Booth was imagining something. In the first instance, there is his encounter with a man who would become a major Asian star. It's not clear to me whether the event depicted actually happened (i.e. in the film) or whether he was imagining it. There is another scene, towards, the end, where I wondered the same thing and this relates to my previous point about whether Tarantino is respecting the history. That latter scene brought into stark relief how these two intersecting story arcs would play out. Which narrative would envelope the other and which would be enveloped? Even though I can say that I was maybe expecting the unexpected in this film's ending, well, I wasn't really expecting that ending! Maybe I just haven't seen enough Tarantino films or something! In some ways, this film reminds me of another Tarantino film...they have some things in common. In any case, I was okay with the ending. I'm not sure how anyone personally affected by the historical events of that time would feel about the ending though but it was a long time ago, in any case.Miscellaneous notes:* At least two Australians are in the cast, perhaps three, if you don't assume a good impression of our accent (wise! Based on a real person?)* A stunning depiction of Cliff Booth's personal circumstances.* I liked Rick Dalton's scene with a very young actress who took her craft more seriously than he did! She would also hate me referring to her as an \"actress\"! I didn't catch the name on her chair: based on a real person?Recommendations:* Tarantino is one of the interviewees in the documentary: \"Not quite Hollywood: The wild, untold story of Ozploitation!\"* Summerfield. An Australian film that I've reviewed here. It has a similar vibe.", "What a loud of .......": "Just shows you can get a load of great actors And actresses, throw them into a bucket of scenes, and it still comes out like it's some amateur school attempt at a movie.I am really baffled by the high reviews here. Me thinks there's an element of \"emperors new clothes\" going on here. The reviews are as laughable as the film \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201a", "So Good!": "Tarantino delivers again! This movie is full of love for the 60's in Los Angeles, and it has plenty of surprises to keep you interested. Although it's long, you feel like the running time has just whipped by.Pitt and DiCaprio make a great movie team together, and QT has also cast Emile Hirsch in this as well, and we finally get a scene with him and DiCaprio, two people I always thought should play brothers or relatives of some kind. There are so many famous faces in this, some I didn't even realize until it was over, such as Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme!This was a movie not just for film geeks, but everyone can enjoy it. The audience truly appreciated that ending and clapped and screamed and stamped their feet. Or maybe I just had a rowdy crowd, whatever.", "Great, if you love cinematography and the 60ies.": "This is a time piece and a love letter to Hollywood. And if you gonna see this movie, please keep this in mind. It's film-making in the mind of Sergio Leone: Long stretches of atmosphere-building. Tarantino really lets the camera rest on his motives.And it works great, as the set design is outstanding. If you like the 60ies, this movie will feel like a time travel. The first scene showing the boulevard through Hollywood was breathtaking. The love for detail shines through everything. It was the moment where i knew i will buy the Blueray the moment it comes out. The atmosphere and the lifestyle is captured brilliantly.With all this, the story sure takes a step back. I'm okay with that, as what we're presented with is amazing. But then again, if you expected Pulb Fiction 2, you'll be majorily disappointed. This is a movie-lover's movie.", "Wtf": "This movie gets 9 stars purely for the complete and utter WTF last 15mins. Brilliant.Once you \"get it\" it all makes sence.", "Love Letter to Hollywood": "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" is an incredible love letter to the Hollywood of the 1960s, the magic of movie making, bromances, the golden glow of youth, the less shiny struggle of aging, Brad Pitt's ageless beauty, almost pathological attention to detail, and the deliciousness of great, messy slasher films. Such a unique idea and so beautifully made. I loved it. I really hope Quentin is lying about retiring, but this would be a pretty great one to go out on.", "QT's best since Pulp Fiction": "Tarantino is getting older and his movies are becoming a bit more reserved. Following the much-maligned \"Hateful Eight,\" Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is a treat, especially for movie buffs familiar with the history of the summer of 1969 in Hollywood. Some have commented on the lack of pure \"QT\" dialogue that made his other movies so entertaining (along with the stories and action). Others have complained about the length of this movie. You need to enter this world, and not only the worlds of the two leads (played by DiCaprio and Pitt, and they are both relaxed - for the most part - and hilarious i spots). You are transported to Hollywood, August 1969. And Tarantino gets everything right, from the look of Hollywood at the time, the movie marquees, the music, the clothes, the attitudes.\nLike some of this other films, the movie takes many liberties with historic events. The last shot of the film allows audiences to fill in the blanks as to what happens next.\nFor those who love slow-burn movies, and Tarantino, this movie is a must-see. I've seen it twice and could see it again tomorrow.", "A great film": "I've lived in LA for more than 30 years but was not here during the period the film covers. I was familiar with the Manson murders so I knew who, when, what, where. For me it was a trip back memory lane, three gig economy actors at different stages of their careers and lives. And it was amazing to see how much LA has stayed the same. I appreciated the interconnected characters and the slow and steady build to an ending that was amazing.", "Don't listen to the salty Tarantino fanboys": "All these people whining about this movie are either Tarantino fanboys who are salty this wasn't another shoot em up, or they are people who don't know about Sharon Tate or the Manson familyI think most of Tarantino movies are overrated, but this movie was a really nice change of pace.Anyone who actually wants to see a period piece about 1969 Hollywood will love this movie.People complaining about the lack of plot don't understand what type of movie this is.", "Loved it, superb performances": "I haven't anything new to add to the 1000s of reviews already here as we only got this today in the UK - it was a blast. I go to the cinema to be entertained and this is the most entertained I've been for a long time and the most entertaining Tarantino has been for a while too. The performances of Pitt and di Caprio are off the scale good and there are so many throw back references I know I'll enjoy a second viewing.", "Once Upon a Time... in Tarantino's film": "Tarantino once again shows that he has his own way of making a movie. If he wants to linger in a moment, he will. He's in no rush to get anywhere. This is present for example in the form of the many clips of the shows and films Dalton has starred in. Some other director might have rushed through the period showcasing to get to the juicy bit of the Manson family. But the focus isn't on them here. Once Upon A Time is most of all a homage to the Hollywood's golden era and to its end.There is a very real sense of dread at the end when the Family is on the prowl, but also a sense of longing of knowing that an era is about to come to an end. That era is here symbolized by Margot Robbie's portrayal of Sharon Tate, who was murdered before her career really got off. But then something happens at the end, something completely surprising. The ending is one of my favorites I've seen in a long time. It ties the whole movie together and it left a smile on my face. It's Tarantino once again throwing the rule book out of the window.Leonardo DiCaprio's star fading Rick Dalton and his stuntman played by Brad Pitt are at the center of the film. The focus isn't on the Manson Family. And rightfully so. This is a tribute to a bygone era, and the death of Sharon Tate's sort of symbolizes its end, so screw them. Dalton's fading career is played against Sharon Tate's bright looking career in Hollywood. There's a sort of expecting atmosphere throughout the film, because you think you what is going to happen. That's the ending works so well. It's a relief.The film is filled with talented actors, but the two headliners; DiCaprio and Pitt are the ones who stand out the most. The chemistry between the two of them is real. DiCaprio plays his character like he did in Django Unchained. He's able to go from one extreme motion to another. Pitt's stuntman is more abstained, although he too has a violent side in him. But what works here is the relationship between those to. You get the feel that these two really have a long history together.There's a lot less violence this time around than what one is usually expecting from Tarantino. A couple of scenes are still here to tick off that box, and especially the latter one of them is hilarious. Music also plays an important role here with a soundtrack that's filled with tunes that fit the times and mood of the film.Tarantino has made a film that has heart, by mixing in fantasy with the events from the history. It feels personal, rather than just being an overview into the events of the late sixties Hollywood, the death of Sharon Tate and the Manson Family, which would have been a pretty uninspired approach from a director of Tarantino's caliber. This film's aspiration is much higher than that. It has the same elements that we have come to expect from Tarantino's film, but it managed to evoke feelings in me that his previous films haven't.", "Disappointing": "I initially thought this film was going to be a slow build up to something amazing but as time goes on your just left waiting trying to piece things together as to what the story line is. For so many talented actors/actresses I felt this film was disappointing and id never recommend anyone to watch it.", "I loved this but it's not for everyone": "This isn't the usual Tarantino type action movie but I think that's what I loved about it. All of the acting was spot-on fantastic from the leads to the smallest parts. Brad and Leonardo were perfect. Al Pacino, Margot Robbie, Kurt Russell...everyone played their parts to perfection; and what I loved about it the most was the nostalgia. I was a teenager in 1969 living 30 miles from Hollywood and I remember the way things were; the movies and TV shows, the Hollywood landmarks, Spahn Ranch and the Manson murders and the music, so this was like re-living part of my past. I loved seeing Bruce Lee, Mama Cass, the Playboy Mansion; I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, and the last 30 minutes or so is Tarantino at his best. I'm guessing that all of the negative reviews are written by the younger generations; I think anyone who lived during this time period will enjoy the references to places and people. Maybe it is self-indulgence by Tarantino but I thank him for it. I loved it.", "Amazing Retro Movie": "Rating 9.5/10\nThis movie takes back you to late 60s retro. Wonderful cinematograpy and storyline to give new experience from different era's to audience. Superb acting performance to all the characters expecially Leonardo diCaprio a.k.a Rick Dalton and Brad Pitt a.k.a Cliff Booth. I was really amazed by the acting of Leo, he deserves the oscar for this role. Worth to watch.", "Loved it 10/10": "Great actors coming together to make a great film had ya in from the start with Tarintino style Gore near the end what more do ya need ain't no inglorious Basterds put def in his top 5 ...", "give it a couple watches.": "Ok so first time I watched I thought it was way too long and so underwhelming. That was until the last 30 minutes of the movie. It's like what in the hell just happened...I was speechless. I was giddy. I was blown away. You could even say I was somewhat aroused. I didn't know how to feel after the movie. I was ready to turn to one of my buddies and say \"that sucked\". I knew I needed a re watch immediately. This time knowing more of the backstory, I went in excited. Main goal was to appreciate the first 2 hours more. 20 minutes in to the re watch I fell in love. Leo and Brad had great chemistry that doesn't go unnoticed and they're both hot. This is my longest review by far but this is how great this movie really is. 2 watches folks. Once you do that, you're going to want to keep watching.", "Quentin Tarantino has lost it. Former glory turned mediocre. BORING, merely hanging on. No real spark or punch. Lacking greatness and a lot else...": "I ADORED the older Tarantino movies. I am not a hater. But this movie is seriously going nowhere plotwise. The many reviewers ALL complain about the same thing for a reason: there is NO plot and there is NO suspense whatsoever. I also believe this is the most boring picture Tarantino has ever made.An hour into the movie the story is still not catching fire, nor is it original or quirky or any kind of special. Even the violence is boring. Seriously. Tarantino at least always was shocking with his few, but intense violent scenes. Not this time around. Boring again. I am not kiddin. Really boring. Mmmm... I expected much more from Quentin Tarantino, but I fear he has lost his magic touch and is now depending on his former glory, which unfortunately has turned mediocre.The story meanders on and on about a sixties western actor that has become a has been. Could have been great with magnificent acting performances, but one can definitely say that these magnificent acting performances are painstakingly ABSENT. Too bad...I think it's not that sad that this is Tarantino's second to last picture of his career, because according to his own words he will only make one more picture and then he will retire for good. He promised himself to retire, because he does not wanna become a director, who has become a HAS BEEN. I fear Tarantino already is a HAS BEEN... Time to retire for good...Any good? Well, the photography is gorgeous. The soundtrack (as always) is terrific. Brad Pitt is good. Di Caprio is over doing it. Al Pacino looks laughable. Other supporting actors are totally superflous. Oh sorry, I forgot, I wanted to tell you about the good ... mmm let's think, no that's about it...", "This is why I love movies!": "I don't write reviews often, but this time I felt I had to. The reason being that many of the earlier reviews of this film meant that this movie is too long and not worth seeing. I respectfully disagree.The film is long, I give you that, but the deliberate pace puts you in the right mood and it tells an intriguing story with sexy chicks, real men and a setting that seems real - and I really loved it. Cinema magic!", "Tarantino's Soul Striptease": "If you would have watched this movie without knowing anything about it beforehand, as I did, you would have had a chance to enjoy it as much as I did.So next time a Tarantino movie comes around, turn off the internet, don't listen to the buzz, just keep your mind pristine. At least that's what I will do.", "Superb: another great piece of movie-making from Quentin Tarantino": "1969. Rick Dalton was once the star of a highly popular TV series but a few bad choices have set his career back, leaving him wondering if he should quit showbiz altogether. His best friend is Cliff Booth, an aging stuntman who was Dalton's stunt-double in movies and TV. His career is largely over. While Booth ekes out an existence, Dalton still lives a life of relative luxury in Hollywood, rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous. In fact, his neighbours are Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate...Superb movie, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Not like other Tarantino movies though: his trademarks - frequent, graphic violence and stylised dialogue - are toned down. Instead we have a wonderful character study as we follow the lives of Dalton and Booth, and, to a lesser extent, Sharon Tate.Many Tarantino traits do remain though. The plot is as immersive as ever: the 161 minutes just fly by. The sub-plots are brilliant, especially the movie-within-a-movie segments (would love it if those Rick Dalton movies and TV shows were real...). The movie segments highlight Tarantino's reverence for and extensive knowledge of cinema and its history.The soundtrack is amazing, as you would also expect from Tarantino. Fits perfectly into the movie and helps the momentum of the movie too.Great performances from Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt in the lead roles. Margot Robbie, as Sharon Tate, doesn't have much dialogue but absolutely lights up the screen. Her innocence and exuberance define the era and set up a wonderful counterpoint to the evil lurking in the shadows.Only reason I didn't give this a 10/10 is that it felt incomplete. I kept thinking that something more was due to happen, but then it didn't. Turned out this was due to my lack of precise knowledge of the events surrounding Sharon Tate. Once I realised what Tarantino had done, I then felt this should be a 10/10. I decided to go with how I felt coming out of the cinema, rather than how I felt after reading a few other reviews and Wikipedia.Therein lies the movie's only problem. The viewer's opinion of this movie is possibly dependant on how much they know about the events surrounding Sharon Tate. I know the historic characters involved, so enjoyed the Hollywood references and in-jokes. I also know how things turned out, so kept expecting the movie to link up with that. My lack of knowledge of the precise details meant I missed Tarantino's clever twist.Someone who has no knowledge of Sharon Tate will not have this weight of expectation and could just watch this as a (totally fictional) drama. Even then it's a great movie, but far less layered for that viewer.", "Horribly disappointing & waste of time": "One of those movies you regret TRYING to watch. I kept waiting for it to get better. There was a tease of a Charlie Manson plot ( murder in Hollywood) but it never happened (wasn't even close to the real murder story) . Chalked full of well know celebrities I kept thinking it would get better. I did not get better. Not even close. It barely HAD a plot. It was like who ever wrote the script couldn't keep a train of thought. It had no climax. It didn't really finish or close. Even the best action scene in the movie came too late to call it a climax. I kept thinking this was just a movie to keep actors in Hollywood Working through this economic crisis. You know? Like when they throw some really old actor a bone by giving him a part in a movie, so he can pay his taxes? Like that. This movie was so bad I don't think I could even watch it if I was blasted. It was a total disappointment.", "Kill Time Vol. 9": "The great Elvira once rhetorically asked and politely answered herself out loud: \"Hey, does anyone know what that movie was about? Uh, I'll tell you what it was about. It was about an hour and a half too long.\"Coincidentally, about one and a half hours into this almost three hour film I asked myself what this movie was about and thought: this is gonna be a tough synopsis in my review. But, I had faith in Quentin Tarantino and knew, somehow, he was gonna link the sixty subplots together and/or circle around and make this all make sense.At about 2 hours, 20 minutes - I couldn't take it anymore. I sat in silence this whole movie up to that point and finally asked my friend: WHAT IS THIS MOVIE ABOUT? (He laughed; he didn't know.) Fast forward to the end credits and I said more out-loud to the screen: \"I'd really like to know what that movie was about?!\"The guy next to me, who seemed to enjoy it way more than myself said: \"Well, it's a story.\" I politely agreed with him and asked what story was it. Him: \"Oh, it was a fantasy.\" Yeah, thanks, I got *that.*Don't get me wrong. This movie was extremely well shot and the acting between Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt was AMAZING. In fact, if both got nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, I'd be totally on board. And, I did really like the music and a ton of the scenes made me laugh or excited - namely with tough guy Pitt's character.But, the story, or lack thereof, was so incredibly frustrating for me. I got it. I don't need to see it again - as a matter of fact, I never want to see this again. I can follow the movie just fine. Without spoiling specifics, there were a good dozen or more actions suggested and then concluded. Over and over, someone suggested something to another and they completed said task and the characters moved on. Repeatedly.And the main twist? Well, as people love to do - I won't here, you're welcome - someone spoiled the climax for me. They didn't come right out and tell me the ending, but basically winked that I would enjoy this \"take.\" Even without that person spoiling the movie, it's not hard to see where this was going, especially if you've seen other Tarantino movies.So, if that's the case, if the movie's based on the twist, it makes for a very weak third act that was supposed to make up for all the mundane scenes we sat through for nearly two and a half hours.Fine, there is a \"plot.\" Basically, a soon-to-be out TV/Movie actor in 1969 is trying to reinvent himself and his insecurities with his best bud/stunt double in tow. He goes up and down and sideways to stay above water. And then real life comes a-knocking.It's sad I'm so frustrated with all this because I absolutely loved both the chemistry between the two leads and their individual characters. And I wanted them to live and succeed. But, when all is said and done, it's just a string of causes and effects with absolute conclusions for each, so basically, you're just watching people live out their everyday lives.I certainly did NOT hate this movie, but as you'll see below, this is absolutely my least favorite Tarantino film and hope to never take this trip down Hollywood Blvd. again.***Final thoughts:\nAll Nine Ranked Quentin Tarantino Directed films, if the Kill Bill Volumes are counted separately:\n1.

I can handle tangents and digressions, but this movie was nothing but that.It was clearly made so QT could show his knowledge and love for those tv shows and movies and that era. Beyond that it a pointless and boring movie.I wanted to like it. I am usually the first to defend QT, but not this time. What a waste of such an incredible cast.

He did an amazing job conveying that love in his 9th film \"Once Upon Time...in Hollywood.\" Amazing cast, the absolute BEST performances by DiCaprio & Pitt, and the idea that Hollywood could be vastly different had things gone differently on Cielo drive in August of 1969.

The \"West\" was good. The \"America\" I found too long and boring. Every scene dragged out way to the point of annoyance.Same with this \"Hollywood\" version now directed by Quentin Tarantino;\nIt seems the entire movie is a documentary of details and recreation of how it looked back in those days. That is fine, but don't forget you are filming a movie. Not adapting a book that has to describe how everything looks, how a person walks, and how the methodically smoke their cigarette.\nThat is boring to watch and is not driving the story.So after 1 1/2 hour and the movie still doesn't make me care for the characters or what the point of the movie is, making me sit in my chair yawning and still wondering what the plot is, me and my date also agree to go as I saw she was bored as hell.\nSeveral other people in the cinema had left before us too.So I am wondering what all the praise for this bore fest is?\nI might watch it again later on other means just to see the ending.\nA day I am bored and have nothing else to do.", "Tarantino at his finest": "Having always been such a fan of his other films, I saw this as one his greatest movies of all time.

When I saw the trailer i was confused but waited until it came to dvd and thank god I did. Nothing happens in this movie. Where is the story?? Why was this movie even made?? I fell asleep twice and when I woke up still nothing was happening. QT really dropped the ball on this one.", "Not what I was Expecting": "Quentin Tarantino's 9th film features some of the biggest superstars in the business. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt really are the best duo since Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is worth watching just for the epic star power alone along with Tarantino's signature killer soundtrack. Tarantino is known to subvert norms and create controversy. He does so here, but to a lesser satisfying degree.When news first hit about Tarantino doing an old Hollywood piece centering around the Manson murders of 1969, one could assume he'd be doing another wild over-the-top bloodbath with snappy dialogue, entertaining storytelling and iconic characters. While the Mansons and Sharon Tate are present in the film, their roles are disappointingly underrepresented. Sharon Tate (played gleefully by Margot Robbie) does not do much throughout the movie but watch her own films. The Manson ranch is shown but Charlie Manson is only present for five seconds. These people vital to the real life story don't really have much purpose here. The story focuses more on Leonardo DiCaprio's character Rick Dalton, a former TV star trying to stay relevant in the Hollywood spotlight.While the story at hand with Rick Dalton has its moments (Bruce Lee scene and forgetting lines), it's too long and too dragged out. Tarantino goes for setting an authentic feel, and establishing character development over plot. Much of the film feels like it's going nowhere, so it's boring sometimes. The film is more of a love letter to old Hollywood. A lot of work was put into taking us back in time to 1969, impressively done without CGI. It's impressive technically but it lacks an exciting narrative - something Tarantino normally delivers on. The first two hours or so shows everyday life for these characters, but doesn't become a 'movie' until the end. The last 15 minutes is classic Tarantino. Without spoiling it, it utilizes everything we have come to know and love about Tarantino. He subverts your expectations, but to a lesser satisfying degree.A film where Tarantino brought every act of his storytelling prowess together was The Hateful Eight. The Hateful Eight set up a mystery while making the audience guess what was going to happen next. Then it climaxed into a violent, hysterical, quotable, and utterly badass bloodbath. But what Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was lacking was the build-up to the climax. The ending was just slapped on so you know you're watching Tarantino. The Hateful Eight worked better as a story which is why the ending was much more satisfying than this film.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood delivers some rare cinematic treats, courtesy of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. However, one can't help but feel a little disappointed with Tarantino given the stellar cast and the legendary Manson backstory he had to work with.", "what's with all the feet": "Once upon time Hollywood is an extremely long movie is extremely dull and boring. It seems like 90% of the first half of the movie is driving the entire scenes, devoted to fictional TV shows and movies, and endless weird shots of women's feet. There's a lot of pointless details and this movie needs a serious amount of editing. Sometimes seems like people forgot what movie they were making and just start filming of Western TV show instead. A lot of the great acting talents are wasted in this movie. The acting is good but the plot line in writing is terrible. Quentin Tarantino also constantly references his other films and is pointless extended universe. The female characters including Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate's are objectified, not given much dialogue, and have their feet prominently shown. In fact Sharon Tate's character barely speaks at all and the only time you see her a male voiceover is telling you what she thinks. This is extremely troubling from a depiction of a female character especially given that Sharon Tate was a real-life figure that was murdered. The murder of the Manson family is also extremely graphic intense and prolonged. This scene also turns violence against women into a joke. The death of the female characters is so prolonged and gruesome it makes you feel bad for serial killers. The movie seems to take joy out of brutally murdering women not to mention that the main character murdered his wife. Quentin Tarantino replaced the gruesome murder of Sharon Tate with the gruesome murder of the Manson family. Quentin Tarantino seems to believe that gruesome murder in his movies is justified that they are preventing another murder. This movie is a piece of trash that turns a Manson family into a boring prolonged joke. Dakota Fanning's acting talents are wasted in this movie at her character squeaky does not play a major role. I believe that this movie has more editing objectify the female characters less and was less gruesome it would overall be better. In the end I would not recommend this to our piece of garbage unless your creepy foot fetish person like Quentin Tarantino. I think it's the worst movie ever to be nominated for an Oscar. In the end I would not recommend seeing it at all costs regardless about what people tell you.", "Garbage": "Garbage, one of the worst movies that exists, almost three hours of pure garbage, there is no history.", "Laughing so hard": "This movie is amazing. I was actually kinda frustrated about something, but that was my own fault. I was led to believe one of the characters would have a greater impact on the story - but those were my own crazy theories and the movie was not about that. But it is an amazing movie. It plays a lot with the audience's expectations, so I guess the way not to like this movie is trying to force your own expectations, instead of just enjoying the ride. Amazing actors. Amazing scenes. The ending is really, really good. When I understood what the movie was actually about, I was laughing so hard, it felt great. Another great movie from Tarantino. I don't even watch Hollywood movies anymore. Japanese anime and Korean cinema are way better. I didn't have much expectations about this movie being a great movie. But it was.", "I thought I knew what an amazing film was until I saw this!": "Once upon a time in Hollywood is an incredible film. I loved every moment of it. So much so I've seen it now twice in so many days. And plan on going again later this week, and I'm sure that won't be the last time I see it while it's still playing at the cinema.Personally I'm not a fan of Tarantino films, I find them slow and over the top with a few exceptions. However hands down once upon a time in Hollywood is my favourite. Actually come to think about it the best film I have ever seen.\nThe acting is brilliant but isn't that to be expected from the likes of Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt and Leo?\nI don't really want to give too much of this film away. Just go see it!!", "Fun, sentimental comedy-western-drama-suspense hyper-movie.": "Hard to classify, but that is okay 'cause it is very good. Was afraid it would be gruesome and unpleasant but Tarantino was way ahead of me. Not giving away anything and feel lucky that I had little idea what to expect. About half way through the suspense began to build. Where on Earth is this going? It will help if you have knowledge of the details of what was known as the Tate-LaBianca murders. A lovely trip for those who remember Hollywood in about 1969. Remember Larry Vincent (Seymour) and 93KHJ-Los Angeles? The depiction of the Manson \"family\" looks spot on to me. Sort of like looking over Liberty Valance's gang and deciding you would not want to ride with them. The story also brings to mind The Party (1968) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) as well as a whole lot of television. This movie goes by fast, like life. When a story is this good I sometimes tack on a moral in my mind, so: \"Second chances in real life are few, so give it all you've got with love.\"", "Classic wester/60s vibe + Tarantino = amazing": "A movie build on the concept of an actor who's career is slowly dying in the business... A simple plot following the actor and his stuntdoubble. For someone who loves western and 50s/60s movies this movie is a blast! And if you are willing to wait for it, the classic Tarantino violence, which we all love, will come, just be patient! Not in the \"Django Unchained\" end scenes style, but in a much more compressed style, which I personally loved (not just because Tarantino is in my top 5 favorite directors)", "Entertaining throughout": "Highlights:\nTarantino's impeccable attention to detail for the period is everywhere.Beautifully shot as always, with a highlight being the tracking shots alongside car and horse rides.Character development took a precedence over excess action and violence as the story built up.Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are fantastic.10-year-old Julia Butters as the precocious child actor is pretty great too.Margaret Qualley leads a good cast for the Manson family; the scene on the ranch is suitably creepy.Evokes the glamor of Hollywood but also the pathos of those on the edge, e.g. aging and B-actors.Entertaining throughout a long run time, 161 minutes.Lowlights:\nOddly constructed story, with the Manson murder aspect somewhat appended on.Along these lines, not nearly enough Margot Robbie / Sharon Tate.What was up with the diss of Bruce Lee? Not a fan of that scene.Revenge fantasy via alternate versions of history seems a little overdone by QT at this point.Gruesome violence in the end scene. It felt a little like Tarantino feeding red meat to his base, and it was kinda tough to hear these scenes cheered when we're living in such a climate of violence. It's as if Tarantino is showing us what he would like to do to those who would link on-screen violence to real-life violence, which has been a touchy issue for him over his career. One of the brainwashed Manson women (Mikey Madison) says \"My idea is to kill the people who taught us to kill!\" and then, well, we see what happens to her.", "Tarantino's Best Since Vol. 2": "The negative reviews are from people used to watching the film equivalent of popcorn (what I mean to say is that they have no attention span and expect the media they consume to be spelled out for them in large bold text). As far as cinema goes, Tarantino's last three before this one were underwhelming. Not that there weren't great moments in 8, Django, or Bast-rds, but none where a satisfying, whole experience. These films lacked humility and I would call them, for lack of a better phase, ego projects beyond Tarantino's usual sensibilities. Once Upon a Time however, while not downplaying Tarantino's ego, finds the perfect balance between character study, character drama, mystery, and suspense. If I were being objective I would rate the film 8/10, but seeing that the score is 7.7 at the time of this review I feel an obligation to rate it a 10 (especially when Joker has an 8.5; IMDB score has never been a fair representation of the quality of a film or TV show, but the site has gotten horrendous in the past 5 years).", "A very unusual movie, even for Tarantino.": "I believe that a lot of people didn't understand this movie like there's no sense or something. I can't say it has a really deep meaning but a nice idea with perfect realization. The story about 3 actors on Hollywood in different perspective. The actor that reaches the highest peak of actor carrier, stuntman and actress having satisfaction from positive reaction on her movie role. And it's really interesting to watch each of them because with the great performance, characters feel so natural. I feel that it's like a genre that Tarantino try to make and maybe it will affect in his future films. So, Quentin Tarantino once again made an awesome and entertaining movie.", "Don't Be Fooled By Bad Reviews!!!": "A lot of reviews on this site will tell you that this movie doesn't have a defining plot. However, a lot of Tarantino's movies don't have defining plots. Most of them are about people doing things in interesting scenes that leave you entertained. This film is about an actor and a stuntman who are trying to make it in Hollywood. That's pretty much the gist of it with random things in between. Even so, this film is amazing. Excellent film making at its finest. Plus, the ending is more than worth it. I also enjoy how it shows the struggling working men who are trying to make a living as the protagonists and lazy, freeloading, hippies as the antagonists. Even though this takes place in the 60s I feel as though the narrative is not so different from today's truth. Keep up the good work, Mr, Tarantino. We need more films like this, nowadays.", "A triumph": "One of Tarantino's best works, some of the greatest acting ever. Magnificent cinematography and editing. A sure fire Best Picture nominee or winner. The comedic side of it is hilarious and fun.\nI've seen other reviews on here, saying it's boring with no plot. So wrong. The plot is Leo and Pitt's characters looking for work in the summer of the Manson murders in LA. And for those saying it's boring, too bad.

This film is an absolute triumph for Tarantino", "Very good the movie": "This movie is obviously coming from heaven, it's one of my best movies", "Tarantino is the master": "When Brad Pitt enters the hippie farm, I was on the edge of my seat, trying to figure out what was going to happen. With Quentin Tarantino, you never know! If there is an opportunity for some epic acting and scenes, Tarantino will not abstain, continuity be damned!In this movie, Tarantino manages to seemingly effortlessly bring back the 70's in all it's neon glory. How does he do it? I think it's something with little quirks from that time that no one remembers and something with the physics of the cars. Either way, my jaw dropped several times in amazement of this universe that he is able to create with just a few shots.I don't think any other director would dare use a voice over to fast forward in the story and set the scenes. There are plenty of signature techniques here by Tarantino that are at odds with what you learn in cinematic classes. But he just does it anyway for the greater good, I guess.Overall the story is kind of a mess if you think about it. Still, it's the most memorable movie I've watched in 2019, and the only one I'd like to watch again. Look, I'm gonna be honest here. I'm just here to praise Tarantino, OK? I'm giving this a 10 although it's actually an 8 or 9 in my book. But I wish other AAA movie directors would learn from this man and his brazen ways.

When I saw this movie I thought 'This could train me to be royalty' So I watched the movie because my imaginary friends aunt lives there. THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD. But where were the Disney characters?? I wondered this throughout the whole movie", "Tarantino being influenced by Tarantino": "If Quentin Tarantino would watch his own movies and would be inspired by them, Once upon a time in Hollywood is the result. If you're looking for a fast-paced, action packed film with a thin plotline, you should watch the Fast & Furious or something. If you want to be awed by great actors at their best, great cinematography, a perfect soundtrack, a fantastic story arch, beautiful scenery and a rewarding finale, you should watch this movie!After all those superhero flicks (which I absolutely adore) and reboots of old movies, this one is quite refreshing. We all know the story of the Manson family, which is there somewhere in the background. But the main story is that of DiCaprio's Rick Dalton and Pitt's Cliff Booth. Dalton is struggling as an actor, Booth seems completely unconscerned as a stunt double. The chemistry between the two of them is off the hook. You're mainly watching them trying to keep working, which gives you the opportunity to see short films within the movie.It is what Tarantino does best; put a bunch of brilliant actors together, add great writing, which gives you cool conversations, even when nothing is really happening (which is like 80% of the time). The cinematography makes it the more interesting and I'd even go as far as to say that this is the best I've ever seen of DiCaprio.I rated it 10/10. Am I being generous? Maybe, but I loved every second of it. This one belongs with Tarantino greats like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Inglorious Basterds.", "Ignore the bad reviews": "Whilst this movie isn't the typical Tarantino-styled movie that you would expect, it is nothing less than a masterpiece. Anyone complaining about the movie being 'too slow' or 'boring' is either a hater of Tarantino, or simply has the IQ of a 12-year-old.A real movie enthusiast would appreciate how such a simple story with the perfect setting can be turned into a a fiesta of entertaining events. Thanks to the fantastic script and the phenomenal acting (coming from loveable characters), I personally enjoyed the movie and savored every second of it.", "Mixed Feelings": "Some things about this movie I loved a lot. Other things I didn't really know how to process. There was about 45 minutes that could have been cut out. All of QT's movies are self-indulging, but this was a little different. It was unique, but not very clever. Some things happened a little too easily. Surprise ending? I saw it coming. Even when I don't completely connect with a QT movie, I usually respect that he hits the mark he was going for. But this one might have been a little left of the bull's eye. As I mentioned, there's a lot to appreciate and it was a fun ride. With another viewing, I might kick it up to 8 stars, or possibly down to 6. I'm not completely sure how I feel about this one.", "One of the best of 2019... near perfect": "Here's my review for the 9th film by Quentin Tarantino, \"Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood\". Spoilers ahead:This movie was everything I wanted, and more. I expected it to be your typical Tarantino, and at times it was, but it just felt so different. Leonardo DiCaprio (Rick Dalton) and Brad Pitt (Cliff Booth) are both insanely good in this movie, they have great chemistry, and are incredibly hilarious. I liked the cameo from Bruce Lee a lot, I thought it was very funny, although I do feel it disrespected the legend a little bit. Margot Robbie is pretty good as Sharon Tate, but I feel she was a bit underutilized. The second act does feel a bit slow, and there is one scene in that act, and for me it was the only part that really dragged (just a bit though). But I loved the aspects that had to do with the Manson Family, especially the final scene which was amazing. It seamlessly combined action and comedy, and I loved every second of it. This movie was amazingly written, Tarantino did a fantastic job. The shots in this movie (also done by Tarantino) were fantastic, they were beautifully helmed. The movie, much like many other Tarantino films, feels very self-indulgent, as he doesn't make a movie for the people, he makes them for himself, and that's why he is one of my favorite directors working today. This movie doesn't have a true narrative, and that brings up a topic that I've been wanting to talk about for some time now.People nowadays are so accustomed to movies having big blockbuster stories, and they think something big has to be happening every second of every minute, and that is why I love Tarantino. His movies always come out in the midst of big blockbusters, and huge Oscar contenders, and he kind of gets overshadowed a lot. He creates movies that are far more complex, and I very much welcomed this film.In conclusion, this movie was amazing, and it'll be a movie that I watch for years to come.Conclusion:\nWould I Recommend?: This movie is violent, and won't be for everybody, but for people who want an action movie that they can also laugh with, this is a must watch.Quality Rating: 94%\nEnjoyment Rating: 98%Final Rating: A (96%)", "Honestly": "I highly anticipated this movie for almost a year. The positive factors about this movie are the authenticity from the actors, the played superbly. Another is that Tarentino did really well in making it as 60's as possible. The negatives are the ending, i waited a year, i sat through 2 and half hours of small talk. The last 15 minutes were honestly awful and i don't think this movie was good at all. His best movie to date, is probably django unchained and pulp fiction. Other than that, this one goes straight in the gutter.", "Gets Everything Right Except An Overall Point": "In watching the trailers for Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood, they promise an incredible period piece set in 1960s Hollywood. If that is your primary reason for watching, this film may just speak to your very soul. If you want a deeper story with more of a point to it, however, you might leave this experience feeling somewhat disappointed.Ostensibly, this movie tells two concurrent stories that eventually overlap with each other: Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an aging former Western star who is struggling to get acting work and stay relevant. The same goes for his stunt man Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who chauffeurs him around and is somewhat of a confidant. At the same time, young actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is experiencing a rapid climb to LA success. As I said, eventually these plotlines converge when the Manson Clan begins to factor more heavily into the story.In terms of aesthetic, Once Upon A Time... absolutely hits it out of the park. The music of the time provides an incredible soundtrack, the cinematography is impressive (as per the usual Tarantino style), and the entire experience convincingly plops the viewer into \"Old Hollywood\". The actors all nail their parts (with a star-studded cast like this, how could they not?!) and during the entire 160 minute runtime there is a good mix of drama, comedy, and action/adventure. A special shout-out needs to go to Margaret Qualley, whose hippy/cult character utterly commands every scene she is in.The main problem I had with the movie, though, was that it didn't seem to have much of a point or purpose from beginning to end. There is so much going on from scene to scene that viewers will likely not be bored, per se, but there seems to be an ephemeral approach to the overall goals of the picture. It just sort of drifts from plot to plot, with the aesthetics filling in the gaps instead of well-crafted, plot-driven writing.In fact, I would argue it commits a rather cardinal sin of assuming the audience knows the story behind some of its true-to-life figures (such as Ms. Tate). Because director Tarantino often plays with or subverts the expectations of the history books, there is a heavy degree of assumption that audiences will know \"the facts\" of what actually happened to these historical figures. I did not know this information, and thus was rather confused by some of the in-film events taking place (especially the ending). Now that I've done a little post-credits research I understand better what Tarantino was trying to accomplish, but during the watching experience I often found myself lost.Overall, I can say I was entertained by Once Upon A Time... but little more. It was fun to see such star acting power all grouped together, and Tarantino is good enough at his craft to make sure it doesn't completely fall apart, but there was a lot here that I just couldn't relate to because it assumed a modicum of knowledge that I did not possess. Maybe I'm the outlier here and others will follow along better than me, but for the under-40 set I feel like it might be a challenge without a history brush-up.", "A slow-burning love letter to '60s Hollywood": "Tarantino's ninth film reveals his huge love for the Hollywood of 60s, and is heavily loaded with pop culture references of that era, has clever callback moments to his own movies, and several Easter eggs including signature Tarantino shots and brief cameos by legends. One may or may not get these references all the time, but realizing them does make the viewing experience richer, as Tarantino decides to randomly be nice or mean to several reel and real life souls, while neatly altering the history - he himself has never cared about it, so shouldn't you. The Fuhrer of Nazis was killed in a French theater owned by a Jew, remember? So, if something unexpected happens with Bruce Lee or Sharon Tate in this Hollywood world, don't worry about it.The authenticity has been taken care of - the streets, the magazines, the pop style and the background score - these all make the movie constantly emanate the vibe of a grand movie set in L.A. The narration though slow paced, is compelling for the most part. It demands a lot of time to engage one, getting even stagnant at times. What work during these sequences are the amusing dialogues, Robert Richardson's lively cinematography and the apt acting by the entire cast - something not to worry about in a Tarantino movie. This cinematic slow-burner demands your attention. Expect less action and violence, except for the obvious climax.", "A Tarantino film I didn't hate!": "I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino (sorry but I don't think that copying the styles and/or set decoration of '60s and '70s films or cramming a script full of nods to them makes someone a \"genius\") but I gotta hand it to him on this one... A 2 hour and 41 minute film where the first 2 hours and 30-something minutes are basically the set-up for a joke! Must be nice to have the clout to be able to pull that off!I imagine that Tarantino came up with the kooky \"what if\" ending first and then went back to the beginning and wrote the script, figuring out how to get the two main characters there. I'm not sure that it needed to take them six months.Fortunately, the background story of Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Pitt) is fairly interesting. Both actors inhabit the roles flawlessly. DiCaprio is particularly good. He emotes with the best of 'em. There's also nice cinematography, great period detail, and lots of classic music here. Yes, it's self-indulgent with the gazillion things that are alluding to other things and the way it's sometimes practically screaming, \"LOOK, it's 1969!!\" Almost every shot with a visible television screen is playing the open of a popular '60s show. \"Look, it's 'Mannix' so it's 1969!\" A flashback with Booth and his wife seems to be inspired by Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood but it would be more obvious (and make more sense) if the actress playing his wife resembled Wood.Teens and millennials probably won't get a lot of the references/homages or know who some of the real people depicted in the film are. Certain references might not resonate with seniors either. My niece and nephew would have no idea who Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski were. My mother remembered the Tate-LaBianca murders but didn't recognize Bruce Lee or realize that he was dressed as Kato from \"The Green Hornet.\" I, myself, did not pick up on the references to other Tarantino movies because I've only seen a few others and didn't care for them. A viewer would have to know of the Manson \"Family\" murders in order to really appreciate (or maybe just \"get\") the ending of the film.The violence near the end is over-the-top but I guess that's a Tarantino thing.What-ifs are, well, iffy. Speculating about what people, who are no longer around to defend themselves, might do is touchy. Thankfully, Tarantino doesn't disrespect Sharon Tate and her friends or make them look bad.A note to all of the people describing this movie as depicting \"the golden age of Hollywood...\" 1969 was NOT, I repeat, not the golden age of Hollywood! Please watch some TCM, feel ashamed, and do some sort of penance immediately.I can't believe that I actually paid to see a Quentin Tarantino film in a theater and then didn't want my money or the 161 minutes of my life back!", "A fictional redemption for a lost generation of idealism and presumed innocence": "I took myself on a day date to see it because I like Tarantino.\nEveryone knows that I'm sick of the exploitation of Manson... but I see what Tarantino did here.\nExpect to be satisfied. Throughout the story we see what is happening to several iconic images of Americana. The humble hero and his sidekick. The beautiful starlet. The breakdown of a former society by a new generation of idealism and rebellion. Through the almost meta and flippant discussions of producers costuming the fictional actors and the use of actual radio commercials and television ads that copied (and exploited) the 60's counter culture of fashion and music, we see how the Hollywood ad culture and someone like Manson and everyday commercial brands discredited and corrupted a generation that was trying to fight all of that.\nMuch like \"Inglourious Basterds\" and its fictional ending for the Nazi party at the hands of the next Jewish generation, I'm glad that the historical villain in this story is not glamorized or even focused on, while at the same time the good guys win. When I saw \"Basterds\" in the theaters there was a woman crying and saying that she loved all of it because she had Jewish relatives who died in the Holocaust.\nThis was a fictional tale of redemption for a generation of idealism, resistance and innocence that was commodified, commercialized, and exploited to brink of a horrific end.", "Tarantino lovingly showcases his passion for cinema": "This is probably his film most similar to Pulp Fiction since the 1994 classic was released. The late 60s Hollywood setting is basically a character itself as QT fills much of the runtime with references to the time period. It is a long movie, however it's easy to get sucked into this wonderful, recreated world. Leo and Brad are a terrific pairing and the rest of the cast fill their roles nicely. I can see this film being a little divisive, though you should know what you're getting with Tarantino by this point. The story does seem to meander a bit, but it all comes together and subverts expectations. The ending is classic Tarantino and is a nice feather in the cap of his love letter to cinema.", "Very long and boring and pointless": "In these days of Tarrantino can't go wrong, all I can say is he only dhd two films... Pulp fiction and deathproof. This is total dross zzzzzzzz", "Golden age of Hollywood delivers with Tarantino's witty script and direction.": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (4 out of 5 stars).Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's love letter to the 1960s Hollywood era. Tarantino is a huge film geek from the 60s/70s era. His latest film is fun, entertaining, and very moving. What can you expect in Tarantino's film? A huge cast ensemble, an overlong running time, a slow moving story with a lot of dialogue in his script, a sharp 60s direction, and this time just a brutal fight climax that does not over do it like his other films.The plot is a dramatic/ comedic love letter to the 60s Hollywood era. It follows a struggling actor Rick (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is trying to make it big into movies and getting out from doing western tv shows. His stunt double Cliff (Brad Pitt) and him are best friends. They do a lot of work together. Cliff gets caught up and notices a bunch of hippie girls in a film ranch that he once knew. Which these group of girls are following a serial killer Charles Manson (Damon Herriman).It is a slow moving plot. If you are a fan of the 1960s Hollywood theme. This film will be quite enjoyable. Leonardo DiCaprio is great playing Rick Dalton. An actor that is trying hard with his roles in the movie. Brad Pitt was good. There is a huge cast ensemble like Margot Robbie playing Sharon Tate, which she is living with her husband Roman and her ex boyfriend Sebring (Emile Hirsch). Living right next to Rick.The film is entertaining with its 1960s setting, the golden age of Hollywood, and a cult following Charles Mansion. The style, clothing, and the vintage soundtrack are fun. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio on screen chemistry worked great. Seeing the two on screen was a lot of fun and captivating. Rick is usually seen acting in a western show and trying to deliver his best when he is not messing up his lines. Cliff picks up a hitchhiker girl and takes her to a film ranch which he finds it suspicious.The film does have a thrilling and suspenseful climax without getting too much into details. It might be a hit or a miss with the audience, especially the ending of the film. Cause you are curious on what Quentin Tarantino's targeting tone of the movie is trying to be. It is not as bloody compared to Hateful Eight or his other films. It does have a brutal fight scene. The film does end a little too abruptly with you asking that's it? Which it apparently is, and it was not the kind of story you were expecting.Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a good comedy drama film. It is one of Quentin Tarantino's better films. It is a slow moving story, a fun sharp direction by Tarantino and his witty script. The cast was great. It does get a little lost with the tone and ending.", "it is Margot Robbie that illuminates this saga": "Wonderful! The first Tarantino film, for a long time, that I have straight away wanted to see again. I'm sure I spent much of the film with a grin on my face. I certainly felt like applauding scene after scene. The evocation of the late 60s is astonishingly well achieved with sequence after sequence seemingly being advertisement pages of Playboy magazine come alive. The magical allure of neon signs flicking on, a crane shot to reveal the sleazy allure of the drive-in movie theatre and all those wondrous motor vehicles and perfectly period dressed individuals. And despite all this contrivance, still the director manages to convey much of the laid-back living and movie making style of the time. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are sensational, both pulling out all the stops in difficult parts to convince , amuse and inform. Margaret Qualley is stunning as Pussycat, the young lady we see most of from amongst Manson's girls. She manages to convey that innocent and childlike being combined with a startling knowingness that chills even before we have met the horrors and delights that are his farmland harem. More than anyone else, however, it is Margot Robbie that illuminates this saga. With the subject as it is and the knowledge of Sharon Tate being as we know she was, this central role, even if not the largest in the film, is the most important to have got right. Tate had a certain translucence, an illuminating presence in front of the camera (still or movie) and Robbie gets it spot on. Even when faced with moving pictures of the Polanski girl herself, Robbie's performance shines. There is so much more I loved, including the many references to Spaghetti westerns, the film posters spoof and real, the music and the dialogue but overall it is the affectionate and passionate representation of a very short period in cultural history that brings that smile and urge to applaud. Not, then a wham bam, non-stop extravaganza of crazy, snappy dialogue interspersed with constant violence but, instead a sustained and brilliant impression of a certain time, that happens to include one gut wrenching and prolonged scene of considerable and most effective violence.", "My new favorite Tarantino film.": "#16 Add to bobspez's Reputation Report Post\nOld Today, 05:26 PM\nbobspez\nSenior MemberStatus: \"...\" Edit (set 1 year ago)Join Date: Feb 2011\n3,157 posts, read 1,307,353 times\nReputation: 7630Saw it on cable last night. A great movie. Probably my new favorite Tarantino movie and I haven't like his more recent efforts. To me it was like an homage to Hollywood, to the movie business, to the 1970's. And maybe an homage to Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski who were living the Hollywood dream. Great acting, beautifully shot, great music, really captured the LA and Hollywood of the time. Loved the Hollywood happy ending too. If only ... who can say what would have been.", "Awesome Movie; Ignore the Bad Reviews": "One has to understand some of the history behind Charles Manson before watching this great movie and reviewing it. Phenomenal acting by DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie. There were some great cameos as well. I love when Tarantino rewrites history where the good guys prevail overall.Anyone who rated this movie less than 8 should not be allowed to rate and review movies at all. This is where IMDB fails society; when they let any moron review and rate a movie. Many times I have to rate a movie which is not truly a 10 a 10, just to counter the morons who vote them a 1.", "Excellent film , a sad what if film": "Classic QTWon't give it away but excellent filmWhat every man needs -a loyal dog and a flame thrower", "Stunning homage to 60s Tinseltown": "I was 14 in 1969. I can remember watching \"Lancer\" on tv and having a huge crush on James Stacy (played perfectly by Timothy Oliphant), so this magical homage to 1960s film and tv was not only very nostalgic but also entertaining, amusing and thought provoking. What would have happened if the Manson murderers had gone to another house on Cielo Drive to be slaughtered themselves by a stunt man (and dog )and a faded tv cowboy? That's the showdown this leisurely and stunningly filmed and acted movie graciously leads you to. Pitt and DiCaprio have never been better, Pitt stealing the show with his laconic, laid back stunt man, the sounding board, best friend and drinking buddy of a washed up tv actor, played charmingly and disarmingly by DiCaprio. Every shot looks wonderful, 1969 comes to life in technicolour splendour and by the end of this movie, you're in love with the leads. Tarantino's best movie since \"Pulp Fiction\". Praise to Margot Robbie as a luminous Sharon Tate and all the ensemble cast. Best movie of the year and a must see even if you weren't around in the 60s!", "A must-watch for anyone who's interested in Hollywood's film history": "The film plays in the 60s. The main character Rick Dalton is a fictional actor asserting himself in a fictional TV series called 'Bounty Law' with on board his stunt double Cliff Booth. The story just tells us how Hollywood's film industry has been one day in all his amusing scurrility. Tarantino presents his penultimate movie in a pettifogging way which is maybe a bit too long-winded. Tarantinos typically exaggerated brutality comes actually only at one scene shortly before the end, which not unattendedly needed to be, but that's Quentin Tarantino", "Once upon a time in \"Boredom\"": "As much as I love Tarantino's previous works, with Django and Inglorious Basterds being my absolute favorites, this work is simply a 3 hours waste of time.Bet let me start with the good first: The cinematography is good, not great, just good. The cast of course is a fine bunch of the finest actors, I mean you got Brad Pitt, Leo Di Caprio, Margot Robbie and even Al Pacino and even Luke Perry (RIP).And then, there's the not so good stuff. What's the story of this movie? Anyone? Oh and please don't come up with \"well you gotta figure it out for yourself\".To me it just looks like Tarantino somehow got the financing together, had no real idea or clou what he was gonna do, packed these nonsense blabla lines into some retro looking picture and voila: Once upon a time in Hollywood. I was bored to death the first two hours and towards the end I thought, alright not bad, but still very very mediocre.As mentioned before, the actors are great. The Brad/Leo team rocks, the story sucks and never ever does this movie come close a shred to Tarantinos other movies.", "Worst Tarantino Yet": "As a huge QT fan that shares his love of cinema and is inspired by his life story, a movie with some of the most famous actors working in Hollywood today about a topic QT feels passionately about seemed like an instant classic waiting to happen. Unfortunately though, we are left sorely disappointed, having witnessed the weakest QT outing yet.While no one can question the production quality or the research that went into this, and while he surely does show his adoration for the period, QT seems to forget that movies should have a plot, which he only seems to remember the last 15 minutes of the film.\nHow many times must we see a montage of a character driving a car with great 60s music playing in the background? Or better yet, can we still have those but also have some plot sprinkled in between? And remember that rising tension that ends in ultraviolence that Tarantino is so famous for? Well we get neither here, or rather we get both, but in separate scenes, making the tension seem unnecessary and the ultraviolence undeserved.And while the characters seem like they could have been very interesting if fleshed out, do we need to have all of these characters in the movie even if none of them seem to contribute to the (admittedly nonexistent) plot in any way?\nAnd I don't mind changing history at all, but then do we need to have all the participants of the actual event in the movie if we don't have the actual event? Do we really need to spend 20 minutes with an airhead version of Sharon Tate just so that QT can trick us by changing how the story goes?Somehow this felt both like watching an indie director struggle to stretch a short film script into a feature length movie and like a collection of QTs vignettes to a time he cares for, and not at all like the Tarantino we came to know and love.", "Tarantino's just flexing at this point": "QT does his best Coen Brothers impression, and boy does it work. Who knew he could do muted but emotionally expressive stuff.", "Dream come true.": "Oh what a movie! It was a dream come true for me to see both of my favourite actors together.\nAnd the speed of the movie was absolute perfection. Attention to details were next level of perfection.\nThe charecter's and their perfect way the role was played by each of the actors were demanded to absolute perfection by Tarantino.It was the best 3 hours of my life. And I didn't even know it was almost 3 hours. I didn't even watch the trailers or teasers or anything related to this movie.Not knowing what it even is about, is the perfect way to watch any movie and this was blowing my brain into pieces since the start.Ohh the acting, the dialogues, the movements everything was crazy crazy good.Apologies for freaking out on the reviews, but very rarely some movies takes me to this kind of happiness.", "Beyond Words": "Just go watch it. Everything about this film is phenomenal. From the musical choices, the dialogue, camera angles(the box office scene may be my favorite scene of the film), to how the mood changes based on which story you're telling; Quentin has done it again. This film will be studied for years to come, guaranteed.", "A Real Big Bore.": "Is this some new kind of art form to bore the audience to death.", "ANOTHER CLASSIC": "This is a \"hang out movie\" through and through. Meaning It's not particularly plot driven... its laid back, chill, and all about hanging with these characters. Think \"Rio Bravo\", \"El Dorado\", or Tarantino's own \"Jackie Brown\". It's all about the little moments. So if you're into that you may dig this. For me, I found it very refreshing...The movie is about a washed up TV western actor played by Leo DiCaprio and his stuntman played by Brad Pitt. Its 1969 in Hollywood, California. Let the adventures begin...Both Leo and Brad have strong chemistry and give excellent performances in this. Leo is funnier than he has ever been, and Brad gives one of his best performances I've seen from him. Its an engrossing 160 minutes full of heart, humor, and unexpected twists. Thoroughly enjoyable and a world I want to revisit again to hang out in.", "Everything that sometimes makes a Tarantino movie unwatchable.": "People that philosophize about their boring lives. Attention to details only he can understand. Weird storytelling and directing. Lots of drawn out scenes, making the movie last longer than it should. Even the cast wasn't impressive or captivating. They just delivered their lines like it was rehearsal. So you don't get into the action either. It's a big fail alright, no wonder it wasn't very successful.", "Unpredictable and inspired": "This movie, was a wild ride were i couldn't predict anything about the plot, but yet it still managed to have a great ending. It had unique characters, presentation, and plot. I would highly recommend this movie to tarintino fans and everyone else. Its very similar to pull fiction.", "Fantastic Character Piece. Not for everyone.": "This film, like all Tarantino films presents a masterclass in filmmaking and especially acting. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are absolutely fantastic together. Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate was good, but her scenes didn't quite feel like they belonged and definitely could have been trimmed down to shorten the run time.\nThis film is weak on plot, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Instead, it focuses on the characters and their place in the world. The lack of a proper plot may cause people to lose interest but I feel that the great acting, interesting characters and fantastic dialogue will keep people invested and interested.Don't come into this movie expecting a film about the Manson cult as they really aren't in the film very much; Manson himself only appears in one scene. As previously stated, the focus is on Rick and Cliff's friendship and lives.\nThe film culminates in an absolutely amazing way and was one of my favourite scenes from all of Tarantino's films. I'd heard that there was some controversy around the ending, but I totally disagree with all of it. The ending is the perfect way to cap off a slow burn movie. This film also has an awesome soundtrack. The music, sets and costumes really take you back to the 60s.This film shows that Tarantino still has it. The only real criticisms I have are Sharon Tate's scenes feeling unnecessary, the film being a tad too long, and a long scene of narration that gives a lot of exposition.", "The Benefits of Fiddling with Facts - severe spoilers alert": "Strange and wonderful things may be achieved through postmodernism. Since one of the features of the genre (for want of a better word) is making us aware that we're watching fiction rather than fact, anything goes, and Tarantino uses this to great effect in his ninth film. Not much plot is needed as long as we are aware that we are heading for the grizzly Manson massacre on Cielo Drive in August 1969. As in other films that deal with actual events (the Titanic, Gallipoli, etc.), the aspect of \"who'll survive\" is enough to provide dramatic tension, and in fact, any further plot may appear downright redundant. Our awareness that we are witnessing the final days of our characters will provide depth and put even the most trivial things in a tragic light. When we watch Sharon Tate childishly revelling in the audience's response to her own awful movie \"The Wrecking Crew\" in a cinema and being so eager to let people know that she's in it, this inspires pity and sympathy for the poor sausage.\nDiCaprio and Pitt deliver a truly touching double portrait of a fading movie star and his loyal stunt double, a Hollywood Don Quixote and his Sancho Panza, with the dog Brandy thrown in for good measure as Rosinante. DiCaprio is battling a declining popularity, as well alcohol and a sincere and justified doubt in his talent, and Pitt is under a cloud after having caused the death of his wife (but the act itself is elegantly eclipsed since we cut away, sixties style, a split second before it occurs).\nThe Manson gang members are looming in the background and provide a rare reminder that the hippie movement was not only peace and love, but also the hatred of those who made it in Hollywood, which would eventually lead to the slaughter of Tate and her friends, as well as the Labiancas on the following day. We are left wondering, as we move along, if Pitt, DiCaprio and his Italian wife will count among the victims instead of the Labiancas.\nAnd then, lo and behold, amid a flurry of other postmodern features (intertextuality, as when Tate buys a copy of Hardy's \"Tess of d'Urbervilles\" - of which Polanski would later make a film - from a bookseller played by the erstwhile matin\u00c3\u00a9e idol Clu Gulager, and little elements of pastiche including commercials and musical numbers), Tarantino spares our main characters when Don Quixote, Sancho Panza and Rosinante step into character and butcher the hateful hippie in graphic details. Just as we were wondering whether Tarantino might let us get through this film without any gore.\nIn this sense, postmodernism can be said to rectify reality (as when Hitler got shot to pieces in \"Inglourious Basterds\"), but it cannot be said truly to prettify the story by providing historical facts with the happy ending for which Hollywood is traditionally (and often unjustly) blamed - for we still know that Tate and her friends were viciously massacred in August 1969. Postmodernism never claims to tell the true story. What Tarantino has done is rather the reverse of the postmodern \"Atonement\" (2007) which ends in the long-awaited reunion of the lovers, and then adds, as an afterthought, that this ending is fiction, since both died separately before they were united. Tarantino provides a different kind of catharsis, and we are grateful for it.By the way, films don't often show us the gritty downside of the hippie culture. In fact, I can only think of one episode of \"Mad Men\" in which Betty visits a rat-infested, dirty commune in New York. But in \"Once upon a Time in Hollywood\", Tarantino doesn't pull any punches.", "I love Tarantino!": "There nothing much more to say than its a Tarantino movie. The story of a Hollywood actor and its stunt double. You have all the Tarantino ingredients: Great build up, amazing actors and a very unorthodox story. I can only recommend this movie.", "Absolute garbage": "This film is extremely poor on almost every level. It has no conventional plot whatsoever. We are thrown into the life of two Hollywood has-beens and are forced to watch insignificant details of their daily lives. This goes on for roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes until out of nowhere, the movie decides to go down an alternate reality version of the Manson family murders. Tarantino has extremely poor judgment and taste to use this terrible tragedy for marketing gimmick for this film. As I have already said, this film has no actual story line. There is no conflict going on. There are no problems for the central characters to resolve. There is no hero or anti-hero. You cannot even watch this film to gain some kind of insight into the Manson family or Charles Manson himself, or the character of Sharon Tate.The only interesting thing I can say about this film is a broad point about American society and cult worship. America, more than any other society, falls into traps of worshiping cult figures who are morally questionable. Charles Manson, David Koresh, you could even say Donald Trump. You could even argue that the Tarantino has his own little cult going on, especially given the poor quality of his films and the extremely positive reactions to them. Let us be clear - this film is utter garbage but it still has so many positive reviews and a high score on IMDB. There is something intellectually lazy about the cult mentality that must appeal to the Americans.", "This Movie Was Good But I Wish They Added More To The Sharon Tate Story": "This was another great film by Quentin Tarantino. Even though Cliff and Rick were not real people, I love how he made Sharon Tate and the Manson girls get involved in this fictional story even though the two were not real and the other ones were. Although I will say, I wish they would have stayed more true to the actual Charles Manson murders. In the end, Rick Dalton kills and beats Tex and someone else and he burns Sadie. However I have noticed that that part was supposed to take place the day before Sharon and her friends got murdered. The ending shows him going to Sharon's place and the both walk into her house to have a drink together. However I wish they would have shown the brutal murders at the end, but it makes sense why they couldn't because it would make the movie longer. As bad as that sounds, I wish they could have shown it because that was what legit happened to her and her friends. But I know Tarantino always bases it on real things that happened but adds new things to the story that didn't happen. Overall, this movie was great and if you wanna see a fictional version of 1960s Hollywood, check it out. Well okay, it is half fiction half nonfiction because most of the Sharon Tate parts were true minus her knowing Rick Dalton. I give it an 9 out of 10.", "Tarantino brought 60s to life": "What can I say except for thank you Quentin. Thank you for that masterpiece that you delivered. New genre is definitely created. Cinematography, choreography and costumography are beyond my expectations. As for the acting goes, it's superior. The chemistry between Brad and Leonardo is awesome. One true bromance. And, of course, let's not forget about Margot as Sharon. She was adorable. Everyone nailed their roles completely.\nAnd I must say special thanks to Leonardo for bringing his character beyond any boundaries. Rick Dalton is officially my favourite movie character. Oh, and the ending is practically breathtaking. Wow, I mean WOW.\nBut folks, be careful. Why I say that? Simply because not everyone are a fan of the sixties and the vibe that they are bringing. And if you are not familiar with the story of Charles Manson and Manson family you will be genuinely confused. So, take some research before the movie.\nOverall, if you love Tarantino you will love this. This movie lived up to the hype:)", "Why do we all have to suffer because of Quentin Tarantino's foot fetish??": "We get it QT, you like raised up feet and looking at the underside of feet. We know you you like women's feet pressing on the windshield of a car. Why do we all have to suffer for your fetish? Since it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, we all will go see it. However if I had known this was about the Manson Family I probably never would have gone as there's already too many shows about them and frankly I can't understand America's obsession with them. It's like Britain's obsession with Henry VIII and Ann Boleyn. If I knew this was QT revisionist history about the Manson Family then I most likely would never have gone. Way to trick the audience QT. And the trailer stating \"The ninth film from Quentin Tarantino\"......I mean how pretentious is that?", "Another great one from Tarantino!!!": "So it's basically a multi-event film. It doesn't have a particular direction. Great screenplay and cinematography. As far as performance is concerned I was more impressed by Brad Pitt. The way he carry himself in the film was really amazing to watch. He was really very cool. Same goes with DiCaprio, the portrayal of his character as a faded television star was very funny and gave a really consistent performance throughout. According to its genre it had the most unpredictable climax ever.", "Tarantino's worst film": "Great cinematography, scenery, and acting...but, pointless story that goes nowhere. One great 10m scene at the ranch where you think 'ok now it's going somewhere' then it just...doesn't.", "Overrated": "About all the critics that I have I never didn't understand what was the sense of Margot character. I think this is the first film of Tarantino that make no sense. It look like Tarantino wrote this under Dorito's effects. Brad come on you're better Thant that how do you accept interpreting this character as also DiCaprio. I think maybe this was a personal favor of Margot and Discaprio to Quentin and Brad. And this were nominated to the Oscars......", "Don't Waste 2,40Hours of Your Life": "Me and my Wife like Tarantino and Di Caprio and Brad Pitt as much.\nI still can't believe ,Tarantino wrote this awful,meaningless script and furthermore Di Caprio and Pitt accepted to play on this movie!!!\nAs the time was passing, i was saying to myself now it's gonna start...but never this movie started something!!!\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201d\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201d\nI am a very big fan of Bruce Lee also and this was a very bad and disrespectful move from production, to show that Bruce was cocky and arogant..!!!\nVery far away from the truth..Just speak with people who knew Bruce Lee..\n\u00f0\u0178\u2020\u02dcJust Keep away from this pointless movie.\u00f0\u0178\u2020\u02dc", "You're a good friend, Cliff": "02:24:00 - 02:39:00.

In any case if you love movies, and a certain era of cinema in particular you might struggle to be disappointed.Some reviewers said it dragged a little in the middle - it didn't for me.Some others said that Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate had too little to say or do, whereas I felt she was great, and just about everything she needed to be, perfect actually, with consideration to other things going on around her, and it's not really about her. Though there is a lovely quality to her presence overall... right into \"Once Upon a Time...\"Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio are great, and every other big name's relatively small part was never a waste of screen time.I recall reading that Tarantino had considered a longer cut, and I hope that emerges at some point down the line.Anyway, go and see it!Got an 18 in the UK for strong violence and gore, which appears to be predominantly subject to scenes of movies within the movie, and in that regard it's rating might seem a little too heavy - I swear! ;-)", "Once upon blah blah": "Really? This is supposed to be a Quentin Tarantino picture? While I was watching it in a pretty full theatre, two couples walked out way before the famous ending. I don't know what went wrong here...there's not much going on, except for observing this endless struggle one of the main characters is going through, which after a while becomes tedious and unbearable to watch. When that ending finally starts to unfold, you can't help but wonder what could've been if the entire movie had been that good and intriguing. In spite of previously mentioned, the acting is superb. There is one suspenseful scene before the ending, that almost felt like watching a horror film all of a sudden, which I liked a lot. I understand that a lot of stuff is a nod or a homage to that golden age of Hollywood, however, I don't like how it is represented, especially a certain scene where real Bruce Lee is shown in an unflattering light, undeservingly so, which is perhaps done on purpose or not. Maybe it was supposed to have been ironic, but somehow that irony got lost on me. This film needs shorter run-time. Sometimes it's almost as if one's watching a documentary, minus the incredible ending.", "Was there a story?": "WTF was that?At almost three hours long there should have been a story.It seemed blathering to blather.I guess I am one of those that don't get it.The only thing enjoyable was the ending. Finally some action!", "The power of the near last energy": "Fun and also twist of the fate of Sharon Tate. Great creation of Rick Dalton & Cliff Booth", "A New Top 10": "I was 20 in 1969. I have been to the Melody Ranch and used to horseback ride at the Spahn Ranch. I went to movies in Westwood and have been to all the restaurants in the movie. Therefore I feel that this movie was almost written for me. Love it. I just saw it for the second time today. It is a period piece like no other. Great acting and script. Pure Tarantino. His handling of the Manson Family is truly scary. Those in their late 60's and early 70's should eat it up. Younger viewers may not relate as well. Especially great for me was the recreation of the Spahn Ranch. FYI, it was done on the vacant Corriganville land 3 miles west of the original location.", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Review": "This was kind of a disappointment for me. Don't get me wrong, I still like the film but it just wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be. Here are the negatives. The film is structured weirdly which leads to the film being paced weirdly. Some scenes just kind of cut away to a flashback. One scene features Bruce Lee and Brad Pitt's character but you realize it is a flashback and it feels off. The film then montages through 6 months with narration. It feels out of place in this film and takes a little bit of interest out of the film. The scenes with Margot Robbie are kind of pointless. They don't serve to move the story forward. The film just comes to a dead stop when she appears on screen. For a Quentin Tarentino film, it is just a tad bit too long. Since the film is long, at some point in the second act, you start to feel a little bored which isn't a good thing for a Tarentino film. Here are the positives. The acting is phenomenal. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt do fantastic jobs in their roles and have amazing chemistry together. DiCaprio has an especially hard job of playing the role of Rick Dalton and playing the characters that Rick Dalton plays. It's genuinely impressive.Margot Robbie, even though most of her scenes are pointless, also does a fantastic job. Even all of the supporting characters who are only on screen for a short amount of time do a great job. There is not one bad performance. The story can be a little confusing at times but it's mostly easy to follow. The film is more of a character study of DiCaprio's character and Pitt's characters rather than a plot driven story which is refreshing. The ending of the film, without going into spoilers is so awesome and shocking that you are sitting there with either this huge grin on your face or you are about to throw up. The dialogue feels natural mainly because it is a Tarantino film. The soundtrack is fantastic and uses some really good songs from the late 60's. The production design is fantastic. Tarantino managed to make every aspect of the film feel like 1969 even down to the costumes and vehicles. The film is actually pretty funny too. There are a bunch of moments in the film where I was laughing a lot. The cinematography is good and there are a couple of really good shots and transitions. The film's tone remains fairly consistent. Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood may be a little too long and weirdly structured but showcases fantastic performances, great characters, and great production design while still showing that Tarantino is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood. I give Once Upon a Time in Hollywood an 8/10.", "A Bittersweet Fairytale": "Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, and the standard he set himself with his previous work and without a doubt this movie has lived up to it. The characters are well-written and explored in great detail and acted amazingly, especially by Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt.The movie has a very distinct tone. It's a mood-film that serves as an experience to drop into. Setting a tone and exploring the scenery, period and characters seems to be primary next to Story and I love that. Whereas I think some people may have a problem with the scenes playing more to developing a world rather than telling a story, I loved each set-piece and small story that took place.There's definitely some pacing issues with the beginning but the way the third act is written and the tone of the middle section makes up for it. I especially love how fairytale the movie is, everything is very perfect and intentionally cheesy which fits in with the title beginning with \"Once Upon a Time,\". This is a movie that takes place in its own movie world, where everything plays out like movies do but in reference to a real life event, something horrible and completely unfairytale, since movies, especially ones from the 60s, are meant to be, distractions from the horrific reality. This movie takes something horrible and inserts two cheesy action heroes into it, mocking the escapism found in classic cinema.The movie has beautiful cinematography and editing choices and a very neatly-chosen soundtrack. It may be too slow-paced in certain parts but that's something I can get behind\n9/10", "A superb, almost perfect movie that ended in a way I wish were true.": "Tarantino not only carried the Ball, but planted a field goal with this fantastic example of storytelling.It tells a kind off fictional tale parallel to real life, and takes one of Hollywood's biggest tragedies (I speak of the death of the beautiful and kind Sharon Tate at the hands of the Manson family), and gives it a much more heroic ending.Basically, the three murderers of Tate and her friends in the home of Roman Polanski that took place in 1969, were interrupted by a fictional Character (Rick Dalton, an old-school western actor, played brilliantly by Leo DeCaprio). So the three would-be murderers attempt to kill him instead of Tate. However when they make the attempt, they are met with Cliff Booth (A second fictional character, a ultra-masculine stuntman and Rick's oldest friend). Booth, buzzing off his nut on an Acid dipped cigarette he purchased earlier in the movie. Questions the three murderers, and when they attack...HE ABSOLUTLEY OWNS THEM IN THE MOST HEROIC AND HILARIOUS WAY... (Using his Pit Bull dog, a can of dogfood, and when Rick works out what's going on... A flamethrower.This scene had me cheering and laughing.The ending is heartbreaking, when Sharon Tate asks Rick what happened, then recognises him from his old TV show, and invites him up for drinks.If I could travel back in Time, I'd go back to that fateful day, tell Clint Eastwood and his stunt double to be there on that date, and tell Cliff \"Tell the hippies to Fxxk off\"", "An anomaly": "I'll keep it brief... Unlike so many others I've seen on this filmIf you gave this movie a smidgen less than 10 stars, you're either BRAIN DEAD or unforgivably STUPID. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are master's of their craft. I mean an ACTOR playing an ACTOR who isn't that good of an ACTOR. But just through something unforseen becomes a great ACTOR. Jeeeeezuz that's crazy good stuff.Pitt wouldn't have been on my radar to play this part if I'd only known the script. That's why he's. Sooooooo freaking good at his job... I promised to keep it short so I wi...", "Goes on and on": "The first 2 hours of this movie has no plot.

One of the most pleasant, yet terrifying experiences I have ever had in a movie theater!", "Another Tarantino's pointless sadistic garbage": "I understand that Tarantino has fun making movies for himself, but this time this was so irritating and boring and pointless and this bloody scene every Tarantino's fan likes; but not me; I don't really think it is funny. Besides this, I can say that this movie has no plot at all and this supposed black comedy point of view is just disgusting. Definitely the worst Tarantino's movie. That happens when you leave an egocentric arrogant fake genius to do whatever he wants with the money of others, in this case fool producers' money and maybe himself. Maybe this movie is a masterpiece for someone who only wants to take some laughs and enjoys seeing young girls being smashed or burned to death. As I said, not a serious movie at all.", "Half Polanski/Manson fairy tale / Half goofy pointless \"plot\"": "Ok. Picture Inglorious Bastards but much more boring. Shots of Sharon Tate watching her own film in a theater. Brad Pitt driving around LA. DiCaprio is mad because he keep fucking up as an actor in the film. Why would anyone care about these characters? Tarantino feels that an eight year old girl (that looks at least ten) who reads well and is a snotty brat for Hollywood purposes is a stroke of genius. Newsflash Quentin. No one cares. This film had competent acting.. although I thought that DiCaprio hammed it up at times. Some people have stated that this is Tarantino's best.", "My favourite Tarantino film.": "Before I properly start I can understand why someone wouldn't prefer this Tarantino film maybe because it had a different structure to the other films. The main reason why I thought it was as good as I thought it was, was due to the fact I had prior knowledge on the context of this film (Manson murders). I thought it was crucial to have a bit of insite to really get into the film. For example Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) had a completely different role in the film as to real life, Tarantinos twist really changed my views.Moving on, the performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt where outstanding and probably my favourite from them. Furthermore the ending was definitely the best in my opinion and in Tarantino style it was pure violence. It started of with a drugged up Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) fending off the hippies who vowed to kill the actors as their was to kill the people who are on TV and would kill other actors which just sounds barbaric. Tarantino does a brilliant job in villainising the politically incorrect characters (the hippies) and the brutal ending scene is definitely what they deserve.", "To understand this film, you have to know history": "It is amazing how Tarantino took the hot topics of 1969 of Hollywood and transformed it into one story: The shifting of Hollywood into the new era, the rise of the hippies and the Manson family's murders.The lead characters are fictionals but the rest of the characters are based on real people. Tarantino took the real story, added two fictional, relatable characters and changed the outcome of the real tragic event like he previously does in Inglorious Basterds and Django.The directing and cinematography are amazing. Tarantino did this movie for himself and not for the fans. He created his art in his way, how he likes it and did not think about the critics or the majority of the fans which are used to like certain types of movies only.He invests in his characters and scenes. Many scenes can be cut out and not hurt the story but he kept them because of the different directing style of the scenes although it has nothing to do with the story.Tarantino used many different directing styles. He mixed many methods from old Hollywood and the new. If you are familiar with old and recent movies you will notice it.There are also too many pop culture references which i loved. If you are fan of oldies than you will love it.The performance by the leading actors were fascinating. Leonardo is known for his perfect acting in every character he takes over but Brad Pitt stole the show. We are used to see oscar worthy performance from DiCaprio but Pitt carried the story on his shoulder. I hope both of them get oscar notes. If leonardo gets it and Pitt not, then it will be really unfair. I am sure 100 percent that Tarantino will get oscar nomination for his directing. Margaret did not have too many lines in the movie but she delivered her character's story with only acting. In many scenes she only acted and did not talk and still told the story. Now that's acting. I hope she get noticed and nomination too by the Academy Awards.This movie is not for everyone. People who understand Hollywood and movies will enjoy it but for the people who enjoys only Marvel movies, it's not your movie to watch.", "I will give it 1 star for making the Great Bruce Lee a junk": "A fight included a person who wasn't fictional. any defences from the director is just non-sense.", "He's done it again, folks!": "What a stunning movie!

Well done Mr Terroni.", "It is Tarantino's slowest film, but in this pacing, an exquisite, immersive setting flourishes in the limelight - a true love letter to the indulgence of late-60s Hollywood.": "Some viewers may be unfamiliar with the Tate Murders of 8-9 August 1969. The Manson family cult brutally murdered rising star Sharon Tate (portrayed by a captivating Margot Robbie) at her home, along with her unborn baby and four other adults. The ninth film by Quentin Tarantino, 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood', is set to the backdrop of the months leading up to this.But it is by no means a standard biographical retelling. Instead, Tarantino creates a fictitious Los Angeles story which follows ageing TV actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his long-time stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as they venture round a Hollywood they barely recognise anymore. Tarantino's ninth is a sublime, character-heavy expos\u00c3\u00a9 of celebrity culture and movie industry myths in Hollywood's golden age, which tonally is a radical shift from his previous films.If you were expecting another Tarantino feature bursting with stylized violence and witty dialogue, though, then you may be disappointed. 'Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood' substitutes the bloodlust and sharp spoken word for a commanding, tense linear narrative which engrosses itself in the development of its central characters and cultural messages. There is still violence, and plenty of excellent one-liners reserved for some outstanding delivery by DiCaprio and Pitt, but this is the work of a truly mature filmmaker who is comfortable in his artistic vision behind the camera - a masterful presence within Hollywood exploring the era which inspired his work. It is Tarantino's slowest film to date, but in this pacing, an exquisite, immersive setting flourishes in the limelight - a true love letter to the indulgent climate of late-1960's Hollywood.From the start, Rick Dalton is established as a character that audiences can associate with, and viewers are thrown into his world as he comes to realise that he's no longer a relevant presence. Tarantino crafts such a compelling narrative around Dalton's battle with his insecurities that shelving the impending Manson murders feels oddly appropriate. The glamorously meticulous detail in the recreation of late-60s Hollywood makes this film a pure delight to experience; Tarantino's virtuosity here is some of his best.Many scenes conclude with an overhanging shot, as if to allow the audience a moment to reflect. There's a message or two to be learned here. Tarantino once again uses flashbacks, but frequently they operate to highlight Rick and Cliff's psychology, serving as some of the craftiest scene-cuts in the whole film. Robbie may not have many lines as the alluring up-and-coming actress, but this lets the true thematic element to thrive. One can look into the horrors of the fateful evening 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' is based around, but by focussing on the minds of these fictional characters in a world riven with its own long-term embedded repulsions, Tarantino challenges viewers to form their own interpretations of the wider society it is presenting, and it works magnificently.He doesn't over-fantasise, nor does he simply recreate the idealised world of Hollywood. Instead, Tarantino gives audiences an exceptionally provocative story which allows for the most elegant escapism this year in film may see.", "The \"Most Tarantino\" Tarantino Movie": "The only bad thing about this movie is that we only have one Quentin Tarantino movie left.", "What was it?": "If it did not have 2 super stars... none would even rate the movie.\nTime and mood spoiler...

First, there is a two hour tension and storytelling that doesn't provide much to the actual plot (which is pretty much non-existent). Then comes the slaughter and quickly after that the ending credits. Not my type of movie. I am a long-time Tarantino fan and hate to see what the new production has become.", "Popcorn Empire: ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD - MOVIE REVIEW": "With Hollywood, Tarantino dives in to many previous genres he's explored, while also painting a vivid picture of late 60's California... 9/10Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's 9th feature film. Tarantino has become one of the most hightly regarded auteur filmmakers of this generation. Known for his sharply written dialogue, explosive ultra-violent action, and masterful use of tension and suspense, Tarantino is a one-of-a-kind writer/director. With Hollywood, Tarantino dives in to many previous genres he's explored, while also painting a vivid picture of late 60's California.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADRick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) have worked together in the film industry for many years. Rick is an actor known for his role in a western TV show, and Cliff is his stunt double. The film blends the story of our fictional protagonists with historical events which are altered in the script. Rick and Cliff are next-door neighbors to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha), and this comes into play in a major way at the climax of the film.Tarantino takes a meandering approach to this story, but in doing so, he sheds light on many different aspects of the setting and the characters. We experience Rick's existential crisis and eventual redemption regarding his career, we learn a lot about Cliff Booth and his history, and we spend a lot of downtime with Sharon Tate. Sharon and Rick parallel each other in interesting ways, with Rick on the decline and Sharon steadily rising as a budding Hollywood star. We see both characters revel in their work in different ways. The film often dwells on various aspects of filmmaking and the general culture and lifestyle of late 60's.As the film moves along, the various subplots slowly click into place, and the focus becomes clear: the Manson Family murders. It's obvious that Tarantino is outraged by what happened to Sharon Tate and company, as many were. He intervenes through Rick and Cliff in this fictional version of the story, saving their lives and giving the Manson family some frontier justice in classic Tarantino fashion.This is Tarantino's most personal film to date, which is shown in the tender, sympathetic way that he handles the main characters. In a sense, Rick and Cliff both are representative of Tarantino in different ways. He's dreading an eventual obsolescence as a filmmaker, and is coming to terms with his career eventually ending. But like Cliff, he's not here for the fame; he simply wants to do his work and be content with that. The interplay between the two characters seems to reconcile these concerns in a way, and things end on a bittersweet note.The cast all around give excellent performances, with nuanced characterization and lots of charm. Hollywood is essentially a buddy comedy with a dark streak, packed with gallows humor and hilarious dialogue. There's a lot of laughs, especially in the explosive third act where things get downright gruesome (in a very satisfying way). The action is sparse, but extremely fun when it kicks in, and all of the faux TV and movie clips are very entertaining.Clocking in at almost 3 hours, Hollywood is slow but never boring. If you're willing to sit back and soak in all of the small details that make this film so rich and entertaining, it's very much worth your time, despite being a tad overlong. It's not Tarantino's best, but that's hardly a criticism. If you've remotely enjoyed any of Tarantino's previous work, definitely catch this one in theaters.9/10", "Character driven story": "Like other movies or shows this is a film where the plot takes a back seat for us to enjoy the characters and their interactions between each other. It's a fun film with beautiful cinematography and music. But I have one flaw and that's Margot Robbie. She doesn't really have a point to the film. You take her out and u lose nothing really. But Brad Pitt is having such a good time I couldn't care.\nREPEAT. iF YOU ARE EXPECTING PLOT GET OUT THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU.", "Road to nowhere": "I have a friend who is very much into Heavy Metal, a topic that I am also interested in, but to a much lesser extend. Everytime I go visit this friend, he pulls out new albums, shows me exciting coverart, small musical easter eggs on certain songs and just keeps on talking. Even after an hour or two, he usually still is into his monolouge of gods and demi gods of Metal. He does not really finish a story he starts, he just jumps from one crazy thing to the next, we don't listen to any full song, just certain riffs and solo. I had the same feeling with this Tarantino movie. Yes, the 60s were awesome, yes Tarantino has probably delved deep into the topic, but everything is so random. Look! There is Bruce Lee, look! The Playboy mansion. Look! Deep Purple on the radio. Look! Girls didn't shave their arm pits. - Interesting, but so what.Tarantino again fails to deliver an exciting enough story to keep me interested. All the scenes seem random, characters get introduced, then just disappear. There are lots of good ideas introduced then just dropped. Tarantino builds up suspense out of thin air (like when Pitt comes to the Mansion ranch), but what was it all about? No explaination, no real danger, no solution, no nothing.There are new elements over and over again without following any of them through. A Narrator sets in from time to time but who is he? What for? The dialogues are still tarantino-ish, but often seem to have lost all purpose. Even the cool names Tarantino is famous for (From Fox Force Five to the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) are now just sad and uninspired.Tarantino constantly drops names of actors, movies and series, but for what? Am I supposed to know them all? Then there is no real plot and nobody does anything of consequence, no development. Even late in the movie new characters are introduced that bring nothing to the movie. The music seems uninspired and randomly picked, adding nothing to the scenes. Tarantinos movies used to be in sum more than their individual parts, but this time they just don't fit together.I give it 3 stars because of the acting and the ending, but you cannot deny that this is a bad, lengthy movie that does not care for the audience.Tarantino urgently needs to reinvent himself, maybe venturing into new genres. I'd be happy to see a Sci-Fi-Tarantino (Alien 5(!)), but Quentin should stay away from nostalgia. He has told all he could about the past.", "What was the point?": "During the first 2 Hours of the movie I was more interested in the hair of the man in front of me at the cinema. No storyline or action whatsoever from that. Then it skips to 6 months later or more (I can't honestly remember) and then there's a bit of action but nothing to do with the story so far. The action was pretty funny and gory to be fair but then it ends and you can't quite figure out what you've watched.\nBrad Pitt was pretty good. Di Caprio and Margot Robbie have been payed to act really well with no intent of giving their characters anything to do.\nMaybe it was just a movie for older people or fans of westerns, maybe it all went over my head, but most likely it was the most boring movie I have ever watched. I'd say it's not worth watching again to figure it all out.\nAlso if my dad watches this (and he loves westerns), he'll be asleep within the first 10 minutes.", "Guys at least be honest.": "Sure, i do not really understand 10* rating, nor those 1*.

They did well.", "Tarantino is a genius when it comes to making incredible movies.": "One of the best crafted movies I've ever seen. Tarantino is brilliant. I love all his movies, but this one is special- everything comes together just right in this one. You feel transported back to the time of 1969, so different than today. Awesome acting, music, everything. There are only a few tiny things that ticked me off, but could easily be overlooked by the greatness of the whole film. I'm speaking of the wrongly cast and poor acting of Zoe Bell, who, just like in the Hateful Eight, stood out in a bad way. Tarantino certainly is loyal to her, but he should make her take a ton of acting classes so she doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. Also, like the Hateful Eight, my absolute personal favorite of Tarantino's films, there is an irritating narration done to quickly get through a certain section of the movie. This time its Kurt Russell. Since Tarantino felt another narration was needed (which I don't), he at least could have used the groveled cowboy voice of Sam Elliot. That would've fit better, but the narrations just don't work in my opinion. Everyone knows Quentin Tarantino films contain an excessive amount of f-bombs, which suits his style just fine, but I'd love to know how many times it was said in this one because it had to of broken a Guinness world record. Anyway, great movie- Pitt's character was something else. It did bother me they said he killed his wife though, which was quite believable after watching his power and violence with everyone else. Poor Bruce Lee. Margot Robbie was beautiful, and Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was stellar. Everyone should be smart and see this movie; just, remember it is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece, so you know the language and bloody violence is going to be............AWESOME. See it!", "Absolute Garbage, I Was Falling Asleep. That's How Bad It Was.\u00f0\u0178\u2018\u017d": "Whenever You Start Falling Asleep during a Movie, That's Bad.That's How Bad It Was.What An Absolute Letdown.", "Quentin's \"Roma\"": "The Good: The headline said this is Quentin's \"Roma\". By this, I mean that not much happens plot-wise in this film other than the end, as we mainly follow the characters throughout their lives. While some may say that this is boring, I would argue that the lead characters are so engaging that this does not matter.Case in point, Rick Dalton, a has-been actor fighting his demons, is a complex character brought to life by Leonardo Dicaprio. His casting in this film is brilliant as he shows an air of patheticness not usually associated with his persona. What I particularly appreciated about the character is that he appears to have a stutter when he is not acting, and the movie never definitively answers what causes it? Is it his alcoholism; nerves and anxieties of being a has-been; something else? This casting also contributes to the themes of the film, which shows and tells us how appearances to the audience make or break careers.This brings us to Sharon Tate, the rising starlet brought to life brilliantly by Margot Robbie. While there has been some controversy over the amount of lines Robbie was given, I would argue that her role in this film is not at all diminished by this. She portrays the innocence and joys of acting, and her silent acting brings a pathos to the film, especially as we the audience know what is going to happen to her in real life.Finishing off the trio of powerhouse acting is Cliff Booth, who brings immense likeability to his role. This shades his character, as we find out early in the film that he may have killed his wife. Bringing tension to every scene he is in, as we are not sure about his stability, and also shades his violent outburst at the end of the film; was it really self-defense for him, or something he has done before? In addition, this also adds even more to the theme of public perception that is throughout the film.Finally, it has to be mentioned that the production of this film is top-notch. Quentin and the crew went above and beyond to catch an era, and while I was not born remotely near the 60's, the love for the time period is apparent in every little detail the film captures.The ending has drawn lots of controversy, which I still have not drawn a verdict on. For what it's worth, this violent scene is very quick and not drawn-out, as reviewers have made it out to be, and is surprisingly funny in the context of the film with an excellent callback. Ultimately, the scene feels like it is condoning rather than celebrating Cliff's actions, and Quentin's past films have shown that he is not someone to be squeamish regarding violence.The Bad: The only actively bad thing about this movie are the constant shots of feet in this film that is a very off-putting decision.Movie Highlight: Cliff at the compound. What a great scene filled with rising tension where I had no idea of what would happen.Conclusion: Another Quentin Tarantino masterpiece.

I tell you guys: THIS IS A HANG-OUT MOVIE!\nI watched this movie twice already and i feel want to watch it over and over again. For me 161 minutes is very short to enjoy the vibe of 1960's City of Angels, and feel like I'm hanging-out with the characters while watching this movie.

So he wanted the ending to be different, he would like those people could live, that baby could be born, just like us all.

During the first 1/2 hour audience memo were laughing out loud and my friend was ready to leave, I suspected from the previews that it wouldn't necessarily be about anything so I settled in, then Polanski pulled out if his driveway and I got the first hit of what we were in for. I had forgotten at this point that it was a fairy tale and how Tarantino rewrites history (d'jango, inglorious; it's along those lines) so during the ending I kept thinking 'this is disrespectful , this is so disrespectful'. But was the lack of violence up to that point ,including the surreptitious, probably misunderstood, nod to Bruce my baby, really more about the use of violence? Ultimately though, the movie kept me locked in that unfortunate seat and now three days later (and a lot more than usual has happened in my life ) I am surprised to wake up with this in my head : Sharon Tate (Robbie) crossing the street to the movie theater, I mean, Q brought her back to life in the sweetest way! Growing up in the early 70's we knew all about the Tate-LaBianca murders and by the 80's you had your guys who were were obsessed with this case: the people the ranch and the events that unfolded. We've spent valuable time in the hills too and so it was nostalgic to be around there in the film and the acting was truly wonderful. It was a solid film, it wasn't what I expected, ,but I don't know what I was expecting and had I written a review that evening it might have been different, Did I enjoy it ? That fact that I woke up compelled to give my play-by-play , that I am still thinking about it, apparently in my sleep, is proof enough.", "Fantasy with reality on the margins": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\nWritten and directed by Quentin TarantinoI love cinema. I love going to the movies. I can appreciate where Quentin Tarantino is coming from. He loves the movies as well. He loves everything about Hollywood and the movies. That is this movie. This movie is about immersing yourself in the world of Rick Dalton, a western actor doing television on his way down and his best friend/stunt man Cliff Booth who comes with his own set of baggage.This movie is a series of vignettes about different situations ranging from Cliff Booth at the Spahn Ranch with the Manson Family, Rick acting in a pilot for a new western and Sharon Tate watching herself in her movie enjoying the reactions of the crowd. This is about the process of making movies. It is about the process of watching what you create. It is the fantasy of the dream factory in a nutshell.However it is also about the process of change. Change is inevitable. Change can be painful. Change can also be good. Change can be terrifying. You have to be alright with it in some fashion otherwise it can run you over. You have to find your groove in it.I've heard this movie described as a hangout movie and this is a very apt description. You're hanging out at the movies with these characters. You're hanging out on the set watching everyone work. You're hanging out with the Manson Family. You're driving down Hollywood Blvd. You're listening to music from the 60s on the radio. You're making boxed mac and cheese while watching TV.It is these two characters' journey. All the other characters are just orbiting around them. The title is important though. The movie does take place in recognizable place and time. It features people you know but it is not reality. It is a fairy tale. It is the dream factory as I mentioned before. They live inside the fantasy. They live inside their characters. Messy reality is just outside the edges. Vietnam is briefly mentioned. You see some of the downtrodden on Hollywood.He does get into the Manson family. Not really Charles Manson though. He shows up once. It's part of the messy reality edging in through the outsides. He does something similar to what he did to the Nazis in Inglourious Basterds, the Ku Klux Klan in Django Unchained to the Manson Family. He turns them into goofballs. He saps all the menace out of them.If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, this movie is for you. If you're a fan of cinema, this movie is for you.

The brilliance displayed on screen is beyond the depths of human understanding. I feel it's so complex and simply entertaining at the same time.

That will only work so long. The audiences are no longer trusting the critics or the Oscars and soon they just won't pay for this tripe. And Hollywood... you may be obsessed with your history but no one else is. MMkkkayyy?", "Tarantino film true and true": "Tarantino is such a unique director. His unique style comes in full force in his latest film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. He also has a stellar cast to deliver this tale. Tarantino does well with the pace in this film, despite it traditionally being long you don't feel it. There is depth covered in normality as he sets the scene well, no over the top special effects or moments needed. It's almost as if he creates a deep and complex tale that the characters define and he sits back to watch. Even though Sharon Tate was a real person you feel like she could have been a more fictional character compared to Rick or Cliff.Factual events form a nice back drop to this interesting tale. Another strong feature of Tarantino films is the deviation from history. Usually humorous and works out badly for the real villains who got away. He did the same with Inglorious basterds and does the same with Sharon Tate.Overall the pace, depth and context provides great build up to an explosion of a finale that provides a funny and alternative history. 8/10", "Nothing happens and ending is VERY unsatisfying": "Just got back from watching this film and felt like nothing happened and the last 15 minutes was exactly like Inglorious Bastards where they change up history but QT has already done this and 2 previous Western type films prior and everything the viewer had been waiting for amounted to pointless unsatisfying violence.\nGreat for a film documentary for the most part but most of the picture is just 60s film and tv clips with celebrity cameos.", "Wen't in the cinemas expecting Tarantino's best, but this felt far from it.": "Sure you can say the acting was great, the costume and set designs were amazing which they were, even the fact that the film had all the actors they could get their hands on.

Just imagine watching nearly a 3hr movie with no plot.. nothing happens, the end scene was super predictable and the main reason for this film was to show off how good the acting and set designs could be. I gave it a 7 because the execution with most elements were really well done quite clearly deserves that. But if you look for a good plot with some twists here and there and good character development don't watch this with high hopes because it offers none of that.", "A slow burn exploding at the end": "This movie is slow to build a story.

Brad Pitt being the standout star for me personally he sells his character so well I almost forgot that it was Brad Pitt I was watching. DiCaprio does just as well of course. It shows a films quality when you have two amazing actors, you could argue some of the best ever, each actor has so many amazing films yet this one still can compete with those amazing titles. The movie does definitely feel like an almost three hour movie but that dident bother me enough to drop it to a nine. the atmosphere of the movie is also spot on making you feel like your in the 60s again. The climax of the film is so funny and Tarantino like (fans of his work will know what I mean) Overall this film might be Quintin Tarantino best masterpiece.

Brad Pitt is at his best as Cliff Booth, a loyal and affable friend with an unlikely strong moral compass, while conversely burdened with a dark past. Leonardo DiCaprio's perfect portrayal of Rick Dalton is so sad and earnest - his talent buried by the success of his cheesy much loved \"Bounty\" character.

It's a place that has changed faces much like the stars change make up, and to keep on top of modern trends to keep the ever-consuming monster satiated. Yet, in the shiny metropolis lies stories that aren't so flashy or happy, dramatic tales that are sad and filled with anguish that some can't handle. Yet, for directors like Quentin Tarantino it's a medium that holds potential to open the eyes of the blind. That story, or at least a comedic rendition of it, lies in this movie of our review with hopes of being a contender in the quality film industry. Robbie K here ready to give you a taste of another review as we take on:Movie: Once Upon A Time In Hollywood (2019)Director:\nQuentin Tarantino\nWriter:\nQuentin Tarantino\nStars:\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie\nLIKES:The Setting\nThe Costumes\nSpecial Effects\nThe Writing\nThe Tempered Down Tarantino Effects\nThe Acting\nThe NostalgiaDISLIKES:The Occasional rants of cursing\nThe Disproportionate Story Telling\nNeeded More Margot Robbie\nThe Pacing\nThe Run Time\nThe Ending... sort ofSUMMARYThe wow factor for this movie is the homage Tarantino paid to the glorious mega studio in so many aspects. In particular all the movie magic of effects, wardrobe, settings take you back to the classic world where so much changed, as the 60s/70s. In the fantastic setting of retro Hollywood, smart writing that is blend of drama, comedy, and smart dives into the psyche of those famous people we admired. By tempering down the Tarantino cascade, it allowed for a different film that wasn't overwhelmed by the flash in the pan effect this director flourishes in. To help further bring this message to life, the acting of the three tiled characters gets big acknowledgement, with heart throb DiCaprio bearing much of the load of the tortured actor trying to find his way in a changing world. Pitt's character was my favorite of the supporting character that was a blend of looks and comedy that went well with the supporting story, while Robbie's dive in the star trying to gain new light sort of provided the intensity relief. Yet, all of this is overpowered by the bouts of nostalgia from the various entertainment venues this time period had. Radio shows, famous songs, television programs, and all the memorabilia that referenced this was the real factor that made the movie a fun adventure filled with messages and meaning.Yet, the movie does have some cleaning up for me that would potentially make it more favorable to the general public. First of all, while Tarantino's energy has been tempered, it's not eliminated and the moments where it comes out in full rush did little for me. Minor dislike aside, the story telling, while good, is a little imbalanced, primarily in Margot Robbie's character who felt more like an incongruent tangent that only touched on the graph of this film's main plot. Because of this sort of unbalance, the movie seemed to fall in to a frame of being too slow, the pace for a nearly 3-hour film was dragging and very tiring. Much of this had to do with the bloated sequences of lots of driving, or dragged out bits of conversation that could have been left for a director's cut. Throw in the incongruent story of Margot Robbie's character and you get extra time that is not really need. Perhaps it would have been worth it had the ending gone the way I had expected, the buildup of the incident ending in that comedic violence that is both satisfying and not quite the terror I had expected. Thus, the long-winded journey did not quite have the finish that I think he was getting at.Overall, Once Upon In Hollywood is smart writing, diving into the lives of the fleeting fame that is Hollywood and how the transitions can affect one person. The special effects and settings will be the ultimate nostalgic for fans to dive into, and the acting is certainly going to have candidates in the Oscar running. Yet, the films suffers from bloated storytelling and disproportionate focus on each aspect leading to a very drawn out tale that may not be for everyone. Thus, if you are looking for the entertainment factor, this one is not worth a trip to the theater, but if you want the artistic love letter to the thing that brings so many hits, then check this one out.My scores are:Comedy-Drama: 8.5\nMovie overall: 8.0", "Movie about nothing": "Here's the movie:\nChapter I: Random people just drive around casually in their cars.\nChapter II:Random people drive around in their cars and go to movie sets where they have pointless conversations with other random people then get back in their cars and go to their apartments.\nChapter III: Random people drive around in their cars, pick up other random people and drive them to some place where nothing happens and they drive back.\nChapter IV: Absolutely nothing happens in between all this driving around.\n==================================The End", "What is wrong with you people": "Is one of the best movies in this year best acting best directing good story and best ending I have no reason to give him less than 9/10 And to the values of the film B 1 and 2 Are you wise Indian films will take a better assessment of this Stop hating", "A loving tribute to the last days of Hollywood's golden age layered with themes of fame and identity.": "Finally, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' has been released in Australia after an excruciating extra few weeks long wait where I've been avoiding discussion posts and spoilers like the plague. I saw it opening night and I had an absolute blast.This is probably Quention Tarantino's most reserved and laid back film to date, and while that may be offputing to some, I found it to be a very refreshing change from his stories driven by an insastionable quest for revenge. It is probably the closest in tone to 'Pulp Fiction' Tarantino's ever been, as the film is very story-lite and primarily depicts a day in the life of these characters, except it's linear and it continuiously cuts between the stories occurring at the same time.Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt deliver some of the best performances of their career here. Both their characters are defined by themes of fame and identity. Rick Dalton is faced with his dwindling fame as he is typecast in guest roles on Western show after Western show, which leads him struggling to find his own identity within the industry through his attempts to formulate a successful leading man film career. It's eerily similar to Leo's transition from his pretty boy persona from the 90s into the phenomenal actor he is today. Being the phenomenal actor he is though, he just unleashes a spectrum of emotions that gives his character so much sympathy, relatability and overall depth, whereas most actors would just make the character a joke. Cliff Booth on the other hand struggles to find his own individual identity due to him living in the shadow of Rick's fame. He represents the working class man in Hollywood that helps everything work, and Brad is very nonchalant and laid back. He just gives off an aura of cool.\nWhenever these two are on screen together, their dynamic is just electric to the point where it almost feels like a buddy film. Their chemistry makes it seem these two have been friends for a long time and have a massive mutual respect for each other.\nMargot Robbie was pretty great as Sharon Tate too, but she was definitely under-utilised. Her character is the antithesis to Rick and Cliff's cynical nature, as she is so high spirited and optimistic. I definitely interpreted that the themes of fame and identity are relevant to her character as well, but it doesn't unfold onscreen through a character arc like the other two leads. Instead, it let's the viewer themselves interpret her fame and identity, which is arguably defined by her tragic fate within the general public. But Tarantino completely subverts this perception of Tate which is both tasteful and respectful to her legacy.On a technical level, this film is astounding. Before seeing this, I'd say 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' was Tarantino's best looking film, but this, this just knocks out it of the park as the production design and art direction are off the chart. The fact that every single set piece has been constructed practically and is actually in front of the camera when it is being shot is an absolutely remarkable feat. It is such a breath of fresh air to see a big-budget wide-release film that does not heavily rely on CGI to create its illusions. There are so many interior shots of characters in their car driving past real locations like Cinemarama and the Chinese Theatre, or even Taco Bell, that just further solidifies the reality of this setting. The idea of the having the entire soundtrack provided by music playing on the radio and the TV is so creatively clever and ingenious. There are real advertisements and announcements from that era which act as segways between the tracks which just further immerses the viewer. You really feel like you're on a movie set. You feel like you're in Rick Dalton's house. You feel like you're in Hollywood, 1969. The setting itself is just as much of a character as the leads.The way I've been gushing about this film makes it seem like it's a flawless masterpiece, but it's not. It is a Tarantino film and all of his movies have serious flaws. There is narration introduced long into the runtime, like 'The Hateful Eight', and that is a bit off putting, but it serves a better purpose here than the former as it explains more than what is simply happening onscreen. Although the film is story-lite, this does bring about a lack of conflict and consequence for most of the film, and when drama does come into play, it can feel a little jarring and out of place. Also the fact that it is story-lite results in this film being Tarantino's least dialogue driven one yet. That's not necessarily a ditraction from the film itself, as it is more of a visual experience than a vocal one, but I find the main draw to Tarantino's films is the dialogue. There are great conversations that do take place, but I can't remember any happening for at least the first half hour. And finally, I wish Leo and Brad were onscreen together just a little bit more, as they're mostly off on their own adventures separately, which are still great, but it lacks the amount of intrigue I have when they're together. Any other problems I had would be minor nitpicks, and spoilers, but they don't really matter in the long scheme.Overall, this was definitely the most fun I've had at the cinema all year. It is certainly not Tarantino's best, but with someone who has as high as a reputation as him, you cannot hold this film to a fault when comparing it to his near flawless filmography. More importantly, however, it is one of the best films I've seen this year so far, as it is so rare and enlightening to see a big-budget wide-release movie that is an original story and has a legitimate creative force guiding it. It's a more mesmering rather than entertaining experience, and if you're just willing to sit back and chill out with it, you're gonna be in for a good time.", "This Movie Will Not Be the typical Tarantino Fest": "I wouldn't say this movie is like any Tarantino film. It really has no plot whatsoever, it's just kind of a chill movie. You kind of hang with these characters for a couple of days and watch 1969 Hollywood. It is almost like watching a documentary of 1969 Hollywood. I feel this maybe the most grounded Tarantino flick yet.The acting is top notch. Leo gives the best performance of his entire career. It is the first performance without any signs of a normal \"Leo Performance\". Brad Pitt steals the show in every scene. He IS CLIFF BOOTH. Everyone else does a magnificent job. Shout out to whoever played Bruce Lee because, WOW, they were fantastic.This movie will divide a lot of people. It has no real story, and it's more of just watch these guys do life. The only part with actual story is the last 15 mins, which is when the most TARANTINO parts occur. For the most part though, the movie is kind of just, watch these two likeable guys do stuff. It's entertaining, and never really a drag. I know a lot of people didn't like it as much because it has no real plot. People say like Pulp Fiction is no plot, but that isn't true. This movie. This movie has no plot, but it's still entertaining. I think it's the least Tarantino, tarantino film, and it's why it was truly refreshing.It's gonna divide people, but if you appreciate cinema, I IMPLORE YOU to go see this. Don't let the Lion King rule the box office.", "wow, Brad Pitt superb. IMHO, ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER!!!!!": "WOW, a movie I did not want to end. I saw it was suppose to be 4 hours. That would be fine with me. So far I have seen it twice. Will probably see it again. While all are good in their own way....IMHO...Brad Pitt just shines, and basically makes the movie. It would be, just good, with DeCaprio and someone else In the Pitt roll. The two combined, superb. Pitt, IMHO, equally as stunning, as in...Meet Joe Black, A river Runs Thru It, and Legends Of The Fall.....oh, by the way, IMHO...either you \"get\" this movie, or you dont, and probably never will. No, I was not paid to write this....or any other excuse people are using to try and justify trashing this gem. I am just a normal movie goer who appreciates excellence. Yes, I love the classic old movies. Just saw Sunset Boulevard on the big screen. You have to like an excellent, involved story.....or you will hate this masterpiece. SO, just saw this for the Third time. I did not want it to end. IMHO...this will go down in cinema history, AS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE.!!!!!!!!!", "Great, But Not The Best Tarantino": "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a grand fairy tale set in 1969 Hollywood when Hippie culture was clashing with the luxurious lifestyles of A-list celebrities who populated the area. Somewhere in the middle we have Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Pitt), a television actor and his stunt double/best friend who live somewhat modestly as Dalton struggles to make it \"big.\" Dalton is also an alcoholic, and sometimes talks with a stammer which gives off a nervous vibe for the character. Early in the movie, Dalton becomes worried that he is a \"has-been\" since the offer he is getting is to star in some Spaghetti Westerns - a genre in film that he thinks is terrible for some reason. One final thing to note is that he lives next door to Sharon Tate and, more importantly, Roman Polanski, and he thinks it would be a big opportunity for him if he were to meet the director of Rosemary's Baby.Anybody who is familiar with Tarantino can tell that in terms of cinematography, editing, and especially production design, this is clearly Tarantino at his best. There is a great sequence in the film that follows Rick Dalton as he acts in front of a camera for a Western in which he plays the antagonist. The audience is meant to see these scenes in this fictional movie as it is theoretically supposed to be edited together, but it is done in real time. At one point, when Dalton calls for a line and they have to \"reset to 1,\" it is a representation of how filmmakers actually work as the camera pulls back to its original position and dissolves the illusion of the movie within the movie that we are watching. Every shot in this sequence is masterly crafted to give us the feeling that we are still watching Hollywood and not the Western, only we are seeing it from the point of view of the camera filming the Western. Above all, the framing of each shot is spectacular.One thing that is extremely different in this movie compared to most Tarantino movies is actually the use of dialogue. Most of the dialogue in the film does not sound like Tarantino dialogue. Instead of standing out with elaborate metaphors and analogies, a lot of the dialogue simply moves the story along in Hollywood. That is not to say that the dialogue is never in the spirit of Tarantino. There is plenty of dialogue in the film that proves to make the audience laugh out loud, yet what the characters say is not particularly smart or witty in the Tarantino fashion. Regardless, it is nice to see a Tarantino movie where more focus was put on the visuals and structure of the movie rather than making sure the dialogue was top-notch the whole time.If this film shaved off about 20 or 30 minutes it would be almost perfect. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie drags since there is only a little excitement spread here and there throughout - that is, except for the last 15 or 20 minutes. The most exciting actor to watch in this movie is definitely Brad Pitt. In Inglourious Basterds, Pitt had to put on a ridiculous accent for a character who was decent at best. In this film, he does almost the opposite - Cliff Booth has a quiet and reserved nature about him, yet he is intimidating to watch once we learn about this mysterious past which disturbs other characters in the movie to think about (think Hans Landa saying \"I love rumors\" at the beginning of Basterds). Tension that is built in scenes involving Booth is the closest we ever come to a scene with the quality of the opening of Basterds. We simply do not know what Booth is going to do next when placed in dangerous situations.Overall, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood proves to be an enjoyable experience. While it feels a little too long, it is funny throughout, it looks great in terms of visuals and production design, and it has great performances by all three of its stars. It is not top-tier Tarantino, but it is a great movie nonetheless.9/10", "The Most Mature and Intelligent Tarantino Film To Date": "I just got in from watching Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. I've been a Quentin Tarantino fan since, well, Reservoir Dogs. Amid his trademark over-the-top violence and gore, I have always felt he treats the art with a respect that's often lost in controversy. His execution of heartfelt homage is so authentic that it becomes his biggest criticism, and to the less astute, is often dismissed as blatant theft.Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is the homage of all homages. Critics are calling this Tarantino's \"love letter to Hollywood\", but in reality it's much, much more. This letter addresses a Hollywood that's no longer recognizable, and that melancholy is woven into the fabric of this film. While there is the requisite violence, witty banter, and unpredictable outcomes, this is probably the most mature and intelligent Quentin Tarantino film yet. It also deviates from the Tarantino template by remaining somewhat linear. With a runtime of just over two hours and forty minutes, the pacing is artfully throttled, allowing the audience to take in the authentic and painstakingly detailed scenery. The period music drives the narrative but never becomes a music video. The performances are flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt will deservedly receive accolades for their performances as the main characters, but honestly there is not a single weak performance among the ensemble. And lastly, the subject matter: I was admittedly apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. While no one would be surprised to see these heinous acts glorified or even caricatured, Tarantino continues to be unpredictable. At the risk of spoiling the plotline, I'll just say this is handled tastefully and even respectfully, yet true to the classic Tarantino flair.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood demonstrates a more mellowed Quentin Tarantino touch but it's far from a departure. I suspect audiences that normally can't stomach the assaulting violence and shock of the Tarantino brand may very well enjoy this film.", "Ummm....": "I have watched most of Tarantino's movies. I respect his style of storytelling and consider him a talent. In my humble opinion I thought this one was just okay.", "This movie is perfect": "This movie is amazing; I dont even know what else to say. This is a must watch!", "Wow and Wow!": "I have not seen such a fantastic movie as this in a long time! The ending - wow the best!!!!!!", "What a perfect movie": "Just home from a movie night out at the cinema. This is just a perfect movie that entertained us very much! Everything was just perfect. Sometimes funny, sometimes thriller, little horror even, sometimes western, sometimes police,... They got a lot of movie genres wrapped in different scenes throughout the movie as I take that as an ode to the movie business all together. Most likely this movie is filled with references that I didn't even see or know. Everything is just so well done in each scene. What a perfect movie.", "You MUST see this. It's 241 min of romance tempered by tough nostalgia.": "Twenty-five years after Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino is still getting our attention. Today in Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood he takes a calmer, less sardonic view of the passage of cultural time from The Graduate, Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy, and other great '60's classics and the future '70's greats like Taxi Driver, Star Wars, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The Hollywood mojo was impressive in those decades, and he loves it all.By focusing on almost has-been TV star Rick (Leo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt), writer/director Tarantino can be wistful about a Hollywood that has reached its peak in the 60's and hard-nosed about the wars like Vietnam and murders like Manson's to temper the almost giddy love of movies divorced from reality. Never is he sappy or sarcastic, just mindful throughout of the passage of time and innocence.In the 2 hrs 41 min, however, he doesn't cut scenes when he should such as the re-creation of old TV show segments just too long and dull to be anything but slow. However, when the two stars are together the magic of old Hollywood is present, even if they can't compete with Newman and Redford.Never one to rely just on meticulous re-creation of an era (his details are marvelous), Tarantino plays with the lost innocence motif, even with war raging on TV and producers assassinating the careers of stars. Still, this is a milder, gentler Tarantino, unlike Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, for instance. As a loving take on violence and loss, he allows himself to honor the movies, from when he was a nerdy, video geek to a formidable auteur.See this romantic rendition of the sixties by arguably one of the best artists in the world. At the least it's entertaining, at the best it blends our benign nostalgia with the evanescence of fame, beauty, and peace.", "A true epic in 2019": "This is a refreshing film that is not based on pre established material(sequel, reboot etc). In 2019 that is a needle in a haystack. Just go in expecting a hang out movie and you will surely enjoy the ride. Honestly I have no quoms, this has all the components to make a great movie and it delivers in strides.", "Meh": "It's definitely not a bad movie and you will get your money's worth. but it's literally a \"meh\" not up to the hype or Quinton Tarantino's other movies. final impression. Meh", "Boring": "Boring as heck !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3 hours of pain. No plot at all.", "Enjoy the sights & sounds of 1969 Hollywood": "First time I saw this movie in cinema & wasn't sure how I felt. I liked it but needed to see again. Watched again last night in the comfort of my couch, in my lounge room on my home theatre system.\nSecond time around I \"got it\"\nThe story of Rick Dalton, Cliff Booth & to a lesser extent Sharon Tate are more of a sub plot. And I'm fine with this. The star of the movie is Hollywood & LA in 1969. Tarantino did a brilliant job with fantastic attention to detail in recreating the place in that period. The cinematography, the sights, sounds (cars, radio, tv, advertising posters, magazines, billboards) & the feel is just amazing. Watching this film is like tagging along with Rick Dalton & Cliff Booth jumping into the back seat of a classic car & being driven around Hollywood in that era. It's like being a fly on the wall in a 60's movie studio or being an invisible person following a day in the life of Sharon Tate.\nThe movie builds up to the famous night of the Charles Manson family murders of Sharon Tate & friends & subverts expectations in a way only Tarantino can pull off.The dialogue is very Tarantino & the acting & chemistry of DiCaprio & Pitt is perfect!Enjoy the movie for what it is - a tour of Hollywood in 1969.", "Tarantino's Masterpiece": "This film is Tarantino's masterpiece. Not Pulp Fiction, not Reservoir Dogs, but his newest movie. The story deals with a once popular, but now struggling, fictional actor named Rick Dalton and his best friend/stunt double, Cliff Booth. That may not sound like a very interesting plot (which it isn't) but the way it unfolds is so beautiful with Rick accepting his new role in Hollywood and in his life in general. This film is about Rick coming to terms with himself as a person and as an actor, which is something everyone has to face in their life. The way the setting is portrayed is incredible as well. I was never alive to experience the 60s but after watching this movie I feel like I really was in 1969 LA. The soundtrack also adds to this atmosphere. Both the soundtrack and setting also add to the themes of the movie since this is a decade most people reminisce about. One of my favorite Tarantino story niches is also used again in this film with the positive rewriting of negative history (such as in Inglorious Basterds in an example of his previous films). This has become one of my favorite movies of all time. It took me a few watches for it to really sink in, so I highly recommend that if you are a Tarantino fan and did not like this movie on the first viewing that you go back and watch it again.", "Cool movie": "This movie has it all. Its definitely a solid 8 out of 10 and Brad Pitt and Leo's acting was on point.", "GREAT GREAT FLICK": "To date this is QT's best effort and BP\"s best role. TEN STARS", "This is worst of the year, not Cats.": "At least Cats tried for humor, they tried for songs, and yeah, they had a shotty plot, but a plot. The comparison is only here because it was called the worst of the year. No. THIS is the worst. This is boring as hell. You thought Cats had no plot? Meet your match. And here, Nobody is likable. Nobody feels. Nobody loves. A bunch of vapid, random people without any intriguing backstory are just doing nothing. Oh look, that guy's supposed to be Bruce Lee (who would never, ever behave like that btw). Oh, he's gone. If they sang songs about themselves and were retouched with weird CGI fur, that would've been an improvement. Every hour or so you get a stupid voiceover narration that's as useful as using Elmer's glue to lay bricks for a house. But shove Pitt, Pacino, DiCaprio and of course Tarantino together and give them whatever run time they want to string together a bunch of subplots, and we nominate them. Oh yeah, I think maybe Charles Manson was there for a hot sec for no reason and Margot Robbie was.. a woman pretending to be...Sharon Tate? Was Sharon Tate? When she \"sees\" herself in a movie, it's not even her. I get what he was going for at the end, and how the title connects. I get it. But maybe if we were actually watching a movie leading up to that and not just thrown in, it would have gelled. This script was like if an intern who was totally over their job accidentally stapled every script in the slush pile together and left it on Tarantino's desk by accident, and Tarantino, while on 100 drugs, thought, \"Brilliant.\" Singing \"Jellicle, jellicle, jellicle, cats Jelllicle ball, jellicle moon\" made more freaking sense.", "Quentino Tarantin": "Another big and great film you dont want to lose. Art movie. This is a true masterpiece. Not that kind of movie you will see very relaxed eating popcorn and drinking soda, you dont have time to do that. You will see every milisecond and looks like the movie absorb you too keep watching it. Very glad too see!", "They don't make em like they used to": "For years now Hollywood's biggest obsession has been pushing technology and replacing story narratives with CGI beams in the sky. Tarantino takes us back to a different time, one where actors and story carried the film and boy does this one nail those better than any I've seen in a long time. If you're a fan of great storytelling and a journey this era simply denies to offer go see this movie! Laugh and sit in awe of someone who cares about the subject matter and remember what it feels like to love a movie again!", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood...Quentin Tarantino made a movie.": "ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD just might be the best film ever about the making of movies, and the creative people who make them happen, and this is because director Quinton Tarantino's love film making, and those very people, suffuse every single frame of his latest film. His recreation of 1969 Hollywood will surely rank as one of his finest achievements, and this film, will likely not be considered his greatest (for me that honor still belongs to RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION), but I have a feeling that ONCE UPON A TIME... just might become his most beloved film. It is something of a departure for Tarantino, as the tone is far removed from his more recent violent action movies like KILL BILL, and INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, and many have compared it to JACKIE BROWN. There plenty of great dialogue, most of it so funny that it could easily be classified as a comedy, but verbosity of THE HATEFUL EIGHT is missing here, in fact, there is not one of Tarantino's \"big speechs\" by any character. This movie is truly character driven, seemingly dependent on great stand alone moments and sequences, especially in the first act, but I thought the plot threads flowed together nicely at the end, even if it did come after a time jump and a lot of narration that would have felt clunky in the hands of a lesser director. At two hours and forty minutes, some will call this movie \"slow\" and \"rambling,\" which implies that it is dull, which can't be further from the truth.And if this movie is character driven, then Tarantino hands the steering wheel to two of his finest creations: Rick Dalton, a fading star, whose main claim to fame was being the lead in a TV western of the 50's and early 60's, and his stunt double, and all around best friend, Cliff Booth, who has been with Rick since his days as a big star. Rick is insecure and fearful, as the TV western is now past its prime, and a changing culture has left actors like him utterly adrift; his career has been reduced to guest starring spots as villains on other network shows. Rick could easily be a stand in for Robert Horton, Robert Fuller, Will Hutchins, Nick Adams, Edd Byrnes, or any other B/W ghost from MeTV. Cliff, on the other hand, is a solid rock, capable of dealing with any challenge or problem, from getting Rick to the set on time, to getting on the roof and fixing Rick's TV antenna. But there is some darkness in Cliff's past, and it is quickly apparent that he can be quite violent if the situation requires it - a point that will become important by the end of the movie. And in Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, Tarantino found his perfect Rick and Cliff, as both actors do career best work here. Their scenes together are the very definition of \"chemistry\" as they play so well off one another.The other story, concurrent to Rick and Cliff's, is that of Sharon Tate, the real life actress who was the wife of Roman Polanski, and the most famous victim of Charles Manson's murder cult. Tarantino arranges for her to live right next door to Rick Dalton, another fact that will become pertinent in the finale. Margot Robbie is awesomely beautiful in the part, and I must say that I think Tarantino is tremendously respectful to her here.As I said, ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD does not have the violent swagger of Tarantino's recent films, and at the twenty minute mark, as was a little worried that he might have taken too deep a dive into Hollywood of the past, giving us a film that was just a meander through nostalgia, but once I adjusted to the specific rhythm of this film, which tells its story through some great sequences, and character interactions, all was well. There are so many scenes that I instantly fell in love with: Cliff's encounter with a wonderfully cocky Bruce Lee (wonderfully played by Mike Moh); the swinging party at the Playboy mansion (where Damian Lewis not so much as plays Steve McQueen as suggests him); Rick having his faith in himself restored by a child actress on the set the Lancer pilot; Rick singing \"Behind the Green Door\" on Hullabaloo; Sharon Tate sitting in a movie theater and watching the audience react to her on the screen in the Dean Martin film, THE WRECKING CREW; Cliff's visit to the Spahn Ranch and his encounter with Manson's \"family,\" a scene filled with palpable dread. Then there is the finale, where Tarantino takes a page of his own from INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, and rewrites history. The finale did put a smile on my face, as I truly loved seeing some of the worst human beings who ever lived getting exactly what they deserved, and having this fairy tale come to a happy ending.The Hollywood of 1969 is as much a character in this film as any actor, from the cigarette smoke in the bars, the Hippies on the street corners, Neil Diamond on the FM radio (another great soundtrack), old Chevy pickups on the highways, the sideburns and miniskirts, the movie posters for Italian westerns, to the overwhelming sense of a time and place in transition, with the past slipping away fast, and an unknown future rushing in head long. That was the year of the Moon landing and Chappaquiddick, of Woodstock and Manson, as the 60's ended strong, and not for the last time would Americans look around and say, \"How did we get here?\"And what a cast Tarantino has assembled, besides his leads, there is Al Pacino (as an agent who gets Rick a job in Italy), Kurt Russell, Emile Hirsch (as Jay Sebring), old timers Bruce Dern and Clu Gulager, Clifton Collins, Lena Dunham, Austin Butler, Margeret Qually, Dakota Fanning (the last four playing members of Manson's family), Rebecca Gayheart, Luke Perry and Timothy Olyphant as Rick's costars on Lancer, Michael Madsen, Brenda Vacarro, Scoot McNairy, Nicholas Hammond (as Sam Wanamaker), Marting Kove and James Remar. Thankfully, Tarantino did not give himself a cameo, and stayed behind the camera. And I am also thankful that Tarantino did not give much screen time to Charles Manson himself, an individual who got way too much attention when he was alive. There was also enough name dropping of now obscure 60's Hollywood figures that Millennials will be busy for a week looking them up on their I-Phones (my favorite was the shout out to Sergio Corbucci).Finally, I am most disappointed that I can't go on Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, or Youtube and watch \"Nebraska Jim\" or \"The 14 Fists of McCluskey.\"", "This film will certainly divide audiences": "Another great Tarantino film, though I do agree there are times where it feels a little indulgent and meandering. The climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. There isn't really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but Tarantino's sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films I've seen in a while.", "Tarantino's latest film is his most laid-back, comical and impactful, although it's sure to divide lots of moviegoers.": "Once Upon a TIme... in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, which stars DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie as actors during 60s Hollywood. This film tells the story of Rick Dalton, an actor who realizes that he needs to change in order to become successful in 1960s Hollywood. The plot also involves Dalton's partner Leo, the Manson Family and Sharon Tate.The original trailer for this movie presents a lot of what I needed to know about the movie, the movie would be laid-back, and a lot different from his other works. I came out with exactly this. This movie is much more lighthearted than most of his works, as the violence and gore is very minimal. The movie intends to explore the life of a dying actor and his rerise to fame. It also presents some other plots which explore other figures the movie presents such as Leo's relation with the Manson family, as well as the life of Sharon Tate. Tarantino's take on 60s Hollywood is a very interesting one, that utilizes elements of comedy, as well as elements of 60s filmmaking. The way all of these plots come together during the third act is sure to divide audiences. I don't want to get into spilers, so all I can really say is that's it's an ending that'll either make or break the film for you. Personally, I found it very satisfying to see the final outcome, and I really like that he twists things up by the end.My only problem is that I wish they gave more character to Sharon Tate. We don't really see her very often throughout the film, and from the little that we do see of her, we don't really learn anything new about her. She gives off the idea that she has a shallow personality, which I doubt was true in reality.I had a great time seeing this movie, although I feel like it'll appeal more to fans of Tarantino's work overall. It's laid-back, surprising, comedic and ha its own stylistic touches that are unique for a Tarantino film.9/10", "Kick Back, Relax, and Soak in the Splendor of Tarantino's Hollywood": "Of the handful of elite directors still working today (a number that has dwindled in the past two decades), Quentin Tarantino is the undisputed leader in \"cool\". He makes movies that sync to the movie geek's unexplored subconscious. Movies that can be both literate and silly, and can harmonize these opposing ideas into pristine cinematic art. Tarantino is a director who can make a woman's hanging feel poignant, or a monologue about Superman feel positively riveting. He specializes in creating the cinematic equivalents of adrenaline shots to the heart. His newest film, Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood, is not that type of \"cool\". It's not the thrilling, electro-charged, go-for-broke mad genius mayhem of Tarantino's best movies, but rather something quieter, more laid back, groovier.Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood doesn't necessarily have a plot. At least not the kind that moves linearly from beginning to end. The story roams around the events, people, and places involved in the Manson Family Murders of 1969, but we are privy to only glances. Our protagonists are aging leading man Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double and friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). It's hard to describe these characters' story in movie terms. The film follows them, but not through a journey or a mystery or a caper, but through their everyday life. Rick on the set of a western TV show, Cliff fixing a TV antenna while reminiscing about the time he challenged Bruce Lee to a fight. In actuality, the movie is almost entirely made up of such scenes. Interesting vignettes of Hollywood life.In the moment, these don't seem to have a purpose. I can imagine a lot of people (Tarantino fans included) thinking to themselves around the middle of the film, \"What's the point here?\". The thought never crossed my mind though because I was too busy admiring the craft. For starters, we have a trio of brilliant performances from three of our greatest modern movie stars. DiCaprio and Pitt, neither of whom I find to have upper echelon acting talent, are given roles that play directly to the strengths they do possess. DiCaprio has room to go way over the top playing an actor who is trying to literally act his way out of irrelevance. He has always had a tendency to overact, but it works for this character. The same goes for Pitt, who too often underacts. He is gifted here with a character whose steely, tough guy personality fits him like a glove. Pitt settles into a comfortable groove with Cliff, centered and in control at all times, while adding an unexpected warmth not often seen from this type of character or Pitt himself. It's his best performance in years. The third great performance comes from Margot Robbie, an emerging classic Hollywood starlet playing a classic Hollywood starlet who was robbed of her chance to emerge. Robbie in a small, but vital role, radiates with innocent charm. Her function in the film is as a monument to a lost time, place, and feeling. Her performance has to be bigger than reality. It is just that; an idolized tribute to aspiring actresses, and to a larger extent, the good vibes of the 60s.The other thing keeping the vignettes fresh is Tarantino's direction. He's always been a limber, creative filmmaker, not afraid to surprise the audience with something utterly unexpected. He plays with time, narration, and story structure with giddy enthusiasm and a straight face. This manifests itself in Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood through his delightfully stubborn insistence on letting entire scenes play out. We've been conditioned to expect a certain pace in our films. We expect to get the desired information, and move on. Trim the fat. This film is plenty fat. We don't get a glimpse of Rick Dalton's TV work. We get a full recreation of a 'Rifleman'-style shootout. We don't get one shot of Booth driving a Coupe Deville across the Sunset Strip, we get long, almost action-set-piece-y montages. Indulgent, yes, but endlessly watchable.Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood is among the least \"exciting\" of Tarantino's work. It doesn't have the wild supercharged energy of Kill Bill or the thrilling character dynamics of The Hateful Eight, but that doesn't make it less of a film. And it's not to undersell this film's ending in which we are accosted by an explosion of violence so insane you can't help but cackle with glee. It's fifteen minutes of wacko brilliance. But for the most part, Tarantino's 9th picture is a mellow affair. A refreshing and wonderful elegy to a lost time. It's a collection of some of the best acted and directed scenes of the past five years. A much needed gift to those of us who still treasure good old-fashioned grown-up entertainment, with plenty to savor afterwards.91/100", "One of the best movies of the year": "This is a love letter for the vintage hollywood movies, we can see a different quentin tarantino movie, without hard violence or hard scenes but this movie still working with all the stories that we can see, and the good performances and the good production make this movie a one of the best films of the year.", "Boring Boring Boring": "His worst film, ever.No plot.

Tarantino has really shined the spotlight on where Hollywood has lost it's way...'Once Upon a Time' a star could walk into a theatre without fans clinging for selfies, developing the film from your camera was enough to acknowledge you did indeed meet a person. There is the classic Tarantino focus on feet and footwear (something we have come to enjoy and actually watch for) and clever editing that leave you to question what you just watched (cowboy hat during conversation / scarf in car). Great acting by all involved - thought provoking - Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is so much more than the storyline/script...it is detail on film at it's best. Encourages you to review and think 'what if?'", "great film on legacy and self worth": "Excellent cast - Was a bit slow at some parts - Great ending that tied everything together - Good periodical film with tons of nostalgia", "Why films like these are crucial.": "A good chunk of modern audiences will probably struggle to like or grasp this film. It requires patience and an understanding of world-building while simultaneously getting to know who these characters are exactly. Once all is said and done, the payoff is well worth it. There are scenes which could have been cut down on, and other characters who needed more screentime to fully round out this grand finale of major Tarantino proportions. This film would probably sit better with audiences in the 90's or early 2000's. Not this 2019 Disney monopoly of movies made for those with short-attention spans and a yearning for 'member-berries' i.e. showing up to these live-action rehash movies as of late. There's an underlying sad truth of what this abysmal (for filmmaking) Marvel era has done to people's expectations, and this has been made evident from reviews not only on this film but others too. One review in particular had the gall to compare Quentin and his choices to Guardians of the Galaxy... In contrast, auteurs like Tarantino shouldn't even be on the same plane of existence. Studios like Disney are killing cinema and mass audiences are allowing it to happen. All in all, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a testament for those who wish to avoid seeing the art in cinema die out.", "The Name is Accurate": "This film is literally about a fairy tale that happens Once Upon a Time and just so happens to be in Hollywood. Do not look for real life truth as with any of his films, which is hard to do since real people are characters mixed into Tarantino's bag of Pulp Fiction. Remember that it is about the interactions, they, in totality, reveal the story he is telling. Redemption lives within the walls of an accumulation of mundane tasks, but in this case those tasks are the glamour of a fading lead actor trying to get through what to common people is a mid life crisis. This movie is about everyday themes within a construct of trivial pursuits. But on the flip side they aren't trivial to Rick or Cliff. Does Dalton's comeback even matter while people from the Ranch are preying on the same ideals of perceived vanity? Is it vanity or just being a human no matter what your career is? The fabric of this film is woven by all the ingredients Quentin likes to brew, but from angles you didn't know you wanted to see. It is a long epic with scenes that make you wonder about their significance when they are really just nostalgic placemats upon which the dinner will be served. But he takes his time making it. The reveal and end are not shock value based, but they are shockingly refreshing. Don't over expect, don't overthink, just let it speak and be open to hearing what it has to say. If you do, you'll love it.", "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood by Quentin Tarantino": "Stories about Hollywood would immediately capture the audience attention, to see how the main characters succeed to get a career and become big stars once they arrive in Hollywood. These stories would be usually explored, in the books, comic books, television series and movies. Some of these stories can be fiction one, by either set in nowadays or in the past by trying to be as detailed as possible, about how the filmmaking environment look like. Other stories can be based on real events, to see how some of the big stars succeeded in their careers or even failed and tried to move forward with more or less difficulties. These stories can be told in the funniest way, by using the humor to be workable in the narration's rhythm. Other stories can be told in the dramatic way, by using the emotions of the main characters, to let the audience feel their strong emotions when they face their difficulties. Or these stories can even use both elements for a musical, by balancing the humor and the drama when the main characters express their emotions through the musical notes. The filmmaker Quentin Tarantino seems interested to tell a story about Hollywood in the Golden Age of 1969, by making references about some of the most important actors in the television series. As well as exploring some historical references by giving some changes, in the fictional way with unexpected surprising moments. By making this movie, Quentin Tarantino works with some important actors again, like Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, who both already worked with him. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood by Quentin Tarantino with Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie. The movie's plot: In Hollywood's Golden Age of 1969, the television actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who both were in once popular stars for an old notorious television series. Until they are striving to achieve fame and success, in Hollywood film industry, where some changes happened as they both have difficulties to recognize it. The movie would immediately capture the audience attention, from the beginning to the end, to see how the main characters are going to take important decisions for their career. The story uses specific details about the look of Hollywood's Golden Age, by making the movie interesting about which dresses did people wear, what kind of cars did they drive, how the old televisions did look like, what kind of songs were often listened and so on. The screenplay was elaborated by making the narration's rhythm intriguing, as well as the editing helped to elaborate the movie's narration dynamic. Through the story's narration the camera captures some important scenes, by making them unforgettable in every single camera's angle shots and its movements. The movie gets interesting when the camera shots sequences, where the main characters perform in the projects they are acting for. Especially to see how Rick Dalton moves forward with the shooting, to even repeat some takes whenever is necessary. Leonardo DiCaprio was extraordinary as Rick Dalton, an aging television actor who sees the changes happening in Hollywood. As Rick searches which projects to pickup, by then trying to achieve the fame he needs for. Brad Pitt was excellent as Cliff Booth, a stunt double who would do anything to be involved in the projects which Rick is in. But in the same way, Cliff would never let be underestimated or even get irritated by anybody, as he always wins in the fights in the most unexpected ways. Margot Robbie did a well done job as Sharon Tate, a popular actress of Hollywood who is also the neighbor of Rick Dalton. The movie entertains the audience with humor, which uses a workable rhythm in the most surprising moments without forcing it. Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is one of the greatest masterpieces of all time, also one of the best Quentin Tarantino's movies.", "Well spent 2.5 hours": "Nice story, a little bit slow but I'm fine with that. I would recomend it to everyone, masterpiece by Brand Pitt and Dicaprio.", "BEST TARANTINO FILM EVER.": "Go to an early showing, its a 3 hour film. And WORTH EVERY SINGLE SECOND. But, you want to be awake and alert because it it slow going at the beginning and then it slowly builds over time to one of the best most satisfying movie endings i have ever seen. Go early, pay attention, enjoy the ride.", "One of the best movies that Tarantino had ever done.": "To tell you the truth, this is one of the films I most expected this year and being honest I was not disappointed, when I left the cinema, I left very satisfied. The movie tells you two stories at the same time, a fictional one by Rick and Cliff and another true one that would be Sharon Tate's, the movie plays with you teaching you how sweet and kind Sharon Tate is, making you believe that at the end of the movie she will be brutally murdered as in real life, but as we know it was not so, as in Inglorious Basterds, Tarantino changes the timeline, causing an event that never happened. Many people say that the movie could have been the same without the scenes of Sharon Tate and the truth is not true, since those scenes are what gives an excellent touch to the final scene in which Rick after saving his neighbor Unintentionally, he finally knows her in person, without those scenes the end would not have been so special. The film gives more importance to the characters than the plot, which is fine, because they are very good characters, since they have a well-developed personality, which makes them interesting, what I mean is that the movie is taken for the characters, therefore they make the plot more and more interesting, and in my opinion Cliff steals the movie, without a doubt he is one of the best characters that Tarantino has created. That apart from the fact that the environment of the film is very striking, this film is undoubtedly the most personal movie of Tarantino, it is like a love letter towards the cinema that he likes so much, the only thing I have to complain about It would be something like if there is an occasional filler scene and that the movie does not stop to explain why the killers of the end were there, well those who know the real story, understand why they are there, but those who do not know the story Real may feel somewhat confused, that is why I consider that the film can not have a 10/10. In conclusion Once upon a time in Hollywood it is for me the best movie of 2019, it is the movie that anyone tired of watching marvel in the cinema would like, with very well developed characters, an attractive environment, great performances, and that is why I consider this movie a very good 9/10.", "provocative": "Each film by Quentin Tarantino is provocative. But in this case, the test is more tough because the first large part of the movie has high chances to be boring or so far by what you expect. But this is its fundamental virtue / a galery of portraits, nice, realistics, eccentrics , proposing not only a hommage to old Hollywood but reflection about cinema . The portrait of Sharon Tate is one of the precious gifts of the film. The admirable work and fine collaboration between Brad Pitt and Leonardo di Caprio is other. Sure, in the last part, what you expect, you have. But the film remains special in so many senses, than it deserves to not be ignored , giving explanation to the essence of the cinematography,at the level of influences and fascinations of Tarantino. That does it provocative in real sense.", "At least the dog had some fun": "Tarantino proofs once more to be one of the most overrated directors of our time, here we have a waisted cast of actors : Pitt boring himself to tears, DiCaprio painfully overacting, ( at least funny sometimes). And Margot Robbie just being blond, watching her own movies, anything else? Ah, yes, Al Pacino, one of the greatest American actors of all time being wasted in an unimportant minor role. No, It's just not enough to show myself ( and the world): I am so cool I don't need to care about a story. There is no focus, no timing, no story-line at all. What's it all about for more than two hours? The only sequence that works is the final one, exploding violence in the most grotesque way you can imagine, at least we are familiar with that.\nAnd by the way: rewriting history? Didn't Tarantino use this trick for a finale in Inglourious Basterds before, but more convincing there? 4 stars for set design and camera work., because I am generous.", "A Masterpiece!": "If you believe in quantum physics, string theory and the notion of infinite universes, then somewhere there is a universe where Quentin Tarantino gets to write our collective history. That's the universe where I want to live.This film is the work of a master filmmaker, the Sharon Tate scenes that set up the plot are gut wrenching and perfectly realized by Margot Robbie, she's beautiful yet human, perfect. The lead actors are exact in their choices, the script is surprisingly excellent, bridging space between documentary truth and narrative brilliance.A love letter to old LA, as observed by a native. And finally, not a single use of the N word, the biggest flaw in some of his recent work IMHO.His best film, maybe ever.", "Once upon a time in Hollywood is Definitely One Of Those Films That You Go To Movie Theaters To Have a Super Groovy Good Time.": "Master Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino is Back And Boy Oh!

Every Tarantino movie lives in such a heightened and complex world and this is maybe the densest picture of all. Some viewers may be surprised that this films pacing and tone differ from other Tarantino pieces but this is only a testament to how talented he is.", "My favorite movie of 2019 and my 5th favorite of all time": "Pitt and Leo were awesome together in this movie. At times it was slow, yes, but the ending was well worth the wait. For those of you that don't know, this is a \"spoof\" of sorts on the horrific Charles Manson cult murders in the late 60's. My family didn't know that going in and they were quite confused throughout the movie as to where it was leading to until the end.", "Wow, this is a great movie!": "This movie was remarkable. The acting by Brad Pitt and Leo DeCaprio was very good. It was 161 minutes long and flowed through to a superb ending. I am now rewinding to watch it again. It was very nostalgic, especially the Heaven Scent perfume commercial on the radio in Cliff's yellow Caddy. Also the music was prime, especially The Rolling Stones near the end. 10 out of 10 for me! Hope it wins an Oscar for Best Picture.", "Outstanding": "What a outstanding film, it's for everyone who admire cinematography in the late 60s", "One of the greatest film plot twist ever": "For more than 2 hours i kept asking myself: what the heck is this movie about and when will the murders begin? I mean i loved every second of it, but in the back of my mind there was a countdown, \"one more hour of the film and nothing led us to the Tate killings yet, what's going on here, will we be disappointed?!\" And then... BOOM, the whole idea of the film, the stunning twist, dawned on me. And i was in tears and was fascinated because i realized QT had played with us, frustrated us, made us wait and wait and wait... and then gave us mooore than we had expected. I was even afraid the twist i had realized might not be true, which would have been a major letdown. But no, QT didn't let us down, he delivered and we thank him for that. Although i suspect people who hated the movie didn't know what happened back then in 1969 so the film really didn't make sense for them. But guys... It makes sense, you just didn't get it. It's not the same thing if you didn't know what happened back then, but at least google \"sharon tate murder\" now and maybe you'll be amazed", "A rich fictional story, about a very real Moment In Time, as only Tarantino could tell it": "Quentin Tarantino has an unmistakable, impeccable style. His writing, his direction, his stupendous production design and visuals, his reliably impressive and huge ensemble casts, his memorable music selections - everything the man does screams a love of movies, and of film-making, from high-minded art films to schlocky B-flicks. Even though not all his pictures come away with equal success, there's no denying that Tarantino is a master of the medium, from effusive pop culture nods and snappy dialogue to intense action violence and gritty characters and narratives. 'Once upon a time... in Hollywood' might actually be the most Tarantino that Tarantino has ever allowed himself to be, and it's no mistake that the title is awash in insider film industry references and Hollywood history. Wrap all this up in the palpable look and feel of a by-gone era, and what we have on our hands is a movie that from the very, very start comes across as an instant classic.Tarantino's approach to making movies is equal parts skill, self-indulgence, and absolute passion. That spirit is shared, or at least very effectively communicated in kind, by his collaborators behind the scenes and his stars in front of the camera. The result, here above all, is a picture that feels like it's been made as much for the sheer abundant joy of it as for any intent to tell a story. Thusly are we treated to outstanding contributions from everyone involved: superb if not flawless cinematography, shot composition, editing, costume design, hair and makeup work, production design, art direction, lighting, sound design, filming locations, music, effects, stunts, choreography. 'Once upon a time... in Hollywood' is nothing if not a scrumptious feast for the eyes and ears. The dialogue and character writing is so rich that no matter how small an actor's part, they all shine in the time they're given and make their mark, and a central narrative is hardly even necessary.To that point, there are concrete plot threads here, and the fictional story is woven around a landmark period - a singular moment even - in American culture. As the runtime progresses and approaches the halfway mark at about 90 minutes, those threads circle more and more closely around the Manson Family, and tension rises for the viewer as the climax approaches. Even at that, however, to no small extent a lot of the picture comes off more like a patchwork quilt whose adjoining squares gradually piece together the whole. This feeling is enhanced not just by the sheer number of characters and plot threads, but also Tarantino's penchant for extended cutaways to provide further details about his fictional figures. Through it all the story is wonderfully compelling, no matter how loose it may be at times. Through it all we're treated to Tarantino trademarks including and not limited to loving tracking shots, and persistent looks at feet. Through it all, the entire cast is fantastic.And what a cast! The credits are a veritable who's who of Hollywood luminaries past and present. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are solid leads, naturally, but it's the names and faces that round out less prominent roles that steal the show. Margot Robbie positively glows as Sharon Tate, and Dakota Fanning has come a very long way from the child actress we were all first introduced to. Appearing in only two scenes, then 10-year old Julia Butters arguably makes more of an impression than anyone else appearing here! And the list goes on; if only for a moment, it's a joy to see Maya Hawke, Harley Quinn Smith, Margaret Qualley, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Emile Hirsch, Zo\u00c3\u00ab Bell, Kurt Russell, and all the many others who grace our vision.The same revisionist fancy Tarantino exercised in 'Inglourious Basterds' is also in full-force here, yet the spark of imagination is gratifying in a unique way, and leads to a climax that's fabulously thrilling. As ever, an incredible soundtrack was put together that brilliantly complements the nostalgic atmosphere and the feeling of each scene, and that's true not least of all at the climax. There's astonishing depth in the characters, and in every detail of the world Tarantino creates, that a \"mere\" three-hour movie only begins to scrape the surface of. In every way I can think to describe 'Once upon a time... in Hollywood' is altogether exceptional, exhibiting the tremendous capabilities of Tarantino as writer, director, and visionary, and each and every person in the cast and crew. I hesitate to say it's completely perfect, as something about the whole feels almost imperceptibly \"off\" in a way I can't quite place my finger on. Yet every conceivable meaningful criticism can scarcely make a scratch in the lush sheen the title boasts, and the film we get is delightfully entertaining, absorbing, and satisfying. For the length alone, and as a matter of personal preference, this won't be for everyone, but as far as I'm concerned 'Once upon a time... in Hollywood' is a movie that all but demands viewership. Recommended above all for ardent cinephiles, these three hours are worth it.", "I'm the Devil. And I'm here to do the Devil's business.": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood isn't bad, it's just not really much of a film.So many A list actors in random unconnected events, that even that starts to become amusing. The crazy home invasion at the end is entertaining, but doesn't tie it all together or give anything meaning. Some good stuff in here, gimme some sort of plot though, as each scene isn't memorable like many of Tarantino's other films. I don't care for Margot Robbie and have no idea what the point of this character is. Andie MacDowell's daughter Margaret Qualley's indeed alluring, I'm sure she will get plenty of quality roles to come. Brad Pitt's consistently good in it, DiCaprio on and off.", "Great actors getting the rightful send off? Boy was I wrong. The Story of Hollywood's Actors' lives in 1969, with a twist.": "I didn't know this movie was about something so wrong. My reaction is the real deal to realizing what it was actually about. I know a lot about what the movie was about but didn't even think of that until the final 25 minutes. I completely decided to not read on descriptions or anything on this movie as just by seeing the actors involved made me excited to watch this movie.I came into it without knowing what was about to happen.. Normally that is never the case.I started watching the movie and I believed it be a story about to good friends that love totally opposite lives and that they worked together on a daily basis. This was true. I expected crazy parties and fun events. We got a bit of that.We also got to witness a very well portrayed Bruce Lee vs a big southern, stunt double. That scene was marvelous and comedic. I would pay again to watch that scene alone. Bruce Lee is hyping up the actors and the set but Brad Pitt can't help but laugh... what happens next is spectacular.We witnesses Leonardo DiCaprio in raw form acting on a western set and needing to \"rehype\" himself to give a better performance. In those scenes alone, the Movie within the movie made the actual movie seem less interesting because the acting in the movie, within the movie was done so well. I felt I was in that western movie. I wanted to see more of the MOVIE within the movie! Maybe we will get that one day because Leo did a great job as the actor in the movie within the movie.Brad does his own thing while Leo acts, and during his time away runs into some unordinary people and ends up in a place that gives of \"kill bill\" vibes. When arriving, I couldn't help but think, Is Brad Pitt going to be involved in 1969 Western movie plot while Leonardo is ACTING an old, 1850s Western Movie plot? It was amazing. It almost left me speechless.\nWhen both scenes ended, I thought Brad Pitt's scene was just another \"day in the life\" of being Leo's stunt double. But oh boy was I wrong..Life goes on for both of them and it looks like the movie is just a SEND OFF of all these great actors.. Brad walking away in the spotlight with his dog and cigarette. Margot pregnant and sleeping in Hollywood. Leonardo Practicing his lines in pool.. You know, a perfect goodbye. Boy was I wrong!I will not spoil the movie. Just know that the 2.20 hours of film time is not the climax although there is almost 6 climax's in the movie. The grand climax is extra ordinary and touches on a sensitive subject and makes us feel so good about doing the right thing to the wrong people, very badly. \"Well deserved\" type of feeling. \"If that were to happen on my watch\" type feeling.In those final moments, I couldn't help but wonder, Is this really about to happen? This awful tragedy being portrayed by great actors and a genius director?Brad Pitt and Leonardo give justice to people that would want to hurt Hollywood's actors. What I mean by \"Justice\" is by doing the maximum amount of pain to rotten people with the tools you or any actor may have at their disposal whilst at home.I rate this movie a 10 because this was 3+ movies within another and it included a real tragedy with a an alternate look on what could have been a different life for Hollywood's best.Perfect story telling. Great humor. Great directing. Overall, a movie that is a rarity nowadays. This is art. A rewatchable movie. A classic.", "A Tarantino Film is like a Hanzo sword. It can only be compared to other Hanzo swords.": "Tarantino at his best, in rare form. Dicaprio and Pitt acted their faces off. Its funny smart and original in a world of remakes and comic book films. A true new Masterpiece.", "Redemption in a twisted sort of way": "SPOILER ALERT! Saw it twice. I needed to see it a second time without a knot in my stomach. I was a teenager during the Manson horror and it is fire branded in my memory bank. For almost three hours I dreaded the ending because I knew what was coming. But....hard to explain the redemption, false as it was, felt like a very bad debt was satisfied. Outside of the stellar ending, the movie was nostalgic and fun. Nothing more fun than old Hollywood. The reason I gave this a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the inconsistencies with time sensitive details. One very noticeable to me was that most of the cars were 10 to 15 years behind the time frame of the movie. Needed more Chargers, Chevelle Ss and Galaxies which were very popular then. Although I really enjoyed seeing the vintage 50's and 60's, it didn't quite fit. The movie was non stop entertainment with great character development, great soundtrack and great dialogue. LOVED the dog.", "Really glad this film didn't disappoint.": "I do understand the complaints that this film has been receiving and I do see the criticisms for this film. However, I have to say that despite all of that, I absolutely loved this film and I'm really glad to see that Quentin Tarantino was able to make another great film.As a fan of his movies, this movie has everything that I enjoy: you have the awesome dialogue, great and memorable characters, incredible cinematography and fantastic directing. Unlike his other films, this is not linear and there is a point at the second act where the plot deviates away from the main plot. However, just like his other films, Tarantino is able to make a film with great pacing despite that and I had a blast. There will be some people who will not have the same enthusiasm as I have as it may bore some people and just may lose interest toward the overall film because of it. Regarding the overall plot, I enjoyed watching the friendship between the two leads and just watching Rick Dalton, portrayed by Leonardo Di Caprio, just trying to put his name out there and still be relevant. One of the things that I have enjoyed was to see Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, portrayed by Brad Pitt, interact with real life characters of the time period and to see them be involved with this moment of Hollywood. It helped add personality and it allowed us to see some pretty nice and at times, funny moments with these characters.Surprisingly enough, this film doesn't have a lot of the overly violent scenes and I was overly surprised by the amount of dialogue and comedy that was implemented in this film. I laughed quite a bit and even enjoyed some of the in-jokes that he has about the movie industry and about some of the films from his filmography. Now, the violence is still there and when it hits, I think it was more impactful due to the fact that it was absent throughout the whole film. When it hits, it's shocking, surprising and funny at the same time. Definitely one of the very few times that I have reacted out loud in a movie theater.From the poster, people will know that Margot Robbie is in the film and she is playing Sharon Tate.. This is a small gripe that I do have toward the film. Sharon Tate is one of the major characters of the movie and I feel that she wasn't utilized in the film well enough. I have an idea toward why Tarantino wanted to focus onto her and in that concept, I think he did the best that he could to make her appearance in the film work. For some people, they may not get the idea and just find her appearance to be rather pointless and some may not find the focus on some of the recognizable faces of Hollywood at the time to be worth watching. Tarantino is making a love letter for that time period so unless you love movies or you enjoy Tarantino's style of humor, this may cause people to not be invested.Without a doubt, Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt were the best parts of the movie. They show why they are the best in Hollywood now and I just loved that they are playing actual characters. I tend to see them playing very serious roles and they are still good, but I missed when they were able to show their range of acting. I think they were able to do so here as Di Caprio was very funny and he brought a lot of personality to his character, along with Pitt. They both have great chemistry together and I've enjoyed every single moment they were onscreen.If some of the scenes were cut shorter and if some of the characters were more well written and used well, then I would have really have no gripes toward the film and would have put this on my top. This is a fun Tarantino film and I feel that fans will have a blast watching this film.", "A divot in the director's career": "It's not peak Tarantino, and that's the biggest flaw of this movie. Whole 'lotta nothing happens for more than two hours, leading to the kind of violent denouement that we'd expect from the auteur. In fact, if you didn't know Tarantino wrote and directed this, you would be none the wiser after watching the film. It's set in the fall of 1969, shortly before the infamous Tate-LaBianca murders in Hollywood, and it (mostly) follows the travails of a has-been TV actor named Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his longtime friend and stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Dalton used to be the star of a show called Bounty Law, a western in which his character is sort of an antihero, but the show ended its run when Dalton wanted to strike out for the presumably greener pastures of movies. Now he's kind of washed up, working as a guest star on current shows as the bad guy. Meanwhile, his buddy Cliff is sort of Rick's gopher, his own career derailed by his actions on the set of The Green Hornet. Completing the trio - although separately - is actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), wife of director Roman Polanski, who lives next door to Dalton in the Hollywood Hills. Much of the movie has to do with everyday life for these three in 1969 Hollywood, and there are a ton of movie references - sort of a Tarantino hallmark. But as Dalton, Booth, and Tate go about their lives, nothing really stands out as...well, interesting or full of any meaning for the audience. What probably was meant to be a lot of little scenes leading up to a fantastic conclusion was really a bunch of vignettes. The casting is as eclectic as we've come to expect from Quentin Tarantino, but the script doesn't really make use of anyone save for DiCaprio. Pitt and Robbie aren't given a lot to do other than look pretty, and talent like Al Pacino, Brenda Vaccaro, Damien Lewis, and Bruce Dern are paid very short shrift. The whole thing feels like imitation Tarantino and is definitely not among his best work. This is a dull movie, even with the \"revised history\" slant it tries to present.", "too long and needed more of a plot": "Not to much happens in this movie. It's about a washed up tv western star, Rick Dalton, and his sidekick, Cliff Booth, a stuntman. Cliff doesn't get much work any more, so his friend, Rick whom lost his driver's license, hire up to drive him around town. Rick gets a part to play a villain in a western movie. Meanwhile, Cliff gets into a beef with Bruce Lee, why? Rick lives next door to Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate. Cliff gives one of the Manson girl's a lift to the ranch and has a look around. Eventually Rick goes to Italy to be in shows over there. When he, his new wife, and Cliff return home in 6 months, it happens to be the night the Manson groupies plan on killing he residents of the Polanski house. But instead they break into Rick's house have a run in with Cliff and his dog. And Rick breaks out his flame thrower. A comic twist on what really happened.FINAL VERDICT: To long at over 2 1/2 hours, and like other Taratino movies, too many scenes that are just talk, Like Rick talking to the kid on the movie set. The dialogue is just too long. As well as the dialogue at the ranch. If you see it, split it up into 2 days.", "What was that?": "That was more random to me than Pulp Fiction.I don't know what the use of this movie is, but I'm really sure that this type of movies isn't mine. I could really use watching an action movie right now.", "Do not read the negative reviews!!": "OMG!! For all those who gave a low rating, have you ever written a screenplay? Are you an award winning movie director, writer, etc? I'm not. I am not a QT fan really. But the guy makes some good movies. So much negative reviews. Can anyone watch a movie today and just enjoy the movie? Unless your Steven Spielberg, QT, Coppola, Scorsese, E Banks. Keep your negative reviews to yourselves!! No one should care what you think about any movie.

We love all your movies. I am sure your novels will be great too but don't retire from films. Don't do that to your audience.I already watched it two times. Can go for another 10..12... 192372920 times", "One of the best films ever": "Before you watch this stunning masterpiece you should know all about Sharon Tate and the Manson family. Leo and Brad are amazing, both of their characthers are marvelous and if you're looking for a fast-action movie, go see the new fast and furious or endgame. This is a really slow movie, with a well-designed climax and a great ending. This is not Pulp Fiction or Inglorious Basterds is more like The Hateful Right but set in L.A 1969. Great picture but many people won't understand it. Most of the bad reviews found it boring, but if you understand cinema, it's a really REALLY good picture. P.S: A must have in Blu-Ray now that is coming soon", "What a great contribution to our amazing country": "Oh wow look at this. It's such a beautiful commodity, I mean it's a 2 HOUR FILM!!!!!!! OH MY GOD, that's just so AMAZING! I'm a hardworking Brit who works 15 hours a day and this film was a real treat, I usually haven't got time to watch a 2 hour film and this really made my otherwise boring life pretty amazing, it truly is amazing for ancient actors to come to life onscreen in a remarkable bit of technology. Thanks very much USA for making such a great contribution to the United Kingdom and being such a good Son of my sexy island.", "Wow": "I'm not a big DiCaprio fan , but in this movie he was just amazing. He settled into his role completely. Also the Rick Dalton character was an intense one. The reason i got the DVD to start with was because of the news I read about Bruce Lee's daughter speaking out in the media and seeing that Brad Pitt's character Cliff Booth faces off with Lee got me interested. Lee's daughter said that her dad was not like that - that he doesn't pick fights or irritate people which I understand to be true by what I've seen and read about him. But this is a FICTIONAL account. Tarantino wrote the story himself and seeing that Bruce Lee part of the movie, I thought, was humorous. DiCaprio made me laugh too. I like the characters (which were real people in their day), but fictional story. The guy that played Manson definitely looked the part and Dalton whipping out the flame thrower in the end was epic. If you can handle the constant F-bombs in the movie. You know, anything Tarantino does is going to have something gratuitous in it, and in this case, it's the language.", "Shows Tarantino's narcissism": "This movie is long and absolutely does not need to be, not much actually happens. Most of this movie could be cut out, the amount of feet is also weird and makes anybody but Tarantino uncomfortable. It seems like Tarantino made this movie for himself, not for the viewer, he has an obsession with old movies and wanted to make a movie about it and did quite a poor job with it. Directors cut out scenes that make the movie too long, Tarantino is so obsessed with himself at this point in his life he leaves everything in. I wanted to like this movie, I love Tarantino movies, but this one was just long and boring.", "I love you, Tarantino": "Thank you so much again for giving me what I needed. True to yourself and I'm so grateful! Enjoyed it thoroughly. Not sure why there was a nervousness lurking in my mind as to how it could be just a well known, tragic event recreation, which I, in fairness, wasn't looking forward to. I apologise for that worm of doubt. You didn't swerve off course and you depicted what all are hoping we could too. More, please...", "Watch to fall asleep": "The only thing I liked in the movie was the dog's acting.", "WOW TARANTINO SMASHES IT AGAIN ....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!": "Tarantino is my all time favourite director i love all his films and once again he has shown what a talent he is , this is up there with Pulp Fiction Inglorious Basterds and Django \" the D is silent \" unchained .... BRAVO mr T ..... 9/10", "The plot let the movie down! 4/10": "Review:\nAs this movie isn't based on true events, and none of the storylines actually lead to anything, I really couldn't see the point of this film. I have to commend the cinematography, costumes and props for portraying the period immaculately, and the terrific acting from Brad Pitt (Cliff Booth), and Leonardo DiCaprio (Rick Dalton) made the film watchable, but after sticking with the movie for so long, hoping that something would happen, I ended up feeling really disappointed. It's very rare that you see two A-List stars of this calibre joining forces, so I was expecting something special, especially after all of the award buzz surrounding it, but it turned out to be Hollywood love letter from Tarantino, which I didn't find that interesting. There are so many irrelevant scenes, and half of the characters, like Margot Robbie (Sharon Tate), Al Pacino (Marvin Schwartz) and Bruce Dern (George Spahn) were totally wasted. The saving grace of the whole film had to be the gruesome action scenes towards the end, but it was too little too late. When you usually spend nearly 3 hours watching a film, you hope to find a moral to a story, but in this case, there really wasn't one. The only thing that I'm left with, is that Brad Pitt has a huge range, in terms of his acting skills and his ability not to age, but I personally think that DiCaprio looks, and acts the same in all of his movies. That's not to say that he is not a good actor, but I would like to see him play a role which is out of his comfort zone. Anyway, as Tarantino takes so long to release his films, I have to say that it feels like he has lost his spark of late. Like Guy Ritchie, he hasn't hit the form of his first couple of movies, so maybe it's time for him to go back to the drawing board because he's slowly becoming a distant memory. Disappointing!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino, who also brought you Reservoir Dogs in 1992, Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill: Vol.1 & 2, Sin City, Grindhouse, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight. After the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Tarantino cut ties with Weinstein and sought a new distributor for this film, after having worked with Weinstein for his entire career. Sony Pictures agreed to take on the project, and they agreed on the $90million budget, including final cut privilege, 25% of first-dollar gross, and stipulation that the rights revert to him after 10 to 20 years. As the movie was successful, and he earned high praise for the look and cast, I can't see Tarantino thinking that it was a failure, but I personally think that it could have been much better. He did all of the hard work, in terms of portraying the 1960s, but he should have paid more attention to the plot, which really let the movie down.Budget: $90million\nWorldwide Gross: $375millionGenre: Comedy, Drama\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Julia Butters, Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Mike Moh, Luke Perry, Damian Lewis, Al Pacino, Nicholas Hammond, Samantha Robinson, Rafal Zawierucha, Lorenza Izzo, Costa Ronin, Scoot McNairy, Clifton Collins Jr., Kurt Russell, Zoe Bell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, James Remar, Damon Herriman and Lena Dunham. 4/10", "Some people will hate it. But i LOVE IT!": "Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood is a lot better then i expected. This film, like many people say, is a love letter for Hollywood. Especially the late 60s.\nThe writing is exceptional as always, and Tarantino shows that you don't need a complicated story with a specific story structure. And he still somehow makes this script into an extremely fun engaging movie like he always does.Some people don't want to watch long scenes with people just talking, but i, i think it's really fun and for some reason the scenes don't feel dragged out at all.All the acting is phenomenal, the cinematography, direction, art-direction and obviously the writing is classic Tarantino... and by that i mean it's great.The only bad thing i can think of is that in the scenes that are supposed to be the movies Rick Dalton are in, for some reason they didn't change the camera. It was still great quality so you couldn't really tell what was a movie and what wasn't. They could have used a real 16mm film camera or put on an effect in post but it was pretty confusing.\nOther then that, this movie is amazing.", "Love?Hate Breks Boomers/Millennials": "The love/hate breaks Werther it is reviewers or audience along generational lines. Boomers get it and most like it, GenX and Millennials hate because it has nothing to do with them. The movies protrayal of last '60 in Hollywood is spot on.the length this movie goes to be authentic to the period is nothing short of great. The other underlying theme of Tarantino's tribute to Steve McQueen is spectacular. Until I saw an old re-run of the late '50's TV show \"Wanted:Dead or Alive, (Starring Steve McQueen), I hadn't realized how close \"Bounty Law\" was to the original. I understand why people under 40 feel so closed off from this movie, but if everyone used that matrix, I would have never seen \"Lawrence of Arabia\", because it is set in World War I, a time I didn't know about until I watched the movie in 1962", "Wow, what a bad movie": "Pulp Fiction - masterpiece. This movie - the complete opposite. By far the worst movie of either Pitt or DiCaprio. What a waste of talent.", "Light! Camera! Action! Is it this film watchable? Yes, but this film's limelight is not so bright.": "Although, the 9th motion picture from writer director Quentin Tarantino was hyped up as retelling of the infamous Manson family murders of Aug 1969, it really isn't the main focus. There isn't even one mention of the Beach Boys or Helter Skelter. In truth, 'Once a Time in Hollywood' shines a spotlights on the trials and tribulations of show business, by following the story of a washed up TV cowboy, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) on his pursuit to manage his fame and fortune during late 1960s. Without spoiling the movie too much, while, there is no business like show business. The movie could had been a little bit better. Some parts of the 2 hour and 41 minute runtime didn't quite dominated the red carpet or kept my eyes on the screen. Much of the film's flaws come from the fact that there isn't much of an uphill struggle for Rick to stay on top. It's not like he lost a lot of money, associates or gain a dangerous nearly deadly level of substance abuse during the majority of the movie. He's still living a pretty good life in a lap of luxury with friends like stunt performer Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Because of that, I really couldn't get too invested in his side of the story. Don't get me wrong, Leo is fine in the role, but maybe an older more season actor could had made the 'Lancer' arch scenes seem visually a little more powerful to me. Plus, it would make more sense in story, why, Dalton is so traditional when it comes to change. Another thing that bugs me is that Booth & Dalton rarely have any conflict or disagreements with each other, as Cliff is way too pretty easy going with his boss. I was hoping for, at least, one skirmish, in which, the conservative Dalton would get a little mad at Cliff for his counterculture lifestyle & connection with the Manson family. Sadly, we don't even see that. As there is little conflict between him and the main villains. As for Booth, while he has a good amount of screen time, the character rarely has much of a story in this, besides laziest introduce us to the villains in the third act. In truth, the movie would work best if Tarantino establish and focus more on the relationship between Booth & the family a lot earlier in the film. It really could had save time, rather than having him aimlessly go around doing errands and feeding his dog. Because of that, I felt Booth was a little bit underused. To added to that, while Pitt was great in the role. The part should had gone to somebody a bit younger. Why, because it would make Booth's feelings for the hippie culture, a more believable & complex. It would allow a really needed boost in drama. How great the movie could had been if Booth saw both Dalton & Charles Manson (Damon Herriman) as father-figures; each with their own views on how to live life and gain notoriety. It would had make a great dilemma. Sadly, this never came. Subplot like the rumors about him, murdering his wife goes nowhere & his fight with an over the top negative portrayal of Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) really doesn't add much. To make it worst, there is really no connection between the fictional versions of actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) with Booth or Dalton besides living on the same road. You would think, in story, they would be friends, or had work together in the past. Sadly, we don't get that. Because of that, the Sharon Tate scenes like her going around shopping and watching her movies didn't really mashed well with the main plot. It felt like time waster. The movie could had made her move to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting a little more a challenging endeavor. It would intercut much better with the scenes where Dalton is trying stay on top; much in the same vein as the 'A Star is Born' films (1937-2018). Regardless, I do like the over the top 2009 'Inglorious Basterds' like altered history changing ending, somewhat. I just wish they went all the way, by killing all the Manson members. It kinda stinks that Charles didn't mean his end in a gruesome matter. Nor did they mention anything about the murders of LaBianca family or Gary Hinman. As exploitative and jarring as the whole sequence can be, none of the scenes didn't felt disrespectful to the real life victims. However, the action in this film does not have the masterful building of suspense of Tarantino's other movies. It lack focus. The same goes to the many mishmash of styles. The blockbuster CGI is jarring and in certain scenes, hurts to see, such as Leo's awkward photo shop input in the 1963 'the Great Escape'. The comedy is a bit lackluster as many of the jokes fell flat for me. The sex factor is really awkward with all those foot fetish shots. Even the storytelling is sporadic and randomly with poorly plan time jumps. The inserted narration from Kurt Russell as Randy, a stunt director is also way out of the blue. Besides the set pieces, the acting, pop culture references and music. It's still sadly not well made. Overall: The 1960s version of the television show 'Entourage' has little rewatch value for me. It was too little over the place for my taste. However, what do I know! For others. They say it's worth checking time and time again. So go seek it out if you haven't watch it. Just note, the film might not have that movie magic, fanatics of this flick were talking about. It not quite a Hollywood Icon.", "NOTHING": "This movie made me want to leave the theater early. i stuck it out, but i couldn't wait until the credits rolled. this movie is about nothing. nothing happens. there is no story or plot. it's just random scene after random scene.entire characters (ie. margot robbie) can deleted from the movie completely and it would't change a thing. this movie is filled with useless nothing. it's like QT has never heard of a deleted scene. also what a waste of margot robbie.on top of all the nothing, so many individual shots linger to a ridiculous extent. for example, scenes while a single character is driving (ie. no dialogue) will linger for a full minute. i kept looking in the background, wondering if the director was possibly trying to draw our attention to another car that was going to come into play. nope. just a really long shot of a character driving. Why?and even tho i don't require amazing dialogue for a great film, the dialogue in this movie does not come near the QT standards.the one true positive i'll give this movie is... Leo and Brad are so awesome. They prove yet again why they are both GOATs.

I read the reviews and on one side people absolutely loved it, and on the other side....They gave very low marks because they just didn't get it. That's too bad because if they did then they'd realize what a great movie this really is. It's history is most interesting to us Boomers because we were teens and twenty somethings during this era. The look at Hollywood from a behind the scenes look of what it must be like to watch your career start to fad as you find less parts offered to you.In the end this is much like the title suggests...It's a \"Fairy Tale.\" I can guarantee that you will find yourself a bit surprised about the ending.

Last scene. I waited around 2 and a half hours for a movie to start, i literally held my breath sometimes because it went on for so long and without any direction and any sense. If you still want to see this movie at least to give some credit to poor great actors that were imprisoned in this film ill give you a summary without giving out any spoilers because there is just nothing to really tell. So 1/3 of the film you will see Brad smoking, driving and drinking beer, Basically you'll spend half the film \"sitting in the back seat of a cadillaaac\"... other 1/3 Leo being a drunk cowboy actor that coughs and smokes,coughs and smokes ... you will see Margot just doing nothing for about 20 min in total maybe less , and the rest is just nonsense.

Up to that point, we haven't received any solid justification for the extreme violence that takes place.Part of the reason the ending felt out of place was that the first 3/4 of the movie also have a totally different pace and tone. Leonardo DiCaprio steals the show - I was fully entertained with his storyline and the clever throw backs to old Hollywood. The scene with California Dreamin' was extremely effective and nostalgic.

Loved how everything ACTUALLY looks in the 60s QT did an amazing job with that the details were so so good. The costumes were absolutely cool and the music was just unbelievable really loved them and they were a great choice. Loved that 60% of the movie is actually a real story but QT changed a few things with it. Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate was a right choice she really looked exactly like her but didnt like that Margot Robbie didnt have a lot of lines and i dont know why, for a minute i forget that she was even in the movie. Felt like the movie didnt really have a plot it was just talking about each character (Rick Dalton, Sharon Tate and Cliff Booth) and how are they living. The movie was a little bit boring in some scenes for example there are a lot of scenes of Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) driving his car or just walking for a long time and all of these things make the person who's watching the movie feel bored.

Don't miss.", "A movie that beautifully captures a different era": "This movie is worth the watch. Yes, it is a very long movie, and I almost didn't see it because of that reason. However, there is not one dull moment throughout the whole thing. Quentin Tarantino did it again -- he made a movie that will most definitely become a Hollywood icon. He incorporated events that actually occurred; even though they may have been altered a bit for the purpose of entertainment, the events are based on true history, and that is what I admire about the script itself. The character development is another thing that is worth watching. This film doesn't watch like a normal Tarantino film -- no blood, no guts, no fighting. The first two hours are cinematically 60s retro. The last hour is when Tarantino comes in with the killing, fighting, blood and guts. It's quite a change, however, it is necessary for the movie to keep that flow going. Amazing film overall.", "The emperor's new clothes.": "Folks like me and you, come to see a Tarantino Film with great actors Leo and Brad.

The classic fable tale, summs everything up, folks are gonna lie to themselves, and claim this is unique and sophiscated blah blah blah. Unless you belong to that specific, smart group of people, you aint going to enjoy the 3hours long show. What we have here is the emperor's new clothes dilemma.", "Once Upon a Time ...driving around Hollywood circa 1969": "I wasn't as excited to see this movie as I have with most Tarantino movies, especially since I heard from a friend who's opinion I value, that it wasn't very good, so my expectations were low. I heard most people walked out 75% through, which is unfortunate, since the end makes up for what the rest is lacking. If it wasn't for Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) then the movie would have been much worse. I understand that people loved this movie, especially people from Hollywood and rabid Tarantino fans, where he m could make a movie filmed entirely on the female characters feet, and he'd be called a genius. Now the 3 main scenes with Cliff are excellent. However 75% of the movie is clips from shows and movies that don't exist. There is a lot of painfully long driving scenes as well. I think that Tarantino had a simple idea, and made a fictional version of 1969, that takes place in the Tarantino universe. I get that character development is important, however, an actor having a career crisis does not need long clips of his previous work shown to the audience, firsthand. Maybe they could have been in the background of scenes where things are actually happening. It's also not important to show in almost real time, how long it takes to get to Cliff's apartment from Rick's (DiCaprio) house. I think this movie has a few good scenes, and a great take on certain things from Tarantino's universe, and the rest is filler. What about the party? Mostly with people who play famous people, and that's all they do in the movie (aka Damien Lewis as Steve McQueen). Not essential to the movie. The scene could have been cut and the movie would have been fine. Same with a character going to the movies. It just goes on and on. If you take out all the filler, you have maybe a 45 minute movie. All that being said, I really did like this movie for what it ended up being. I just wish there was more content relevant to the main story. Cliff's backstory, and character could have been developed much more! They left a big stigma with his character, ambiguous. I know this was probably intentional, but when you have long clips of Rick's shows, and movies, or long pointless driving scenes, it seems like you'd go to character development that the audience would actually be curious about. This film is probably his most pretentious, and with the exception of the 3 main scenes with Cliff (which made the movie) it was very bland.", "Drama": "Subject line sez all.But... I have to write more, so I will. Odd to think, but this flick comes closest to Jackie Brown in tone and purpose. The difference is that QT adapted Jackie Brown from a novel, and he wrote Once Upon a Time pretty much from the ground, up.But it's pretty much a bestiary of types. I felt that QT hits the ground running with that utterly fantastic confab in the bar between DiCaprio's character and Pacino's character. It sets the tone for the whole movie: Who is Dalton, who is Booth, and what do they mean to us, today? Whether that question rings true as a relevant question hinges on whether Once Upon a Time is true drama or not.I say; it's a relevant question, and Once Upon a Time is true drama.Dig it.", "Excellent movie!": "I loved it for a few reasons:\n1.

As anticipated as any Tarantino film can be, does this one live up to the hype?1. Set in 1969 Los Angeles, the story involves fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his stunt-double/close friend Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they try to salvage some acclaim in Hollywood within their twilight years in the industry. Firstly, as simple as that plot may sound, a film like this takes many turns and (as with most Tarantino films) stories converge. Personally, I expected intertwining story-lines but not such a dull script. With a run-time of 2hrs 41mins, this film could easily have lost 60-45mins as it is plagued with tons of unnecessary and dragging scenes. I don't mind lengthy films, but the biggest crime a lengthy feature can make is to be boring. Capturing the audiences' attention should be first priority.2. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Pitt is no doubt the best part of this film. It's about time these two have worked together and they both do their best to keep you invested in their slice of the story. On the other hand, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate is completely useless to say the least. Her character is there for no reason at all and contributes absolutely nothing to the overall plot. Her scenes should have been cut from the final theatrical version entirely. Many other A-list actors make cameos throughout but are in no way outstanding judging by performances. No disrespect to the late Luke Perry, but anyone could have played his part as he utterly insignificant in his short role.3. This film succeeds a lot more when it shifts gere into comedy and focuses on DiCaprio and Pitt. The secondary plot (as shown in the trailers) involves the 'Manson Family', which leads to a rather entertaining and funny climax, but actual events are in no way depicted as they were in real life regarding the infamous cult and its leader Charles Manson. The script just didn't seem to quite find its voice or direction. The editing needed to be tighter, and again, a lot of scenes should have been left on the cutting-room floor. One film I really admire with a similar tone is 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' (2005) which is probably a better and more entertaining film than this. I found myself hard to stay invested in the story and was suffering from cinematic fatigue by the time it was over.'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' is a clear definition of an overly ambitious film that aimed high but hit low. I'm an admirer of many of Tarantino's works, but this certainly isn't a film I'd wanna watch again in theaters or even on television.", "even better and arguably more satisfying than \"Inglorious Basterds\"": "This film, like inglorious basterds is shaping a positive scenario for a tragedy that occurred. In my opinion this film did this perfectly and was a masterpiece. (I still love inglorious basterds) Anyone who gives this film anything other than a ten is delusional and is an insult to Quentin Tarantino's work.", "Thats a Tarantino movie": "The reason for the title is for those who say ''hey thats so different than other tarantino movies, it was boring blablabalb''. Stop it. It is nothing but a tarantino movie. Wilhelm scream in the very beggining, lots of foot and indispensable weird action scene. These are the most remarkable ones. I think people dont understand the idea of the film. It is not really about the characters or what happenes to them. It is about the holywood itself at that time as you can understand from the title of the movie. He is such an enthusiastic film lover which bring him where he is now. Back in time when he was working at the movie store he saw every movie in that store. Western and asian movies were his favorites. Thats why his movies are like bloody, action, sword and exaggrated fight ect. He finds it FUN. I am writing these because he has all the guts to make a movie like that and make profit out of it.(I think profit is not the priority for him at that point)I appraciated for what he done to this industry and show that if you truly passionate about your interest you can do it.The movie was not the most enjoyable or his best but it is worth to watch because his name is on it. Thanks.", "Classic": "Not Violent or bloody as other Tarantino films, it's quite different while the cinematography, colors and Art direction takes you back to the golden days it's bit slow makes u wait untill the end to get the Tarantino satisfaction, This film has some very Great acting from DiCaprio, brad pitt and others like that little girl", "A lovingly crafted throwback to a bygone era": "Most, if not all of us know that beloved director Quentin Tarantino adores his cinema and the history behind it and if for some reason you didn't know this, you will after watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Tarantino's love letter and nostalgic look back on the bygone \"golden era\" of the industry that his dedicated his life to, this slowly paced and undeniably indulgent film may alienate some viewers chasing more of a hard plot, featuring less scenes of Brad Pitt picturesquely driving a vintage car around lovingly recreated sets, but for those that fall under Hollywood's charismatic charms, Tarantino's film will act as pure cinematic ecstasy.Quite possibly Tarantino's most easily accessible (even if its many throwbacks and wink wink moments may not hit with everyone) and definitely most sentimental film, Hollywood's breezy plot line of Leonardo DiCaprio's aging actor and alcoholic Rick Dalton coming to terms with his dwindling career prospects, taking place around his long-standing friendship with stunt double and best \"only\" friend Cliff Booth (played by a scene stealing Brad Pitt) and the Sharon Tate/hippie filled surrounds of his hometown, allows Tarantino to go all in on his love letter to a time gone by that ends up feeling like a dreamlike trip to the past, that's carefully considered construction makes it come alive in the best way cinema can offer.From greyhound buses in the background, radio ads taking place as our characters traverse the colourful locations, TV programs blurring from the insides of a rundown trailer situated at the back of a drive in movie theatre or the signs of the Hollywood strip being lit up for a night of entertainment and good times, Hollywood's lived in and lovingly staged surroundings become a character unto themselves as Tarantino takes his cast and us as viewers on a journey through a production that clearly comes from the heart and soul of fan that we should be thankful to for inviting us along for the ride.This sense of playfulness and care extends wonderfully to Tarantino's main cast who have an absolute blast bringing the filmmakers renowned script work to life in fun and exciting ways.While not Tarantino's most quotable or laugh out loud funny pieces of scripted work, Hollywood's deeply considered and even emotionally powerful work (Dalton's discussion with a child actress or breakdown in his set trailer particular highlights) is wonderfully played out by his expert cast and while there's gems to be found in cameos from the likes of Kurt Russell, Bruce Dern, Timothy Olyphant, Dakota Fanning and Al Pacino, its Tarantino's key trio that further ensure Hollywood will go down as one of the year's best and most memorable offerings.Front and centre for most, the dream pairing of DiCaprio and Pitt plays out just as joyously as you'd expect with both actors bringing their A-game to this unique offering.Some may bemoan the seemingly pointless scenes these two characters sometimes are involved in but should you just sit back and enjoy what these performers are bringing to the table, they quickly become two of Tarantino's most memorable character creations with Booth in particular a genuine classic, with Pitt's Oscar worthy turn as one seriously cool but also potentially bad guy stunt man a highlight of proceedings.Tarantino with help from Margot Robbie also make sure that the film's lovingly staged and whimsical depiction of the tragic Sharon Tate is a powerful component of the film and as we get an insight into her brief but memorable time in Hollywood, playing out around the lives of our two main characters, Tate is given wonderful and heartfelt time in the spotlight in this Tarantino affair.It would be remiss also to not pay respects to what I would argue to be Tarantino's best endgame yet and while not wanting to enter into spoiler filled territory, Hollywood's final stanza is likely to draw shock, gasps and even belly laughs in what becomes a conclusion audience members won't soon forget.Final Say -Far from a typical mass-audience crowd pleaser, Tarantino has here indulged his love for cinema and its players like never before and while this is likely to alienate just as many as it enraptures, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a stunning example of cinematic craft and imagination that is made all the more wonderful by its killer cast that are clearly (just like us willing participants) having the time of their lives.4 \u00c2\u00bd flamethrowers out of 5", "No plot, only 1 relatable character: A total nothing movie": "What did I just watch? Nothing happens in the first two hours. Brad Pitt is the only redeemable thing about the film. The film meanders and builds on asbolutely nothing. It's one of those films where you keep asking yourself, \"where is this even going? It better get good.\" But it doesn't. Total waste of time. Basically an old Hollywood circle  that accomplishes NOTHING. I expected more from this movie, and Tarantino. Especially with a 9/10 on IMDB.", "Slow Movie But Still Enjoyable.": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood looked good from the start and the movie itself was not disappointing at all. Fantastic acting was delivered by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt as they portrayed their characters very well. As for Margot Robbie, she was advertised as one of the main stars but she didn't get much screen time as expected which was very disappointing but for the time Margot was on screen, she didn't disappoint at all.Another thing with this movie that I see personally as a con is the slow speed most of the movie was, I know that is Quentin's idea for films but in my opinion for a film like this I would have loved to see more speed for some of the scenes that was slowed. That was the only con I mainly saw in this movie and otherwise, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was very enjoyable to watch and it is for sure worth taking a visit to see.", "Once upon a time .. there was fictional revenge": "I'm usually sure Tarantino would make a movie so solid and atmospheric that is would convince me to like it by time if not right the first time I watch it. Once upon a time did convince pretty much by the first time.There is a standard Tarantino movie in our heads, like there is a standard Woody Allen in our head and if a director breaks with our expectations we're either disappointed that he/she did not fulfill them/doesn't work well or we're blown away. Once upon on time ... in Hollywood is one of those movies that didn't even try to be a typical Tarantino: less violence and people dying all over the movie, filmed like an homage to a certain time and making of a movie, \"meaningless\" scenes etc.\nFirst I experienced the feeling of disappointment but there came a point where the movie told me what's its actually about and I felt like \" Ok you got me Tarantino\". The whole concept worked for itself although it's not the typical Tarantino storytelling. The atmosphere is outstanding as the actors are and of course you feel the Tarantino handwriting in it. In this movie you have to be able to enjoy some longer scenes that are not made to transport a certain part of the story by being a clever inserted piece of puzzle. Some scenes are just made for giving the movie atmosphere and shaping characters more than necessary like Tarantino fell in love with them. The movie could without a doubt be shorter still make the same sense without those long scenes. I'm not sure if I would have liked that too much though. I really loved that Tarantino didn't even try to be the Tarantino of the past, that he changes, giving the movie what is new on his mind. I'm sure expects of his fans to be progressive in watching his movies and not conservative.The only reason why I'm not giving 10/10 is the motif of revenge which he uses in too much of his movies and does it in this one either. That made me think about why he just can't find another reason to make a movie. Of course you can say \"Why should he if it works perfectly fine?\" but this would make him appear a little more colorful and a bit less restricted. But to be fair it is the best movie of 2019 I watched so far and one of his best works at all. I loved it.", "Fantastic": "Maybe not Tarantino's best outing, but the performances from Pitt and DiCaprio make this worthwhile.\nI liked the alternate history of Inglorious Basterds, and was expecting a violent saving of Tate, Folger, et al, in the same vein.\nInstead I watched one of the best unassuming tough guys since John McClane and his bully (dog) wreak havoc on a bunch of overconfident nutjobs, and finally a man apart get redemption.\nThis movie was damn near perfection.", "This is a must see!": "If you are one who likes any of Tarantino's other films or if you really like well designed movies than this is something you have to see! This movie was very well done and is incredibly interesting.Tarantino really does take the whole movie back in time and makes it feel completely like it is 1969. Brad Pitt's acting was very top notch and DiCaprio's is so interesting.This movie does start off kinda slow, but very charming about it. Throughout the movie it just keeps building up and up and up! Leading to an ending that completely surprised me. If you know how the Tate murder happened and are expecting it than you will be surprised by this twist they pull out at the last second. (Fictional ending)", "Pure hollywood navel gazing": "Didn't even manage to finish it, which is very rare for me - I enjoyed most or at least some of Tarantino's movies, but this one was just too boring and pointless. I'm generally just not a fan of such hollywood movies about hollywood, and this movie appeared to be a perfect example of the self-indulgence of such overrated movies. The hollywood world is just not that interesting and important as hollywood thinks.", "Finally something creative!": "It's been awhile since I've seen a original script. Quentin Tarantino did a great job with this one. At times it can be a little slow but it's all worth it in the end! I'll definitely be picking this one up on Blu Ray when it comes out!", "The 2019 masterpiece that every single person should watch.": "Astounding performance of DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie . BEST movie 2019 by far. Good dose of comedy and a love letter to Hollywood It self.", "Crap movie": "If it was not for the major actors, we would have turned it off within 30min. No storyline, you don't even know whats going on.\nIts a major disappointment and a waist of 2 hrs!", "The end of Tarantino": "I watched this with a friend, we are huge movie fans and Tarantino fans. At the end we looked at each other and simultaneous said \"What the hell were they thinking\". He (Tarantino) thinks casting big names, making a hype will make it work? No sir, this is end of career, reputation and brain. Total scam of a picture. What were they thinking? How can DiCaprio and Pacino agree to do this to their respected resume. Just for a paycheck? A joke really and a bad one sadly. It's like Tarantino is empty, nothing left. That in it's self is a harsh but true reality after seeing this movie. But how can great actors agree to be in such a bad movie, that is what really baffled us. It just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Pacino is a Hollywood clown? DiCaprio is the action star? Pitt plays second fiddle?I'm not one to think conspiracy but this 7.9 sure smells funny to me, all the 10 star reviews have 1500+ likes, the 5 stars and lower not so much. That's the Hollywood machine working for you I guess.", "In One Word - FLACCID.": "Tarantino is an idiot, and if you enjoy his films - well.... For me this film has 2 strikes on it before it ever leaves the hamper; Tarantino directed/wrote it & DeCrappyowe starred in it. Never got the over exaggerated hype regarding Pulp Friction either. The weak role Pitt played did not improve this mess either; perhaps the Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses from the 99 cent store were supplied to impress someone? Never going to happen. Even an appearance from Pacino couldn't save this expired tripe. The story line in this movie is non-existent; it starts somewhere and leads nowhere, yet another common Tarantino trait. If a young child in a film has to speak up to tell you \"that was the best acting I've ever seen\" - you're already sagging pretty damn low. If you have the limited mental capacity of an 8 year old child - you might enjoy this film - I was NOT impressed, not by any of it. Yet another film that I would never visit the cinema to watch - not even close to being worth the investment in time or money. Might as well pitch this film into the same feces heap as the Joker or Blair Witch. Wondering why this mess has such a high average rating - as most of the reviews are not very positive.", "What does this movie is all about?": "I'm not sure what is the motive of making this movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that spans for minutes but doesn't have any relation to the story. Wait, there is no story as such. Such a dissapointment. If this was not by a renowned direcor and top rated actors, this wouldn't have even been released in theatres.\nIt is like visiting a film city with all sets depecting old hollywood locations and wathching different movies being shot, not related to one another.", "One of the best": "Leo's acting is amazing in this, really feel for the character he plays, everyone was great acting in this, nothing less of tarentino, camera and direction was epic in my opinion and have been realy interested in mason since this production, think he was robbed on awards, one of my favourite films ever out of my top 100.", "Hard to explain but worth every minute": "This movie is so hard to try to describe to people. It's a \"movie within a movie\" type scenario with characters that you may be familiar with. Great acting, visually perfect, and a great soundtrack. 2 1/2 hours long but it doesn't feel like it. Go see it!", "Superb Acting .... Horrible Story": "I think the title of my review speaks for itself.I've been a big fan of Quentin's good work over the last 3 decades.First and foremost the acting is stellar. Anyone whose not a Leo fan cannot deny that he is an exceptional actor. Even Pitt gets into character so well it just fits.The other characters although well acted are just random in their development.This movie starts well but then goes nowhere. It has a story to tell but Tarantino doesn't know how to do it. If you just want to see some good acting then sit back and enjoy. The directing is also great, even a bad story can be told in a way that is entertaining.For someone as critically acclaimed as Tarantino, let me be very critical here. Unfortunately the story takes a really bad turn at the end, almost as if someone was desperate in badly needing unrealistic violence which doesn't place well in this movie at all. This is what made the movie go from boring to bad. The exaggeration of the violence displayed by Tarantino ruins the film.Tarantino's objective of mixing fact & fiction is poorly blended. Much like adding beer to a smoothie. Whereas it worked well in Tarantino's \"Inglorious\" it's just rushed in here to quickly at the end.The cinematic idea of telling a side story that revolves around a bigger story, is really kind of a waste of true story. A double tragedy if you will.The whole \"what if\" angle is poorly executed simply because the \"true story\" is not clearly revealed to the audience. A few simple extra minutes of story telling on the facts would have easily changed the outcome of the movie.Apparently Tarantino demanded \"carte blanche when making the movie when he probably should have listened to anyone else before wasting a $100 million good ones.Who knows it could have been his directorial \"debut\" as a great writer of dramas. Approaching 60 it's time to put down the gore comic books and mature a little or a lot.", "one of the best movie I have seen in awhile.": "It was one of the best films I have seen in awhile. I kept thinking I wish in real life it had ended that way. It had all kind of elements scary moments and fun moments. Great acting all around", "Totally Tarantino": "Don't listen to the bad critics.\nSome people claims to be longtime Tarantino fans, but they don't like this movie.\nWell, then your clearly not a Tarantino fan, because this movie contain everything Tarantino stands for:\n1. Casting great skilled actors, in even the smallest part!\n2. Casting wellknown actors even in the smallest parts!\n3. Casting actors youd forgot about long time ago.

However, he ignores all this in \"Once Upon a Time .. In Hollywood\", his most personal film.\nUnlike all his filmography, in this ninth film Tarantino pays homage to the city that saw him born. The first hour is used to walk the streets of the time and develop characters in the way that only this director knows how to do. There is no breakthrough in a story, the important thing is not that, but to commemorate an era, a city and the cinema itself. This film declares love for movies and a way of making cinema that no longer exists today. Tarantino gives us a representation of the cinema and his vision of it, with an ending so fun and dazzling that the initial expectations end up totally inverted in a turn that is absolutely perfect.\nThe love for the cinema is present in every shot, the love for the city that saw him grow shines in every frame and Tarantino shows his most personal facet in a film that will be remembered as one of the most different in his filmography and as a statement from love to passion for making movies.", "Another disappointment from Tarantino": "With the exception of the end, the film consisted largely of unimportant and unnecessary dialogues and scenes.\nThe film was never exciting and at 161 minutes the boredom was almost unbearable.

The last half an hour or so sees the film go up several gears, the ending was great, the best part of the film.The major strengths here, the visuals, if you love the sixties, this will appeal to you, it looks incredible, the visuals are sublime. The acting is awesome, not a single quibble from me about the acting, DiCaprio is absolutely superb, and deserving of accolades.A good story, the issue for me was pacing, the story takes time to hot up, and if I'm honest, beging to knit together.It's a good film, you just need to stick with it. 6/10.", "Absolutely terrific!": "Seen it twice already, both times in a movie theater. It is perfect from start to finish. Every minute in this film is interesting. As a period piece the scenes are flawless. (I was alive in 1969 and yes, I live in Los Angeles but not sure if that makes a difference.) I feel sorry for the people who say it is long and boring. If your attention span is feeble, or if you watch at home while working, cooking dinner or reading a magazine, then maybe TV programming is a better fit for you than feature films. The soundtrack including commercials from that time is awesome. I will watch this movie many. many times over. A+", "A tribute to Hollywood and Tarantino's wit.": "Starting off this review I must say this film is not for everyone, not because it's an \"over the top Tarantino style film\", although I must say this is the least excessive of his films that I've seen. This movie is a comedy, that has a heart and makes you feel for its characters. Tarantino proves that he is the king of dialogue, I was glued to the screen for every second of this movie. Leo gives his best performance that I've seen from him and Pitt is an excellent supporting role as well, the two's chemistry makes you wonder how they've never been in a movie together before. You are fully transported and immersed in the culture of the late 60s and what Hollywood was like then, while seeing the parallels between a successful TV star (Leo) and a successful Movie star (Margot Robbie). Tarantino does this masterfully and has made this movie my favorite of his and my favorite movie of the year (so far). There's a lot to take in with this movie (at a nearly 3 hour run time), and I could break down certain scenes (the last 10 minutes were absolute perfection), but this movie isn't just a masterpiece through its acting and technical aspects, it is just a FUN movie, from start to finish. Although primarily a comedy it covers just about every single genre you can think of, which will have you leaving the theater fully satisfied. I give it a 9.3/10!If you want to hear my full thoughts including spoiler discussion, the next episode of my podcast, Reel Sons of Cinema, will be posted this Tuesday 7/30 on iTunes and Spotify!

But not dry enough not to concoct this epic bluff nobody who's anybody in Hollywood dares to call.", "Inexplicably bad": "This movie has highly rated actors and producers in it, which should make it an excellent film. But alas that is a fallacy. It is incoherent and annoying to watch.Quentin Tarantino has made many magnificent movies in the past, but as Writer and Director for this plot/script he missed the ball completely.

Tarantino as always, Di Caprio and Pitt prove their actor talents again. Thanks all cast team for this great movie.", "Like watching paint dry": "There are some good parts to the film, however these are vastly overshadowed by incredibly boring scenes, it was the equivalent of watching paint dry, definitely the worst of the Tarantino films by far", "Occasionally Meandering but Always Intriguing": "We're not going to lie: Quentin Tarantino's ninth film, 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' is not an easy film to review. There are plenty of good, bad, and indifferent parts of the movie to touch on, all further complicated by the fact that the bar for any Tarantino picture is already incredibly high-perhaps unfairly so.What do we mean by that last part? Well, overall the film has been received quite positively by film critics, though Tarantino acolytes seem to be a little more tepid about it. But what if this film weren't written and directed by Tarantino, and instead was made by a lesser-known entity? Would it be considered a masterful piece of filmmaking, a breakout success largely unparalleled by anything else released so far this year? There's no actual answer to this. We simply wonder ...Meanwhile, let's start with the bad stuff. The middle of the film is somewhat meandering, meaning this is the third film in a row that Tarantino could've trimmed some fat to make the movie that much more invigorating. And what do his three most recent movies all have in common? The absence of Tarantino's long-time editor, Sally Menke, who tragically died at the age of 56 while hiking in Beachwood Canyon during a heat wave.Furthermore, a key component of Tarantino's movies is the way he incorporates music into the film, choosing the perfect song to complement what is seen on the screen. Our biggest gripe with 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' is that the songs were often abruptly cut short, never being allowed to fully play out and truly meld with the action unfolding on screen.On the positive side, the film is about 90% less violent than a typical Tarantino flick, meaning it'll be a lot more accessible to moviegoers who previously avoided the filmmaker due to his penchant for frequently utilizing gory deaths. This makes the film closer to 'Jackie Brown' in both substance and style than most of his other works.Lastly, 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' proves once and for all that Leonardo DiCaprio is among the finest and most talented actors of his generation. He is downright captivating in every single scene. And considering he is an actor playing an actor-one of the hardest roles there is to pull off in Hollywood-it makes his performance that much more extraordinary.", "Darn": "Could not finish the first 30 mins\nDo not waste your time. Not worth the hype.", "A movie for people who appreciate and understand filmmaking": "What an incredible movie, I can't wait to watch it again.

If you appreciate the art of filmmaking and how much detail Tarantino put into this movie you will love it. Incredible performances by Pitt and Decaprio.", "A Dive into Cinematic Pseudo-History": "Tarantino is a master of his craft. That probably goes without saying at this point. We have seen it 8 times before and we have seen it for a ninth time now. I think whether you enjoyed the plot of any of the films is one thing, but to not see the cinematic artistry would be a sad oversight. Each scene and action and piece of dialogue is crafted in a meticulous and careful manner. It's really clear to see that Tarantino pays close attention to almost everything he does.What is the most impressive and interesting to me is the ability to set the period. From the cars to the building facades to the music to the clothing, everything feels like it should be in that time period. I have to be honest, I didn't live then and there. As with anything set in the past, there is the lens through which we gaze back and the nostalgia or criticism that clouds our judgement and makes us see it differently. We will never be able to perfectly recreate the times in the past, but we can try. And Tarantino has done an incredible job of it. It feels like 1969 in every way that it possibly could, and never strays from that.The sound design does an incredible job in this regard. It is often hard to tell the music from the sounds of the world. Is that song coming from the radio? Can the characters hear it or is it just me? It keeps you in the world and in the frame of mind of the characters. What did they hear in 1969?As for the actual story-line, I see from other reviews that there is disagreement around it. I understand that. Tarantino films can be polarizing. Sometimes there is too much dialogue and drawn out scenes. Sometimes people say that there is no point of a scene or that the story is too slow. I don't personally agree with that, but I accept and understand it. Sitting through a nearly 3 hour dialogue heavy movie is not for everyone, and that's okay. But to me the payoff is worth it.Knowing about Sharron Tate and Charles Manson's family is immensely helpful in having fun watching this film, as others have pointed out. It helps to create that dramatic tension and the build up, questioning what is going to happen. Tarantino is masterful at defying expectations, even in seemingly historical events. As we saw in his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, we cannot take anything for granted and we cannot predict where Tarantino is going to take the plot. This makes it so exciting and thrilling to watch.We got what we expected out of Tarantino. Amazing dialogue with slow and drawn out soliloquies and conversations. Out of place dubbing that somehow works with the film. Gratuitous violence and blood that makes you laugh at the ridiculousness of it. Amazing acting from an amazing cast. For me, it's what I wanted and what I got.

It is meant to be evocative.": "\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" builds slowly, but there is fun in the journey.It has all the elements we expect from a Quentin Tarantino movie, including the violence. There are multiple storylines, goofy characters passing through, multiple timelines, it even plays as different kinds of movies, including a quasi-documentary that keeps intruding...and tilting the movie off-balance with its voice-over narration that seems so out of place, it caused me to think it was inserted so as to eliminate an additional hour of movie.What Tarantino does in the telling of this story has been done in other movies. But I've never seen it done with THIS story, and though I've seen all of Quentin Tarantino's movies, I've never before seen it done by him.\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is uneven. It has great set-pieces, brilliant scenes featuring bravura performances, and then it has sequences that fall flat, causing the movie to deflate a bit. But over its length it builds towards a climax that comes as a true surprise, and along the way Tarantino gets great performances out of his three leads: Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Margot Robbie.\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a tribute to the paradigm-changing power of storytelling. It is sweet and sentimental, but in ways that are uniquely Tarantino's.", "2 1/2 hours in, and still waiting for it to start...": "The trailer looked like a lot of fun. Metacritic score was 85%. IMDB score was 8.7. It had to be great, right?Wrong! As others have commented, there is absolutely no plot. It looks like Tarantino, Brad and Leo had a lot of fun filming lots of random scenes, and an editor spent a quick afternoon splicing them all together. \"Oh, I know... let's put Leo in the Great Escape!\". \"Let's put Leo in a tedious western and show 30 mins of the making of it!\". Sounds, great eh?Tedious. Tedious. Tedious. I was tempted to get up and leave many times, but was hopeful that the movie would eventually get into gear and show some semblance of plot. Nope... not until the last 15 mins does anything happen. And I hated that scene too.I heard that Tarantino said this is his penultimate movie.

Leonardo DiCaprio's character is also very interesting - how he examines his life and arcs.I was born after the time of this film, but I really enjoyed the little details in the visuals. Amazingly detailed. This is the kind of film you watch again just to see all the signatures of the time.

I never did that, because I believe in the adage, \"if you have nothing good to say, then don't say it\". On this occasion I have to say that this overlong, self-indulgent and rewritten version of Hollywood history, is one of the most heartwarming pieces of art currently being exhibited to the paying and baying public. I was immersed in a gloriously shot and lit, parallel universe. The script was near perfect as was the acting, and \"wow\", the acting by the way, was as natural as a conversation with your mum.\nNo spoilers here for me and just a generalised point of view. I indulged in the IMAX experience and relished every scene, unwittingly anticipating the colour and soundtrack of the next. I like many of QT's movies, but this is his best and like all good crafts, the more you do them the better you and they get.

It takes place in 1969 and we follow the struggles of Dalton and his career, and his neighbor Sharon Tate, and the possibility of events that occurred in August of that year.There is a lot to unpack in this film, and I'll be honest, it's late and I don't want to right now. Could this be telling a story of how Tarantino's own career is starting to wind down (intentionally, as he wants to quit at 10 films)? Who cares.I loved this damn movie. This is right up there with the best of his and could be my favorite, well, maybe not because I could never cheat on Resevoir Dogs...But man. What a great film. It's long, but didn't feel long, so that says something about it. Great performances, well shot and scored, some hilarious lines and a bonkers final act.I loved it.

But, BECAUSE of the twist, the memory of that awful step in time has been flipped into a playful win for the good guys!In true Tarantino form, it was odd & interesting, & drew me in immediately. The dirty bare feet can go though & all the smoking damn near choked me out just watching! Haha!It's so difficult to for people to grasp the hazards of smoking, but after watching a person die from COPD & hearing him wish he'd quit the habit while he was young, makes my heart go out to those who struggle.

I am turned off by excessive violence, particularly for no purpose. But I decided to go see this one as I was told the violence was not as bad. My sister raved about the script, which I found so-so. The movie dragged in places and was not particularly clever The view of Hollywood in those days was very clich\u00c3\u00a9. They had the actors go to all the normal Hollywood watering holes, so that took no thought on the part of the writer. It was a bland story, and then when it went towards the end, I was horrified that we were trying to find humor when we knew what really happened at the end of that night. Yes, it was a fairytale and yes, Sharon Tate's sister okayed this movie, but I found it offensive for younger people as this will be their only reference of the Manson story. The Manson girls were portrayed as pretty and funny, not the ( possibly brainwashed ) sociopaths that they were.My grades:Script: C\nDirection: B\nActing: A- **Note: Brad Pitt deserves a Oscar nomination.

It was not in your face like Pulp Fiction; it was not streamlined to a story like ReservoirDogs and Jackie Brown; it was not heavy with action like Kill Bill 1/2. However, it is a period piece like his last three movies, The Hateuful Eight, Django Unchained, and Inglorious Basterds.It is a beautifully told story which allows the exploration of alternate timelines (he has done the before in Inglorious Bastards). It does tend to form as a story slower than most of his writings, but it is a story which needs to be told at this pace.Many classic movies in history follow the same pace. I think this is why he used this type of storytelling. He is comparing classic movies of culture; the timeless storytelling moviegoers were used to many years ago.What I liked the most about this movie is QT purposely integrated his classic fashionable trademarks within to ensure everyone knows this is a powerful story told only the way he knows how. He used his trademark of showing feet more in this movie than any other. In all of his movies those feet are always attached to incredibly beautiful women (one exception is Carradine in KB II). I think he may be doing this to show his feelings about Hollywood and this era.Also, just to let you know, when you see this, make sure to stay through the credits. There is a scene to see.Hats off to you Mr. Tarintino for this beautiful piece of storytelling. Take a bow sir! Encore, Encore!", "Wake me up when it's over": "Guys, we don't have to pretend we like this because Quentin wrote and directed it. Maybe it's so brilliant that I personally missed the point of it, but my family and I, we love Quentin's movies, and I kid you not, we all took turns falling asleep during the movie (and we watched it at 6pm-not even bedtime). We now collectively know the cure to insomnia. The only reason we kept pressing on was because we were hopeful that the best was yet to come; unfortunately, the movie was pretty one-note and hardly felt like it belonged to him. I compare the experience to watching The Godfather 3, which I wouldn't even consider part of the franchise. It's just better to believe it never happen. I don't want to say Quentin has lost his touch because as expected, the soundtrack was smashing, the aesthetics were there, but I would say he had a major off-day. It had the right formula of romanticizing Hollywood stars of the past. He could have done so much more with it knowing how creative he is, but he didn't do anything that was impressive or unique. Inserting Leo in old movie/tv scenes was very Forrest Gump. It didn't have the usual edginess and stylishness of a Tarantino film...except maybe the foot fetish. I'm sorry because it's such a dismissive thing to say, but this was truly a waste of time. And I know that Bruce Lee scene was supposed to be some sort of highlight, but it was predictable and just not funny.", "true movie lovers": "I enjoyed every moment of the movie.

I'd like to say this is the first QT Comedy?Rick Dalton (Leo) & Cliff (Pitt) are characters you wish you could see more of.\nLeo is such a great actor it was amusing to see him as an actor in this. The breakdown in his trailer was phenomenal \"I'm gonna blow your gottdamn brains out tonight\"...looking in a mirror prepping for his next scene.\nAlso the part where Rick notices Sharon and Roman next door to him was great acting by Leo as well.I wanna write more about the movie but I'll end and say that I wish this was what actually happened in Hollywood.\nCliff and his big red dog.\nGreat movie QT.", "Watch the movie for what it is, not for what you expect it to be": "First: If you expect this movie to be \"a Tarantino\" movie, to be full of action or anything, please just don't watch it, you won't get it.\nI watched the movie without expecting anything and also without any knowledge about the Manson murders and really like it. As you probably know \"Once upon a Time...\" is how fairy tales begin, not action movies or how I like it to say - movies to be enjoyed, not consumed. This is a fairy tale taking you back in time, where one had a laissez-faire style of life, everything was a bit slower and Classical Hollywood Cinema was made. Nowadays everything has to be fast and full of action or you can't satisfy the average joe who needs to consume movies to get a break from work. Most of the movies produced over the last few years aren't worth watching as they are just another superhero reboot, loaded with action or another pointless comedy without any deeper meaning, without hidden messages, without something that let's you think about the movie or a concept of it in general. That's sad and also why most of the people don't get this movie and give it a bad rating. If you like Tarantino solely for Action and Bloody movies, then you don't understand his life's work and why it is so brilliant with all it's facets, unique camera angles, hidden meaning, social criticism, ...\np.s. Maybe it's worth mentioning that I'm just 23 years old and still think like this without even being able to see pre 2000 movies at their release.", "Once upon a time": "Bad movie.\nWhile its not new to anybody acquainted to the man's works that tarantino loves to indulge himself in pastiche like cinematography but in most of his other films that comes off as a bleeding through effect of his emotional bond with the films and genres that he is referencing. In this one however, his most pastiched one so far , not only he does what he usually does but he also neglects the value of his source material by making fun of the same kind of films he build his whole career on referencing. For example the infamous Bruce Lee scene. You can say that Bruce Lee was not the nicest or most humble person in the set and that is okay, that is not the point. The point is that, HIS CHARACTERIZATION was humorous. He was written to act as a big mouthed fool and you get the impression that essentially anyone could beat him up if they wanted it, which to me seems uncomfortably odd considering all the nods to Bruce Lee films in Tarantino's filmography such as Beatrix Kiddo's outfit in Kill Bill. Not only that but he dismissively makes fun of western spaghettis. The same man that literally build his career on top of pastiche style remaking each and every style of European exploitation films. The funny thing to me is that he ridicules western spaghetti, he makes fun of kung fu films but what he DOES NOT DO is make fun of american westerns.I also never saw one Tarantino film that was this openly reactionary. The film makes every hippie look like an assassin, it deviates the guilt for the charles mason murders from mason himself to the hippie culture. Also is really weird that he makes the hippies speak in left wing cliche slang when they were following charles mason who literally had a swastika on his forehead. And if that weren't enough the film is also very violent towards women so if a woman is on screen she is either being viciously killed or being sexualized or just being Sharon Tate.\nI feel bad for the generation that sees Tarantino as one of the biggest names in cinema ( mine).", "One of Tarantino's Finest Works": "From the first frame of this film I could tell that I was in the hands of a filmmaker who has an insane amount of love and respect for their craft as well as the art form. This film has a very distinct tone and pace to it that is very different and unique for Tarantino. It's very reserved and mature, and I like that he's evolving as a filmmaker. His gimmicks and tropes are very held back to nonexistent in this film, and then he throws in something very special and satisfying towards the end for his fans. And despite the slow pace, the film managed to keep me invested and thoroughly entertained for the entire runtime. Which is entirely due to the fact that this film is more character driven than it is story/plot driven.This film plays out more like a loosely connected series of scenes rather than a flowing narrative. And despite the looser focus, the characters, themes, and motivations feel significantly more important and fleshed out compared to some of his other films. In fact I would go as far as to say that the main characters in this film are the most well written and fleshed out since Pulp Fiction. Scenes that some may consider pointless, I would not consider as such because they exist to flesh out the characters. This film is very respectful and laid back in its portrayal of Sharon Tate, which was refreshing after seeing the abomination that is The Haunting of Sharon Tate (2019). Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth have very compelling storylines and are the best characters Tarantino has made since Jules from Pulp Fiction. Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career in this film, and Leonardo DiCaprio was amazing as always. All the acting in this film from the main cast was Oscar worthy.The cinematography and set design of this film was emasculate. The glossy recreation of 1969 Hollywood was very impressive. I appreciated the authenticity and attention to detail of the sets. They went to great lengths to physically recreate Hollywood in 1969, filled to the brim with almost entirely practical effects, and very little digital recreation. The most impressive aspect of this is the abundance of long takes with Brad Pitt driving his car through the streets of 1969 Hollywood and yet the illusion of realism is never broken, and as he goes down every block it feels no less real than the last.As always with Tarantino, the film is very dialogue driven, which is as sparse, well written, and witty as always. The plot is loose, as stated before, and also simple, and yet is still unpredictable and suspenseful. The film relies on comedy more so than any other Tarantino film. Despite some ridiculous moments, the film has more to say than some of his recent films.The ending feels very much like Quentin Tarantino's style coming out. It was very satisfying for me and should satisfy most of his fans. I feel like it was very purposeful and surprisingly set up and fitting. This ending could make or break your experience, or you might think it's the only good part if you don't like slow burns. I found my jaw to be on the floor during the final scene, I was also laughing hysterically. The resolution to Rick Dalton's storyline was very clever commentary on heroism, how we perceive it, and how much violence we excuse in films by chalking it up to heroism. It was an impeccably set up and well constructed conclusion.Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite filmmakers and I'm always happy to see him expand, evolve, and take risks. I like that he found a way to do something new and meaningful rather than sticking to his same old shtick. I hope he is rewarded with a lot of Oscar recognition for this film (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor/Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Set Design, Best Score, Best Sound Design, all of it). This is one of my favorite Tarantino films and one of the best films I've seen so far this year.", "Horrible.": "The entire film has no much of a story.\nThere was nothing special about Pitt to be given any award.\nSuch a lengthy film (2 hrs 40 min) with nothing to offer.\nThe last 15 minutes were typical Tarrantino and probably the only part that had some writing.\nThe art direction was wonderful.\nDefinitely a waste of time.", "Tarantino touched me with this one": "I'm a Tarantino fan. Nothing special about that, but I have to admit I didn't enjoy 'The Hateful Eight' at all. That one was a letdown.But 'Once upon a time' is Tarantino at his best. Leo DiCaprio portrays an actor who has had his golden years, but in the end turns out to be a hero. Why? Because we, the audience, know the real story behind Sharon Tate and the Manson family and Tarantino's take which means leading it in another, fictional direction, makes Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth heroes for the public who recognise their influence on the Manson family and preventing the murders on Sharon Tate and her guests. That touched me. It moved me. It speaks to the subconcious that many people will share: the idea that horror can be prevented. Like the wish we could travel back in time and prevent something, because we know it will happen if we don't interfere.Having explored every detail in the Manson murders myself when I was in my twenties, made me quite emotional watching Sharon Tate surviving the Manson family without her realising what the horrible truth the real Sharon Tate had to face in real life.I think I would have liked more screentime for Steve McQueen and more other famous characters from the past, but this movie is the Tarantino one that is very enjoyable and both touching at the same time.I Always look for the Dutch elements in Tarantino movies.

But QT knows narrating movies.And he enjoyed every word of this script. Every dot and every letter. Writing them one by one. When I realized I was in front of a feel-good I am a movie maker movie type I just sat on the chair and enjoyed the master enjoying himself. This is not a movie anyone can enjoy.

I was really looking forward to see this film - the trailers were great, the reviews were excellent, and the film was... crap.The Tarantino genius seems to be entirely missing from this film. Did he even really write the script? No memorable scenes, the best dialogue is Brad Pitt talking to his dog. No amazing use of music - the oldies are thrown out one on top of another, as if to fill a soundtrack double CD, but never used to elevate the scene, which is what we loved in other Tarantino films (Django, Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs).Even worse - there is no storyline to follow, no point to the scenes. The violent ending has a bit of umph, but I am starting to suspect that Tarantino is focusing on buying real-estate, or doing something else with his time, and just threw this one together on a weekend to get a paycheck.And finally - the actors...\nThe only one that was reasonably good was Brad Pitt, who brought some personal attitude to his role and crammed that into the weak dialogue. Leonardo Di Caprio was colorless and boring to a scary degree. It seemed unplausible that he would be a TV-star at all, at any time. With the exeption of The Departed, Di Caprio has never seemed a very good actor, and bad actor + bad script = disaster.Margot Robbie had some \"Joy from My name is Earl\" charm to her, but all she really got to do was walk around and look to the front. Al Pacino brought Al Pacino to his utterly non-consequential scene and role (added in just to throw his name on the poster?).Somebody wrote that they would never have made this film if it wasn't Tarantinos creation, and boy is that a true statement. Even a producer's son would get a scolding from daddy if he wanted something like this greenlighted.Too long, no point, boring, no story and bad acting. I'm just glad I saw it on TV for free.", "Beautiful movie": "Such an amazing Movie made by Sir Tarintino just go watch it", "I can't believe I'm giving a QT movie 4/10": "Huge fan of Tarantino and eager to see this, we viewed it today. Something was missing from the beginning. If you are a fan, don't expect the brilliance and depth we find in most of his other. It seems that he had an idea and had to build the story that would lead up to that idea. What we got was a weak, lost story with very little substance. While the ending is superb and satisfying everything before it is a very loosely woven story. He must have owed Bruce Dern a part. But that scene is hollow and adds nothing to the story.I want to pick this movie apart act by act and scene by scene but I also want to avoid spoilers. The cast has many who appear frequently in his movies there are two or three excellent newbies. While Brad Pitt is the true lead and star (because he always is), Leonardo fails big time in over playing his role.But it is worthwhile watching all the way through. We almost walked out and are glad we did not.", "Tarantinos gentlest movie. 7.6": "Quentin made an indie film about an actor and his stuntman and an average couple days in 1960s Hollywood (that is until the end). Unlike Quentins other films there isn't many thrills, more vintage pleasantries. It's alot simpler and slower than you'd expect from the flashy movie poster BUT of course the attractive cinematography keeps you in. The lengthy one-shot scenes are talented- DiCaprio built an organic time-stamped character. I wouldn't go to the theaters to watch again BUT If I do watch it again it wouldn't be for entertainment but only to meditate on the easy LA times it portrays.", "It's not what I have expected at all!": "I didn't watch the trailer because I want to see it first hand on big screen. I walked into the cinema expecting to see a \"traditional\" QT film, I kept waiting and waiting for about 40 minutes, before realizing this is different (Yes, the last 30 minutes or so of towards the climax did capture the classic QT: plenty suspense, blood-shed and violence)I can see some fans be disappointed, since this film is no \"Kill Bill\", or \"Inglourious Basterds\". But, I am giving it 9/10 for two reasons:1) The acting is brilliant. Both Pitt and Leo gave an extremely convincing performance, true to their characters. Leo's delivery of a struggling aging star was some of the best I have seen on the big screen.2) This film is so diffident than today's CGI infested, action packed, cheap commercial cinema. It's a TRUE classic. It brings back what making film is all about - to submerge the audience into a real experience, deliver the background and atmosphere down to the finest details, making it so authentic and believable.I did feel the film was a tad too slow, and it wasn't aimed to build around a central story. But, it doesn't take away the brilliance. I give it a solid 9/10, despite being an action fan who'd love to see a classic QT movie.", "Really?": "\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2018 Is it me, or it's was a total S**t? I see some people are giving it a 10, but why is that?", "Outstanding. Can't wait to see it again": "I purposely tried not to watch or read anything about this film. I went into the theater just knowing I'm watching a QT movie and I expected it to follow the same formula as the others. It sure did. If you had never seen one of his films, you would have been bored to death, waiting for something to happen and trying to figure out if there is a plot. If you disliked Inglorious Bastards or Django Unchained or heaven forbid Pulp Fiction then don't go see this movie. Leonardo and Brad both deserve oscars.\nThe set designs were amazing. It really felt like Hollywood in 1969. Anyone that gives this a bad review is simply not a Tarantino fan. Fine with me. I know I am", "Some people don't seem to understand it...": "This is definitely a film made for fans of classic cinema and nostalgia. The scenery, the cars, the music, everything brings a special sort of feeling of Hollywood's Golden Age. There's a specific scene towards the end, a montage of various restaurants and businesses turning on their neon signs, that really captures that feeling. The Batman and Robin radio ad during the credits was a nice touch, especially as a fan of the Adam West TV show.All the actors do a superb job in this film, Leo is definitely Oscar bait for best actor.I'm reading a lot of negative reviews from Tarantino fans. They were expecting violence and gore throughout, a staple of Tarantino films. They didn't get that in this film. All the violence takes place the last 20 or so minutes. So I can understand why some would be upset by that. But it's the reason I like this film over other Tarantino films. It gave us a suspense. We all know what happened on August 8th, 1969. We were anticipating it. So when it came time, it was a nice payoff. I understand some others are upset because Tarantino tries to \"rewrite\" history by depicting the 2 lead characters (+ a cute pit bull) killing the 3 Manson Family members in a very gruesome and satisfying way. I understand the past still happened and the reality of the actual situation is sad and horrible to say the least. But I did feel a bit of poetic justice seeing the 3 family members taken down like that, and so did the rest of the audience who cheered during the whole scene. At the end of the day, this movie isn't for everyone. But for the people it is for, like myself, I was entertained beginning to end.", "Well that was different.": "But I absolutely loved it! It's not the usual Tarantino style, well not until the end, which I thought was brilliant.\nGreat role for Leo, and Cliff Booth..... well this could be Brad Pitt's finest character to date!Watch it! Just don't compare it , enjoy it for what it is.", "The best Tarantino movie ever": "I loved Pulp Fiction after the second watch only. Because of the vilolence I hated firts time. Then realized the genius of a very unique filmmaker.\nI'm now 25 years older, and once upon a time gave me the feeling of an old fashioned movie. Enjoyed every minutes. There is much less violence, thats also a good point. It's not for the crowd. (They need more blood I guess)\nThanks a million Quentin for this film!", "Love letter to the 1960s": "ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD is Tarantino's latest epic movie and thankfully much better than THE HATEFUL EIGHT. I find the director hit or miss in recent years, but this is his best since INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and one of his most satisfying creations. It's nothing less than his love letter to all things 1960s, and is a film chock-full of cultural references and an ensemble cast with a reliance on famous actors of yesteryear playing small roles. I particularly enjoyed the way Tarantino gets the opportunity to reference Italian genre cinema, a love of mine also. The plot is a real slow-burner and the middle section sags quite a bit, with endless scenes of DiCaprio shooting his scenes which add nothing to character or plot. However, Tarantino reins it in for the last hour and builds tension before letting rip with an incredibly violent and incredibly satisfying climax.", "Yaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwnn": "If you love historical movie stuff about Hollywood then you'll love it.\nIf not, you'll probably find it pretentious and incredibly boring, just like I did.", "LOVED IT": "I clapped at the end!!

Dull": "Completely aimless & criminally dull, Tarantino's (lack of) story gives a huge middle finger to the film's flawless production design & standout performances from Pitt, DiCaprio, & relative newcomer Julia Butters", "Revenge of the Big Face Part II": "Idea and execution rarely succeed at the same rate and after a day I've decided that this movie is better than the naysayers are naysaying it is. It is not going to jump out at you but it is a love letter not to the time but to the real victims who were murdered in real life. Think back to Inglorious Basterds: protagonista dies but she has the last laugh. Sharon Tate was field dressed in reel life; but not only does she survive in the film, her killers get the Tarantino treatment. I like the fact that Tate is shown genuinely enjoying her success. And yes there is the whole end of an era aspect with Brad and Leo, and they are both great. Tarantino is a sniper, not a grunt. Everyone knows that all of his movies get better with every viewing so I hope people take the time to consider all angles without letting their expectations get the better of them.", "Once Upon a Time .... ZZZZZZ": "What a boring movie. I do not even think that the word \"movie\" describes this project. There is a total lack of story - nothing that happens has anything to do with any semblance of plot. The scenes are chaotic and plug-and-play (no reason for it, just there) where there is no sense of continuity. The editing was just bad -beyond bad. The pacing was long and boring - it felt like you were sitting on your porch just watching traffic go bye and watching the neighbors interact. Every scene had a car scene afterwards - a long car scene that had nothing to do with the film - a long car scene where it just focused on the face of the driver and played old songs or old news clippings - nothing at all to do with anything-just filler and a waste of time and space.\nMaking Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee into caricatures was senseless - especially since it had nothing to do with the core project. One ridiculous moment after another - one idiotic moment followed by a car commercial.\nA terrible waste of time and space.", "\"Its official old buddy, Im a has been\"": "The landscape for the movie industry has changed drastically this past decade. Comic-book have took the cinemas like storm, star wars movies seemingly coming out once a year, and all of these are all owned by a single company. the industry just isn't the same as it was 30 years ago. A time where movies classic move sets Rather than visual effects. Or Banking on the \"Movie Star\" Rather than a Superhero. Well for a couple of hours, we are able to relive the glitz and glamour of 1960s hollywoodsI think it would be impossible to talk about Tarantinos latest realise without talking about him first. what I have always appreciated with Tarantino is the fact that he clearly makes what he wants to make. With so many Disney owned movies coming out per year which all seem to follow a very familiar formula, Its so unbelievably refreshing to see a film that docent seems like it is trying to please as big an audience as possible, and things are happening because the filmmaker wanted them in HIS film. There is a lot of time in this movie just spent absorbing the world that Tarantino and his team have brought to life. The production design here is nothing short of phenomenal, you can tell a lot of time and love has gone into bringing the 60s back to life, everything from cars, to billboards, to costume, all of this leads to a very authentic movie. As someone who wasn't around for the 60s, from what I have seen this film really does a good job of capturing the time period. Im glad that the movie spends so much time shining the spotlight on these aspects of the movie, because it is one of its strongest. Despite that, Just like with a lot of Tarantineos work, this movie can feel a little self indulgent, As much as I enjoy the scenes in this movie where we are being sucked deeper into this world, You will find yourself asking yourself \"Did we really need to see Brad Pitts character drive around for THAT long\". It may start to feel a little monotonous at times, however it's hard not to appreciate a film that isn't afraid to take its time with its characters and story.Speaking of story, This film follows Rick Dalton (Leonardo Di caprio) a faded tv actor who seems to be coming to the end of his career, and Cliff booth (Brad Pitt) Ricks stunt double and good friend, we follow both of them and there struggles in a world were the golden age of Hollywood is quickly coming to and end, Oh and Sharon Tate and the Mansons show up every now and then. Now I for one was looking forward to Di Vaprio and Brad Pitt finally being in a movie together, Its a pairing I didn't realise I needed until that first still was realised online. I am happy to report that they do not disappoint, Di caprio and Pitt are both great in this movie and there chemistry makes for some of the best scenes. Pitts character In particular gets some pretty juicy scenes, which I won't spoil here but lets just say that He gets a bunch of classic Tarantino material to work with which was just a blast to watch. Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate and is also given a lot of material in this movie, A scene where Sharon Tate attends a screening starring herself was a real highlight for me, Robbie did a fantastic job communicating Tates Happy spirit and Optimism and it is just so infectious that its hard not to love. With that said, Her inclusion in the film does not feel completely necessary to the overall plot, As in you could literally remove her from the film entirely and I don't think a thing would have to change, however I can't say that her inclusion was detriment to the film and she added a lair of innocence to Hollywood compared to our more seasoned main characters which for me was a nice welcome.Overall I would rank this pretty High up in Tarantinos overall Filmography. It may not be as good as Pulp fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but this Film is going for something much different to anything that he has done before, This is one of Tarantinos most sincere movies. Don't go in expecting to see a Kill Bill or Django Unchained. This is a love letter to not just a time period, but a time in Hollywood that just does not exist anymore.", "A fairytale that I wish really happened.": "I was too young to understand the Sharon Tate murder when it happened, but the repercussions of that event haunted my childhood. It was such a dark stain that really changed how America viewed itself and officially signaled the end of the 60's (along with Altamont Speedway). It was an evil act, done by evil people, for evil reasons and it lightened my soul to see a world where those heinous acts were never allowed to happen.", "Not a film, but narrative that didn't go anywhere": "Not story, no point - really. Don't waste money at the cinema, wait for free streaming if you must see it.I love QT's films but this wasnt a film, it was just a continuous collection of set pieces but with no point, no plot and no finish.LDC overacted, but Brad Pitt, he was very good. His best acting to date, so that was one plus.", "Love Tarantino - disappointing movie": "Husband and I love Tarantino and were very excited to see this film. After the first 20 minutes or so, we became so bored that we contemplated leaving the theater. We didn't, and stayed for the whole thing, but the only truly interesting and exciting part was the last half hour or so. Very disappointed.", "Tarantino's tribute to Hollywood in a real-life/fiction hybrid": "Tarantino's 9th (last-but-one, he proclaims) feature film is the lightest in the violence department. It is a fond tribute, one could say, of the auteur to his beloved Hollywood. The 160 minutes run time many consider to be too long but that arguably is just a matter of personal preference. It structures along three parallel story lines which, as mentioned, constitutes a hybrid of real-life and fictional.The fiction can legitimately be called a buddy story. While many comparisons have been offered by critics, from Don Quixote/ Sancho to Butch Cassidy/Sundance Kid, the most obvious one nobody mentioned, perhaps because it was too recent. I am talking about \"Green Book\". Obviously, there are more differences than similarities but let me just focus on the latter. Here we have Rick the past-prime but not yet over-the-hill movie star (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his long-time stunt double Cliff (Brad Pitt). The most obvious similarity to \"Green Book\" is that Cliff is temporary chauffer to Rick, although for a different reason (Rick got his license suspended for drunk driving). There is the similar class gap, essentially money and social status. In terms of temperament, Rick is emotionally fragile while Cliff is all cool common sense.Before I elaborate further on this fictional plotline, let me also mention the real-life story: Rick's Hollywood neighbor, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). This right away casts a dark shadow on what would have been a purely fun-filled movie. Her brutal murder by the diabolic Manson gang has left such a horrific scar in Hollywood that even 50 years has not quite completely healed. I won't go into how this devastating atrocity is addressed in the movie. I may, later, but not without an additional spoiler warning.The bulk of the story happens in a weekend, or the first two hours of screen time. The last half-hour, \"six-months later\", approaches the fateful date of the Manson murder.Cliff's place in Rick's life is, as described in a voice over, \"more than a brother but less than a wife\". In the movie, while we see them often together in the car, they have two separate trajectories.Rick struggles with self-doubt during filming of a western in which he is cast as the villain. This project turns out to be a blessing, restoring his confidence in a large measure, particularly when a super-cool-matured 8-year-old girl, after their scene together, praises him: \"this is the best acting I have ever seen\". This movie-in-a-movie, by the way, can be seen as an entertaining subplot, with a classic gun fight, as well as a cliff-hanging moment when Rick's character threatens to kill the 8-year-old girl he kidnapped for ransom. Anyway, this movie opens the door for Rick to make four spaghetti westerns in Italy. Six months later he is at a crossroad of his career, coming home with modest success, as well as an Italian wife. One good thing that comes to an end though is his long partnership with Cliff. The two buddies plan to give this treasured relationship a memorable ending by going to a pub and getting drunk together.Cliff's trajectory takes on a different route. Except for chauffeuring Rick, hanging out occasionally with him during his busy filming schedule and doing odd jobs for him (such as fixing the antenna in his house) Cliff has plenty of time to kill. Although he wouldn't mind spending all this time talking to his dog, which listens patiently, it's not entirely satisfying, as the dog cannot talk back. Cliff therefore drives around and ends up hooking up with pretty Pussycat, who expectedly tries to seduce him in the car, while he is driving. Rick is ultra-cautious and refuses unless she can provide solid proof that she is over 18, which she cannot. Through this, Rick intimates that he once had a close brush with the law and does not intend to push his luck. From another source, we understand that he might have murdered his wife. But his shady past is always shrouded in mystery.It is logical therefore that the most high-tensioned, suspenseful sequence comes with Cliff's arc, an encounter with the Manson gang. Pussycat is a member of the Manson \"family' at Spahn Ranch, a hippie community, mainly of young women plus a couple of young men. One exception is an old man George Spahn (Bruce Dern), the owner whom Rick knew 8 years back before the filming location was abandoned and acquired by Manson. The tension keeps building when Cliff, brought to the Ranch as a friend and guest by Pussycat, keeps pressing for the whereabouts of George. While the outcome is anticlimactic, the journey of Tarantino's deft suspense is well worth the trip, particularly with Pitt's superb minimalistic performance.With Sharon Tate's real-life story, the irony is that Tarantino had Robbie portray her as a dreamy fairytale figure that just might live happily ever after. Her husband Roman Polanski appears only briefly in the first segment and is overseas in the final half-hour segment. Sharon goes about her life almost like floating with an airy lightness, partying, shopping and watching by herself a comedy in which she has a minor role. In the \"six months later\" segment, she is very pregnant and, with Polanski away, entertaining four friends at home. While most in the audience were probably not yet born on that fateful day, they would know, even if vaguely, that August 9, 1969 was when the five people were brutally murdered by the Manson gang (Manson himself was not there) in Sharon's home.So, there you have it: 3 protagonists (2 fictional, 1 real-life), 3.5 story lines (including the movie-in-movie), 2 segments comprising February 1969 (first 2 hours) and August 1969 (last half-hour).Big spoiler warning.By the time the second segment starts, most in the audience would be holding their breath, even subconsciously, with ominous foreboding. The way Tarantino handles the devastating true event is a master stroke, especially the final shot.After the aforementioned farewell drinking spree, Cliff (together with his dog) comes to stay over at Rick's house. Rick's Italian wife is living there already. The Manson gang, fitted out with gun and knives, has been sent to the neighborhood to kill some rich people. The noise of their car engine really annoys Rick who comes out to his front driveway, yells at them and chases them away. In the meantime, Sharon next doors is having a great time with her 4 friends. On-screen texts keep updating the time, masterfully creating creepy foreshadowing. Tarantino keeps the audience believing that the Manson gang, coming back after a brief retreat, will be going into the Polanski house, in a movie recreation of the murder. But instead, they go into Rick's house where Cliff, probably at one time a killer deadlier than any of them, gives them a hell of a gory time, assisted by his dog. Rick and his Italian wife have their share of the fun too. This scene is vintage Tarantino. Fans who have been disappointed so far will likely find what they have been missing.And here comes the master stroke. When the dust settles and police arrives, the gang members are all dead. Rick is taken into an ambulance, injured but not fatally. One of Sharon's guests comes out to see what caused the commotion. Rick explains everything to him. At Sharon's invitation for a drink (over the intercom), Rick comes through the Polanski house's main gate while Sharon comes out with the other guests to greet him. The last shot is a crane shot (playing God?) showing the cordial greetings of these new friends before they go into the house. We are left wondering if, for the movie, the murder as in real-life is going to happen in the next day or two. Or, as an alternative to the open-end, the bloodbath has been substituted with what just happened in Rick's house. In this alternate time line, the world never lost this endearing, child-like Hollywood rising star.End of spoilerThe three leads are all wonderful, each in their own way. The support cast is also something to behold. In addition to abovementioned Bruce Dern, there are Al Pacino, Kurt Russell and Timothy Olyphant portraying, respectively, movie tycoon, director and lead actor that interact with Rick. Dakota Fanning plays a leading member in the Manson \"family\" at Spahn Ranch. On that sequence, abovementioned Pussycat is played by Margaret Qualley. While not exactly a household name, she is familiar to those who have enjoyed the excellent TV series of \"The leftovers\", as one of the key members of that exquisite ensemble cast. Compared with that powerful TV series, the character Pussycat in this movie is easy work for her, but not entirely unchallenging. Incidentally, this being a Tarantino movie, his signature shot takes advantage of her shapely bare feet, resting comfortably on the dashboard while Rick is driving her around town. Early in the movie, two iconic Hollywood figures are portrayed with good resemblance, Mike Moh as Bruce Lee and Damian Lewis and Steve McQueen.", "What a load of nothing": "Unbelievably boring and mundane movie apart from last 10 minutes.

The name of the movie really makes sense as you walk out of the theatre. The writing is superb and even when you think you've figured it out and know what's going to happen it switches on you. One of Tarantino's best, if not his best movie of all time. For sure one of the best performances I've seen from Leo, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie in their careers.

By now at the latest, you know that permanent self-reference is not enough for a story and even the fact that good actors are at work is not satisfying if the script and dialogue are not coherent. Until the last 15 minutes are somehow interesting, firstly because Tarantino leads us around by the nose with the well-known Manson story, and secondly because everything is just right here. Until then, however, little is right, even the fact that Brad Pitt got an Oscar is a bad joke for me, in keeping with almost all the jokes in the film.

Lenoardo dicaprio control his tone of line so perfectly that drew into u, Brad pitt make the whole thing so intense even without lines and Margot Robbie suit perfectly with the role she playing.

Everyone wish how its will be nice if this is the ending. But somehow I not happy with the way it's protray Bruce Lee, find it racist that u should make a research first before u want to have a martial arts icon inside your movie.", "Very dissapointing": "Too much foul language for my liking, and the story wasn't up to much either", "Like a Roughcut": "Couldn't stand this film. It was like watching a roughcut. So many pointless long scenes with music and no meaning.", "CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10)": "The stage curtains open ...Quentin Tarantino gives us another twisted tale as only he can imagine it. This time, he uses the backdrop of Hollywood circa 1969 and, very loosely, surrounding the circumstances of Sharon Tate's murder by members of the Manson Family. Some have toted this as a film with no definitive plot, but I disagree. There is definitely a plot here with an ending you will not see coming.Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a former television star from an old 50's western known as \"Bounty Law\", finds himself at the tail end of his viable career. It's 1969, and the best role he can find anymore is the thankless role of the \"heavy\", whereupon he is defeated in episode after episode. He is chauffeured around town by his stunt man double, and friend, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Right next door to him, lives Roman Polanski and his beautiful actress wife, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). While Dalton struggles with the realization that his acting career may be over, Cliff has a run-in with the Manson Family which will eventually lead to the film's eye popping finish.This is good film making. Tarantino is a master at his craft. Going in, I was hoping for and expecting a twisted end. But as the film progressed, I began to fear that it may be more about the journey than the end destination. Not that I was complaining, because the journey is a lot of fun. Thankfully, I was treated to a great ending - one I didn't see coming. In fact, the build up was done so well, that when Tarantino's twist came in, I found myself grinning shamelessly from ear to ear.I highly recommend \"Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood\". This isn't what I would call one of Tarantino's best films, but it may be one of his most unexpected (in a good way). The acting was excellent, the cinematography very well done, and the special effects pertinent to the overall story. I loved this film and will watch it again. A very strong 8 stars out of 10.", "Just live in the movie": "My friend and I are massive Tarantino fans. It's the World he creates and whether anything that happens has a direct impact to the story or not, we just love it. The dialogue and screenplay is just phenomenal in this movie. It has that hint of redemption which delivers a plot that you need, not what you want. Especially in all this superhero era of movies, we just loved living in Tarantino's world for a few hours, listening to it. Every tiny detail was there and sadly, most of the folks here don't seem to understand or even notice any of it! That's a shame, because it is an amazing film.", "Stellar Writing Is What Made This Movie So Good": "Well, Quentin Tarantino is at it again and has now graced his fans with his ninth directorial effort (if you're not including Death Proof). This time around, taking a step back from his usual tendencies in a way, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood actually felt like a breath of fresh air to me, and that's coming from someone who absolutely enjoys the violence he presents throughout his films. This movie is worth your time if you're a fan and also for those who are turned off by the excessive violence. Here's why I believe this film may reach a broader audience than most of his works.Almost completely devoid of a story at all, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood follows Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fading Hollywood star, and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as his stunt double who no longer receives any work. Throughout a series of events and the introduction of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), this is a film that disobeys every rule that most films follow, making for a highly enjoyable experience. To really dive into details would be to ruin where the movie ends up, so the best way to describe this movie is to say that it consists of a lot of great scenes of people talking, which eventually slowly builds to a climax that you may or may not expect.Now, where I feel this film may be for more viewers than most Tarantino flicks is in the fact that the majority of this 161-minute feature doesn't have a lot of violence. It really did feel like Tarantino was trying to go for a more subdued film as a whole, which will please some viewers. With that said, there are absolutely some brutal moments that don't hold back, but they are few and far between enough to not have queasy audience members wanting to walk out of the theatre.As always, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood's very best aspect is the screenplay itself. Yes, Tarantino always works with a talented crew in order to make his films look fantastic, but the dialogue spoken by the characters in this film just felt so authentic. At nearly three hours, this is a movie that doesn't feel like it drags, simply due to the fact that these actors are bringing their A-Game as always and the screenplay they're working with is top-notch. Every performance here deserves some recognition, but I also believe the script has something to do with that.In the end, if I had to nitpick about anything, I would say that the lack of overall storytelling may hinder the film for people, and even though I was questioning where the film was going, I was always won over by everything else. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is simply one of the best movies I've had the chance to see so far in 2019 and I will continue to say that until the year's end. With stellar performances all around, phenomenal writing/directing, a visual style that feels different than most movies that will come out this year, and a pace that never feels too slow, given the slow nature of the movie, I can't really find many things to complain about. This film is fantastic.", "A Fantastic Exercise2 Make Great Actors Better!": "Really great flick. Writing was on point and the acting was above and beyond. Had me wondering if it would of been better if the 2 main actors had switched roles.Seems to be a lot of the film cut out as well.Also a lot of driving, more than I can remember in any film in a while.Nobody does a fight scene like Quentin.", "Terrible Movie": "This was a waste of 3 hours. Absolutely NO PLOT. Boring, meaningless scenes, one after another. Brad Pitt sheep probably love this movie, he can't act.", "A Signature Tarantino Classic": "It's so good it feels like two separate movies! After you watch it you'll remember an amazingly hilarious or stunning scene from the first act and just say \"Wow, that was the same flick?\"\nThe cast was absolute dynamite. Led by the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie- all three were simply electric on screen with their costars. The characters they portay, particularly DiCaprio and Pitt, were superbly likable. It was hard not to cheer at their triumphs, and not to stand in anxiety at their troubles. This movie is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish, drink in every detail; there is only 1 more Tarantino movie to go.", "SO FUN AND EXCITING": "I love this movie from the charachter development to jump off your seats action its great.\nEvery single actor in this movie was brilliant every single one.\nThis movie was fun,exciting and overall another brilliant movie from Quentin Tarantino who deserves all the respect he gets and I hope nothing but the best for him and expect nothing but the best movies from him", "A whole lot of nothing": "Barely anything happens...

The pacing is slow, but it also builds the story minute by minute.. There's sparse action, but it isn't meant to be an action movie.\nIs it pretentious?\nI dont think so, Tarantino knows his craft and he poured everything he had into this one. He didnt do this for the sake of being artsy fartsy about it. Everything matters in this film, even the minute details that might seem like they were just thrown in.This is the kind of film in which every little movement of the camera has intention and meaning behind it.\nIt might be slow, it might be like a slice of life rather than a high octane action/drama, but it has those moments too. It presents the audience with every emotion under the sun to feel.\nIf you watch it expecting kill bill, youre not going to get that. Its a paced, measured and deliberate love letter to the golden age of hollywood.After seeing this film it became my favourite film of all time immediately.Now, i tried to watch this with my girlfriend today. She didnt take to it the way i did. We got about an hour in and she fell asleep.\nTake from that what you want.I still think this is a 10/10 film.", "150 mins of boring and 15 mins of OTT violence": "I have enjoyed most Tarantino films but this one was just god awful. By the time you kind of realise that 'Charlie' is actually Charles Manson you think that maybe it will get interesting. But no it's just 2 and a half hours of boring nothingness, that ends with some ridiculously over the top (even for Tarantino) violence with no real explanation.After reading an explanation online it appears that you needed to be fully aware of the events of the 8th August 1969 to appreciate what the film is trying to say.Also if it's supposed to be taking the limelight from Manson and create this fairytale ending then why not skip making the film? At the end of the day Tarantino has still profited off of Manson's actions and Sharon Tate's Murder.", "More than a love letter to hollywood.": "Yes it's true. This film is a love letter to hollywood and all it stood for, but it's more than that. It is set in 1969, wich is the beginning of the end of the golden era of hollywood ( and the hippie era). The Manson murders ar the reason for that. This sixties is filled with hapiness and hope for the future. This is best shown in the character of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Every seen with her is lovely and filled with joy. What makes it at the same time sad to watch because of what happens to her.I suggest that whoever wants to watch this movie should educate themselves about the manson murders. It really makes the experience of the movie better. Every scene gets more meaning. I think the fact that people don't know what happended is the biggest reason why people misunderstand this movie.The other character Rick Dalton ( Leonardo dicaprio) is an actor who sees the industry around him change and he has to change with it in order to survive in the industry. This is QT reflecting on himself as a director. The industry is changing ( endless sequels and the ever-growing MCU) and Tarrantino thinks of himself as an old hound. This is QT most selfreflecting movie.At the base there is a lot of classic Tarrantino to, references to, other movies, violence, realistic dialogues, cool characters ( ex. Brad Pitt)The title is a reference to a spaggethiwestern ( once upon a time in the west) because Rick Dalton plays in spaghettiwestern.\nOnce upon a time is also the beginning of a fairy tail. And this movie is a modern fairy tail.Tarrinto takes us on a ride trough the hollywood he knew and gives Sharon Tate the ending she deserves.", "Amazing...": "Outstanding acting, outstanding cinematography, outstanding film. By far the best movie I have seen this year. Thank you so much I am definitely going to watch it again", "NOT a movie for children, and by that I mean anyone born before 1969.": "OK, so most movie goers feel someone 50 years of age is ancient, and anyone older couldn't possibly find their way to the nearest movie theater, much less stay awake for over two hours in the dark.\nI fully understand many of the posts that complain \"the plot went nowhere-- nothing happens\" if you weren't around when Ike was president, Kennedy was shot, TV screens were all black and white and every family watched what was on together because there were only 2 channels. There was \"Tuesday or Friday night At the Movies\" so we gray hairs have seen Steve McQueen weekly on Wanted,Dead or Alive (Bounty law) or in The Great Escape (the movie role Dalton lost) or Nevada Smith (Nebraska Jim) multiple times.\nSpagetti western references- ahhh ... Clint- who became famous as Rowdy Yates in the 1950's TV western \"Rawhide\".\nDid you folks pick up on Dalton and Booth banter \"Maybe we'll go to Delgato's and drink some Mezcal\"?\nAh \"HOMBRE!\" You put ze hole in me!\nBut- don't focus on Paul Newman--\nWho was the Bad Guy... the guy who was once a TV western hero known as Paladin in \"Have Gun, Will Travel?\" and subsequently found himself being constantly cast as the villain (Big Jake, the Shootist, Winter Kills,etc)... Richard Boone. Sounds a lot like Booth doesn't it?\nAnd what was Dalton's agent's chief complaint-- too many bad guy parts...\nSo- If you're over 60, do yourself a favor and go see this Tarantino masterpiece.\nThere are priceless pearls dropped before swine in every scene that the youngsters can't possibly recognise or relate to, but will touch your heart immediately.Don't read this last paragraph spoiler if you haven't seen the movie yet:What's with the rambling plot?\nSo...You're Quentin Tarantino, a complete movie geek, and late one night, you realize the 50th anniversary of the Sharon tate murder is fast approaching and you wonder, what if these three hippie low-lifes mistakenly first walked into Steve McQueen/Clint Eastwood/Richard Boone's pad by mistake?\nTarantino's genius is introducing his young audience to Sharon and these men in a fabulously entertaining suspenseful way. If only Hollywood could corrrect more of the mayhem that was the 60's...\nAnd put on that old Paul Revere and the Raiders album once more before you go.", "Great art": "Honestly speaking I love Brad performance too. Leo is extraordinary. Al, Luke among everyone else are amazing.\nImpeccable movie.\nClimax is undeniably seamless.", "Feels like 1969!": "Great characters showcasing what might have been! Only if...", "Unique experience.": "Never expected such a feel good movie from Tarantino.\nDiCaprio and Pitt indeed performed their best.\nClimax was high octane. Brandy the dog, was such a darling.\n10/10", "\"I just kept waiting and waiting to not be a philistine\"": "This film is 'high art.' There aren't many directors willing to walk down this lane, but because Tarantino is a master of his craft, he does so elegantly.", "2 stars cause the ending was good": "I love QT, but I'm sorry, I get it's intent and it's art and I'm an older man so I understood all the references, but this movie bored the heck out of me. I sat there and watched and watched and waited. Pacino was good, Margot dancing was probably some of the best scenes, and the crazy ending. Either than that, it wasn't anything special.", "AMAZING movie - another Tarantino masterpiece": "Ok, full disclosure - I'm a huge QT fan, and have seen everything he's ever directed or produced.This movie is one of his absolute BEST, hands down. It rivals Pulp Fiction in my opinion. I really love the way Tarantino takes occasional liberties with actual history (like in Inglorious Basterds, where Hitler met a different fate than suicide in a bunker). The little girl in this movie is a genius - just watch her career take off. Dakota Fanning had a similar meteoric rise, and she's even in this movie as well. The cast is incredible - the cinematography and performances are insane. I'm going to the theater again this weekend to watch it a second time.", "Great, But Not For Everyone": "Something about this movie makes me think that it will age very well, kind of like Fight Club. I saw it twice, and both times I absolutely loved it. There is something special about this, and it ranks pretty well among my favourite Tarantino films. It definitely isn't a Pulp FIction or an Inglorious Basterds, but something about this movie is just so appealing to me, I can't get enough of it. I would probably rate this as my favourite movie of the year. Saying all of this, I am a huge fan of Tarantino, so it could just be a byas, but I think everyone should give it a watch and see what they think", "BEAUTIFUL MOVIE.": "Simpletons should avoid this movie. Like a few of the folks giving it poor reviews on here. This is a masterpiece in cinema and acting. FACT!! Leonardo can act like f*~k. Beautiful movie. Nuff said. If you didn't enjoy it then you're an idiot. True story.", "I USUALLY LOVE TARANTINO BUT I HATE THIS MOVIE": "If you want to know what was wrong with the new flick by your all time favorite edgy filmmaker Tarantino you should read the 1 star reviews.But there are positive things to say: dicaprio acted fantastic. The set and the costumes were excellent. The climatic scene was entertaining. That's it.The rest was terrible pacing, stupid flashbacks, boring dialogue, unnecessary scenes and characters and it was really long and you are patiently waiting for the story to really start. And then it's over.My conclusion is that the movie was just irrelevant. I've seen worse flicks this year including endgame. So make your own mind", "Very cleverly done, well done Mr T! (spoilers)": "As most reviews stated its not a typical Tarantino. While watching i didn't know the real back story at all, which does leave you confused. I had to go home after and read what actually happened. and the more i think about it the better the film gets. Giving an alternate ending to a real life gory horror was Tarantino's ultimate twist. the real story is the horror and he changed it. For people that want to analyse i film and its director you can go into quite some depth here.The acting was superb, Pitt and Dicaprio did an amazing job, though slow in places they set off the characters perfectly. It shows the era fantastically and its all been followed through very well.Don't see this just to see the the latest Tarantino film, see it in its own right.", "Hollywood loving slow burner": "Brad Pitt's easy swag at once aligns and contrasts with his sharp stunt scenes. The movie's pace matched his easy swag.Having lived in the LA area, felt connected to the movie to be able to relate to city names and street names referenced. Clearly, lot of love and detailing has gone into capturing the sixties. I can imagine the nostalgia that the movie can evoke in the audience of that generation.The movie has it's own unique style and character. You can feel the mastery as the movie draws you in coolly and surely.Dicaprio has done some scenes pretty well. But I enjoyed watching Brad Pitt much more than I enjoyed Di Caprio's character. All of Brad's scenes worked while some of Dicaprio's did not. Margot Robbie has played her part nicely as well.Violence is usually exaggerated in Tarantino movies. This one felt a bit less so. Stark, gory, stylish but not obviously over-exaggerated.Story line is very interesting in the sense that the movie does not capitalize on the actual event that the movie is based on, but instead just leads you there. It is a bit of a mysterious movie, charming as well. Must watch if you are a Tarantino fan, though quite unlike his other movies.", "Gone over a few people's heads": "Not a huge fan of all Tarantino's film but this one I enjoyed. Brad Pitts character is definitely the most entertaining , but Leonardo's is a well played character who I found likeable as the struggling actor . Margot Robbie put in a good turn with her performance too as the young actress.\nI do think this film goes over alot of people's heads as you'll see in some of the review .\nIf you are after non stop action it's not that kind of film but when you do get it it's definitely worth the wait . Brad Pitts end scene had me on stitches .\nYes at times it's a slow burner , but good things come to those that wait...", "Remember. Tarantino WRITES.": "The direction he's been going in has reached his screenplay masterpiece. Spare and unsympathetic in many places, this out - dogs Reservoir Dogs.\nIt's been cited as a \"Love letter to Hollywood\". No. This is more a blackmail note. His hostage is cinema and the future, the threat.\nIs he big enough to mark a place in history by telling a convoluted Western tale against the reality of business manipulation?\nYes. But only if you've lived a sizeable chunk of his story yourself.\nAnd if you care.", "A contrived story without a narrative core.": "In a year of generally mediocre films it is not difficult to stand out, especially if your name is Quentin Tarantino. Whether the critical acclaim heaped on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) is warranted or not depends on your taste for films without a narrative core that ooze melodramatic nostalgia and blur the transient realities of watching movies about making movies.The plotline unfolds in slow motion and when it finally does, it is largely inconsequential. The story is based around the declining career of a 1950s B-grade Western actor called Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) whose last chance is to capitalise on the popularity of 'spaghetti westerns'. His alter ego and long-time double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is the real thing: a war veteran and martial arts expert whose role in life is to make Rick believe in himself, despite the truth. Within this loose cinematic frame, the film meanders from skit to skit without the connective tissue that makes for purposeful or coherent storytelling. It builds a two and a half hour filmic scaffold that culminates in ten gruesome minutes loosely based on the Charles Manson-inspired murder of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).The only lingering after-effect of seeing this film is to question why it was made at all. Neither of the buddy stars are likeable people: Rick is self-serving, weak and shallow, and Cliff doubles up on these qualities and adds a taste for violence. Their acting is understandably old-school and contrived. Sharon is paraded as the film's visual centrepiece, a role she fills remarkably well despite being given a script that renders her practically dumb. The relationship between the buddies, the Manson cult, and the murders is non-existent other than to imply that nothing needs to make sense if it is linked to Hollywood.The sole redeeming feature of this film is its forensic attention to reproducing the sets, fashion, styles, and social mores of the 1960s. The archival television and movie footage recreate the ambience and ambivalence of the cultural upheaval that we now refer to as the 'golden era' or 'heyday' of film and television. While this will appeal to many, others will be distracted by the film's fractured storyline and its contrived vignettes of the past.\nBlending history, fantasy, and entertainment is Tarantino's ultimate purpose. His message is simple: the fairy tale of Hollywood is and has always been a chimera.", "Best film ever": "The best film ever!! Stay focus at the movie and you will understand!", "A one pony show whose ending stifles the whole movie": "The problem with this movie id that out is obvious the ending was created first and then the movie built around it. This completely destroys the first two hours and, well, nothing happens at all. I loved pulp fiction as each movie was almost could have been a separate movie they were so good. In this OUTH scenes are muted trying to save the big ending splash. The ranch scene is a classic example here. This is the first QT movie I would call boring and to an extent unworthy of QT.", "Tarantino's best film.": "This film is really beautiful. The acting is wonderful. Everything about the film works.", "Original, but overly self-indulgent and meandering.": "I love the fact that Tarantino jumps from genre to genre and is happy to break the rules: have the narrator just jump in when he fells like it, include scenes that don't move the plot forward etc. if you can do it and make it work, then do it. Unfortunately, for me anyway, it doesn't really work.There are some cool scenes, a bit of humor with the dog, a bit of extreme violence, cool references to old movies, a good soundtrack; but the movie as a whole was too long and slightly boring. The references to the sixties in particular started to feel very self indulgent and they were just coming way too thick and fast for my liking. Another sign of the self-indulgence were the credits which included a bunch of actors as \"the gang\" and Tim Roth's inclusion in the credits, despite not appearing in the film (his scene was cut).To echo what others have pointed out, if this film was by an unknown with little know actors people probably wouldn't finish watching it and no-one would be calling it a masterpiece.", "Superior": "Loved this movie - so very entertaining! Loved seeing Dicaprio and Pitt together! Laughed so very much! So happy the way Tarantino changed the ending of the Tate murders -at that one moment went they were getting the crap beat out of them - you felt a little revenge for the evil that had really happened! Love all Tarantino movies -he is brilliant!!", "Tarantino's Best Since 'Kill Bill'": "I cannot think of a bad performance in this loving tribute to 1960's movies and Hollywood. You don't feel like you are watching a film ABOUT the 60s, you feel like you are watching a film IN the 60s with the exception of language. The only casting issue I had was with Margot Robbie who, while quite pretty, is no Sharon Tate who was astoundingly beautiful and was defined by her loveliness. With the exception of Kurt Russell and Bruce Dern, the supporting cast were so deep into their characters that they were almost recognizable. I found only two sections of the film where editing needed to tighten up the film's pace, but those two sections were definitely dragging. If Tarantino can continue with films like this then I hope his rumored retirement is far, far away.", "A Slow Roll Into an Intense Third Act": "Tarantino's 9th film brings an ensemble cast back to the end of the 1960s in the months preceding the Manson Family murder of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and her friends. He pairs this background plot point with the story of Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a \"has-been\" actor trying to find his way in a changing Hollywood and his loyal companion, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), his stunt double. Most of the movie serves as an homage to the 1960s era of film and TV while building our main characters, Rick, Cliff, and to a lesser extent, Sharon. The film spends its first two acts pretty tame by Tarantino's standards, highlighting Dalton's character and struggle with his changing surroundings more than anything else. The first really tense scene of the movie involves Cliff giving one of Manson's family members a ride home. The scene builds a tension reminiscent of Tarantino's earlier films, particularly some of the great scenes of tension in Inglorious Basterds. The first two acts amount to an incredibly slow buildup culminating in a huge payoff when Tarantino spins history to have the Manson family attack Dalton's home. What follows is an incredibly cathartic, yet violent, set piece with huge payoffs for Chekov's guns laid out earlier in the film. If you can make it through the slow character buildup of the first two acts, you'll be rewarded with an intense third act which brings a huge sense of catharsis and satisfaction. Personally, it was worth it. If you love Tarantino, it's a no-brainer to see this movie.", "Brilliant Tarantino perfection! And for those who don't get it, think Manson murders, and...": "...read 'Jimmy_the_Gent4' review - the relation to the Manson murders and this film, and I promise you, you will love this film even more!

Exceptional attention to details in the dated sets, costumes and props. Directing. Cinematography.

Now I am a huge Tarantino fan and assumed that the movie just had another \"Reservoir Dogs\", \"Pulp Fiction\", \"The Hateful Eight\", \"Django Unchained\" or \"Inglorious Basterds\" ending and that that might've been what they disliked. After having watched it I can confidently say that the whole movie is amazing, I couldn't find a thing I disliked: Phenomenal acting, phenomenal writing, phenomenal set design, phenomenal costume design, phenomenal cinematography, phenomenal editing, phenomenal sfx and vfx and just phenomenal EVERYTHING. And the ending of course didn't disappoint either, it was a very entertaining and well executed\nThe film is so incredibly detailed and you can really tell that everyone involved put so much care and effort into it that it just fills you with happiness! I absolutely recommend this movie, for me it is just as entertaining as the other movies in Tarantino's magnificent lineup.", "That's what movies are made for": "I love Tarantino's movies, but this one seems to take a special place in my heart. You know that feeling when you leave the theater and think thanks god I was born in movie era. That's exactly how I felt. It was beautifully shot. Script was incredible and even heartwarming. I loved how happily it ended, that in the end good won. Knowing the story, how terrible it was in real life, this movie has even bigger and more beautiful meaning, that at least in our imagination Sharon and her friends stayed alive. I wonder what Polanski thinks of this movie. Other than saving Sharon and her friends, movie was also about friendship and movie industry. It showed us what it's like behind the mask of a star. How frustrating and miserable actors might be from role to role. I loved the dynamic between Leo's character and the little girl. Whole movie seemed so realistic and yet so magical that this can only happpen in a film. Everyone was icnredible in their roles but I guess Leo and Margaret just nailed the role. Leo was superfantastic, in every mimic and move he expressed everything. In the end I have to admit, one of the reasons I love Tarantino's movies is that characters are such badasses. They do even the hardest things with so much fun and coolness that you cheer for them.", "A mishmash of nothing": "I kept hoping as i watched this for a turn around at some point, but at the 2 hour point i got tired of waiting, and stopped it on my dvd. It was obvious a love affair of QT'S NOSTOLGIC love of the late 50's amd 60's. So was I, up to a point...but i couldn't take it anymore. I was waiting to see why Brad Pitt won an oscar for his role. i was waiting and there was absolutely nothing shown by his acting that deserved the award. He was just Brad Pitt.

That's where \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" belongs. It's okay. There's not much else to say. Leonardo DiCaprio works hard but to no end. Brad Pitt is on cruise control. Margot Robbie is reduced to just a pretty face. It's Quentin Tarantino's bridge to nowhere. When people discuss QT's films \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" won't be mentioned often.

I watched many episodes of the show \"Most Evil\" where an expert assigns serial killer an \"evil rating\" based on a specific set of criteria. I'm sure at some point he analyzed Manson. I've seen many episodes of Criminal Minds and all the episodes of Mind Hunter. I guess you could say I had a morbid curiosity. I always felt safe and secure as though there was a protective shield between me and the content I was watching.Then my mom recommended we watch \"Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.\" Now I'm an (early) 90s baby but I love the 60s. Both of my parents are boomers. I certainly knew about Charles Manson and what he had done.I watched the film with a mild sense of dread because I honestly thought it was going to show the brutal killings of Tate and the other victims-Voytek Frykowski, Steven Parent, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. To be clear this is not a full list of all the Manson victims but just the most famous ones who were murdered on the nights of August 8-9th 1969. I assumed that was to be the climactic end to the film. I just couldn't bear to see it. Tarantino movies are so long; the longer I watched the more I became absorbed and attached to the victims. Everything inside of me was consumed with dread. I felt so very attached to Tate in particular. Perhaps because of Tate's quintessential vulnerable nature- a petite beautiful soft spoken actress 8 and a half months pregnant.This film left me shaken to my core because of what my imagination did. I desperately wanted to believe that Tarantino's version is how it really played out but we all know that's a fairy tale. I imagined what really happened to those poor innocent souls on those nights and my heart shattered. I could not sleep that night nor the night after that.Tarantino, like he always does, made it feel very real. He made it so easy to empathize with the victims. The protective shield of the screen between me and the content had been viciously pierced. Tarantino played a dirty trick; as we all know our imagination is infinitely worse than reality except perhaps in the rare case of this very example. I'm so glad Tarantino took the classy route. Nonetheless, I have imagined what actually happened over and over again.We have become so immune to violence in today's culture from seeing our hyper violent material in our tv and movies (here's looking at you Tarantino.) And yet it was a Tarantino film that actually made me realize that the fascination surrounding crime and violence should not be merely observed as entertainment or morbid curiosity. It should be felt. You should be shaken to your very core. You shouldn't be able to sleep at night. You should feel violently repulsed and overcome with sadness. Innocent people died in the most brutal and heinous way possible at the hands of young drugged out psychopaths with nothing to live for but a madman's approval and a free place to live. Sharon Tate was the final one to die. She had to listen to her friends get stabbed to death before the killers finally on her while listening to her pleas to spare her only for the sake of her unborn son.It's such a crying shame, the killers weren't put to death. Young children know basic morality. Teenagers certainly do as well. Sure, some of them do foolish things like partake in drugs and dive head first into shallow pools. But they certainly know not to commit pre-meditated murder stabbing each victim no less than 20 odd times. In addition, they violated the dead; using their blood to smear filthy degrading words. In the case of the LaBianca murders they left the steak knife jutting out of the mans throat and pierced a fork into his stomach before they left. These people are real life monsters- the boogeymen and women. Please, we need to stop any sort of glorification of crime and criminals because this is exactly what they seek and desire.I hope this film urges everyone to sign the petitions to keep Tex Watson, Patricia Krenwinkle, Bobby Beausoleil, Bruce Davis and Lesley Van Houten behind bars because they were unfortunately given life with the chance of parole. Remember these are the same people who stabbed their victims repeatedly later bragging about it to cellmates. Prison is heaven compared to the punishment they truly deserve which probably shouldn't even be attempted to be achieved by us mere mortals anyway but at the very least they should never be let out for their sheer destruction and total lack of regard they had for human life. They will never be \"rehabilitated.\" Sure, they may be on their best behavior in prison and they may have \"found God\" now but I wonder where God was for Tex in between the moments when he was stabbing the life out of the 7 victims he mercilessly killed. I don't buy it for one minute. Every single one of the killers are almost as manipulative, duplicitous and cunning as Manson himself. I am so appalled.Sharon Tate's mother Doris Tate went on to become a champions of crime victims. Now the responsibility is squarely placed on the only surviving member of Sharon's immediate family- Debra who has gone to every single parole hearing of all of the Manson killers. Please for all the victims, for all the victims families, for Doris and for Debra please sign the petitions.", "best tarantino movie after pulp fiction": "This movie is insane, leonardo dicaprio and brad pitt are outstanding. the scenes where cliff booth (brad pitt) is driving and the music is playing is well done. the ending is super satisfying and the long runtime is worth it, this movie never got boring at any part", "Really": "I am a Tarantino fan but this was not good. The movie was well acted but had no real story. I would go as far as to say if anyone other than Tarantino had written this it would have never been a film. I got the concept of the movie \" in Hollywood anything is possible \" that wasn't enough to save this one.", "Don't get too excited over this movie.": "I am a big fan of Tarantino films. I was also excited to see the chemistry between 2 big Hollywood stars in Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt.\nThis was nothing like what you would expect from a Tarantino film. The only likeable character in this 2.5 hour snooze fest, was Cliff, played by Brad Pitt.In the 2.5 hours of plotless movie, I got up out of my seat twice, I was that bored.It also just ended. On nothing. For a moment, I had actually wondered why the cinema lights came back on.", "I don't give a lot of 10s": "This was a refreshing change. Not a movie you'll see churned out every other day. I think some people don't get it, for reasons I put below. It doesn't follow a tried and tested formula. It meanders, and that's why I like it. To me, it became clear after a while, that because Tarantino both writes and directs, he's giving the viewer a full experience. That's what movies are for.This movie is BEAUTIFULLY shot. Was really impressed at not only the cinematography, but the color correction. I don't know how Tarantino seems to charge each scene with such fullness of color and effortless blocking and composition. It makes it fun to just sit back and take a ride with Brad Pitt or watch Leo learning his lines. And the thing that surprised me most, was the originality of the ending.I won't give away any spoilers, but something that I don't think a lot of people here get, is the history of the Manson Family and the murder of actress Sharon Tate and four others in her home on August 8 and 9, 1969. If you don't know it, please give yourself a short history lesson before watching. It won't ruin any surprises in the movie, it's a bit painful to read, but will give the movie much more meaning if you know. Otherwise, it may feel very random. But learn about it, and you'll understand why the movie got it's title.", "It's the pursuit that's meaningful...": "\"It's the pursuit that's meaningful.\"It took me two viewings (out of three... so far) to figure out what this movie was about. It's subjective, the meaning of this film. Judging from the fact that many didn't see the point to it, that fact's obvious.I believe the film is about trying. Trying, even when you know no one will notice. Trying, doing your best, giving it your all, whatever you want to call it; This film is about trying. Trying, because, \"It's the pursuit that's meaningful.\"About midway through the film, our main character Rick Dalton meets his co-star on \"Lancer\", Trudi, a young girl who prefers to go by her on stage persona because she feels method acting allows her to perform better. And if she can perform better, she will. In her own words. Even if the audience of Lancer never notices her performance, she will give it her all. Because \"it's the pursuit that's meaningful.\"Rick Dalton is a has-been on his \"race to the bottom\", a man getting used to the fact that he's \"slightly more useless\". Yet, despite all of this, he tries. Despite being cast as the \"heavy\" on Lancer, the bad guy, he gives the performance his all. He tries. He knows no one will even notice it's him under \"all this junk\", as he calls his makeup and wardrobe, but he gives the performance his all. Because \"it's the pursuit that's meaningful.\" The pursuit of being just a *little* bit better. At the end of the film, Quentin doesn't give Rick his career back. There's no plot-twist where Rick has been dreaming the whole time, his career actually never having diminished. Nope. Rick is still on his downward spiral come the credits. Yet despite this, Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring still notice him. They still love and appreciate his work; two celebrities Rick is being taken over by in terms of popularity, and they still notice him. Love him. Because it was his pursuit that mattered. His pursuit of giving the best performances he could give. Nothing gold can (or will) stay, but if you give it your all, even when you think no one will notice, someone will.Cliff is no different, his story line following the same premise. He has, as he says himself, \"no career to begin with\", being only Rick's friend and handyman. But he loves it. He loves helping out around the house, doing whatever he can just to be a good friend. Why? Because \"it's the pursuit that's meaningful.\" Even if no one ever notices his work or who he is, Cliff is still a good friend. He tries. He does anything and everything he can for his friend. He tries. In fact, he sums up the moral of the film himself twice throughout the movie, once at the beginning and once at the end: \"I try,\" he says as Rick calls him a good friend. Because \"it's the pursuit that's meaningful.\" The pursuit of being the best friend he can be. Rick's pursuit of giving the best performance he can give. Sharon's pursuit of being the best person she can be, allowing a woman, a complete stranger, to hitch a ride with her, hugging her and wishing her luck on her journey. Even though no one other than the hitchhiker will ever know what she did for her, she did it anyway. Not for fame, not for attention, but in the pursuit of being the best person she can be.\"It's the pursuit that's meaningul.\"", "Epic, Brillant, Entertaining, Hilarious, Emotional - No Spoilers": "This is so good on so many levels. It's epic Tarantino style. It's difficult to review something without spoilers. So, here's my attempt without spoiling the movie with some persuasion.\nThis is how you should watch this movie. If your reading this and you haven't seen the movie, STOP. Drop everything you're doing and watch it. You'll even want to clear your calendar that day for another viewing later in the day. Early in the morning when nobody was awake, then the same day about 12 hours later.\nIf I were comparing it to music, I would say it's like Tchaikovsky's '1812 Overture', Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven', or even 'Suite Madame Blue' by STYX. If you haven't listened to that music, STOP what your doing and listen to that.\nThe character development was rich and found me identifying with each one in various ways. They way the movie was woven together is something of fine linen tapestry. You have to experience for yourself. You have to appreciate it in your own way. All this to say, go watch it. If you don't love it, then you haven't LIVED enough yet. And with that; \"It's official, good buddy, I'm a has-been\".", "Once Upon A Tarantino Goodbye Letter": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood reviewThe BeginningQuentin Tarantino, one of the most well known writers and directors of the 21st century and my personal favourite writer/director, widely recognised for his obsessive use of violence and gore accompanied by extremely unique and well written dialogue spoken by characters who have been exquisitely developed. 25 years ago Tarantino released the cult classic Pulp Fiction. A movie known for having non linear seperate stories that all correlate and meet together at the end. This concept was re used in a fresh and exciting way with his 9th and final film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, with there being three stories going on at the same time, Rick Daltons movie career, Cliff Booths downtime and life and finally Sharon Tate's life. Cliff and Ricks stories connect in many occasions and this works incredibly well even though they are both quite contrasting events. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth is played by Brad Pitt, as expected they are now the best movie duo I have seen in a long time.The GoodIf someone was to ask me, what was your favourite part about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, I would answer with full confidence the character interactions. DiCaprio and Pitt play friends in a such a believable way that it creates an extreme level of immersion in the story and is not doubted for a second. They do not both change the way the character would do something because the plot demands it, and of course this is because of excellent writing, but, the duo played the parts with such passion and realism that they deserve credit for it. Margot Robbie played the beautiful Sharon Tate, which she executed perfectly with her bubbly nature and excited personality. She truly connected with the character in the small amount of scenes she was present, speaking of which, a lot of the current media has criticised Tarantino for his choice to not include Margot as much as the other two, but i really believe that it was done with perfect style, she is made in a way that shows the viewers \"hey everyone this is a real person from this time and she is going to provide the more casual story\" which was done incredibly well. The plot is very well done with its constant nods to 60s and 70s culture at the same time as continuing with its own take on the period. The start of the movie with Rick Dalton meeting with Marvin Schwarzt played by a familiar face, Al Pacino, was a really good way to start the story. It set the mood, the time, the attitude of our characters, our characters problem and it showed what the characters wanted. Rick is an actor who starred in a western TV show called Bounty Law and hasn't had much of a time in anything else since. He really wants to be a face in the film industry but is struggling. Cliff is Ricks stuntman and friend who drives him around to where he needs to be, Cliff is very relaxed and likes where he is. A theory going around town suggests he killed his wife so no one will hire him, so he sticks with Rick. The story sounds familiar but completely breaks expectation with its focus on what actually happens during the time not just skipping days at a time to keep the movie moving. Cliffs interactions with the hippies is really unique and was done very stylistically with them being a cult and having a strange societal system. At one point there is a large focus around Ricks work on a new TV series called Lancer in which he plays a bad guy with a lot of attitude. Rick flunks his first day and goes off in a rage that was perfectly acted by Leo and i suspect partially improvised. The next day he goes back to the set to continue filming and this time does it superbly and has to do only one take, this starts the confidence within Rick which sparks him for the rest of the story. At the end Rick is eventually noticed by a fellow famous face in the Hollywood community and there we have our characters resolution, he has finally been noticed in Hollywood. This movie is the closest of tarantino's films to recreate the incredible style that was present in Pulp Fiction with different stories coming together at the end.The BadTo be fully truthful i am really struggling to find what i personally found bad about the film. The only parts i could say was; the hippies motive was pretty weak towards killing movie stars, Margot Robbie's story wasn't as interesting as the others so it slowed down some of the plot at times and the last scene was a little bit rushed at certain points but it did kind of work with the dialogue over the top of the scene.The UglyThe Ugly section is for any mistakes i notice. Whether it be on screen FX, make up fails, costume fails, setting fails, dialogue stuff ups and character breaking moments that didn't make sense. This movie included none of this, of course it didn't it's Quentin Tarantino, the perfectionist director.The VerdictOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood was a superb watch and is the perfect note for Tarantino to leave on. This movie was his final gift to us and his tribute to the golden age of hollywood and it's did a fine fucking job.10/10Golden Revolver Award\n(gonna use this as an award for movies that do their own style and nail it)", "A spectacular film": "I don't think it's perfect, but I do think it's beautiful... even magical", "Divides Opinion....but I really enjoyed it!": "Just seen this film...here's my thoughts.In reading some of the reviews on here, this film divides audiences. I'm on the positive side of the fence on this one.In short, it is not a straight forward film, so if you want things to happen, plot to move with pace, or have a blockbuster style narrative...this isn't going to easily please you.Some films don't require much in the way of an obvious overarching plot, clear sub plots, or clever twists, but are just happy to meander through a story, piecing a world one scene at a time.Yes it's a lover letter to film, of a place and of a time. And yes you could see this as self indulgence on Tarantino's part.I was happy to sit in this world for two odd hours, with quality scenes, acting and script. There are most definitely funny moments, whether they be obvious, nuanced or just because of Tarantino's trademark gratuitous violence.If you're still curious, go see the film.", "DISAPPOINTMENT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT": "With an all star cast and a great director, I had such high hopes. I haven't written any reviews before but I had to for this one. Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt are two of my favourite actors and they did no wrong, the acting as always, was superb.But the plot was the biggest joke! It had no meaning, no purpose, it wasn't heading anywhere! I genuinely don't know why this was made. Only the last 20 minutes were entertaining but that being said, it was random violence which was fun to watch after a bore fest.", "Not the Genre You Expect": "This movie is an extraordinarily well made bromance with a side of historical revisionism.", "Absolutely terrible": "Such a boring and flat movie, nothing absolutely nothing in the movie, could have watched the paint dry instrad", "Just such a pleasure to watch": "What I undoubtedly enjoyed about this movie the most, was the talent.The editing, camera angles, the acting. It's all just so damn pleasing to watch since it's done so VERY right. I haven't been a fan of all Tarantino's stories, but there's absolutely no doubt that the man knows how to make a film well.DiCaprio's acting was also just amazing again. There are plenty of good actors around (and tons in this movie), but I think he's the only one who goes above and beyond in selling me the scene. You can genuinely FEEL the emotion he portrays. Especially one scene where he gets angry... damn, I actually physically flinched at one point in the theater at the same time he motioned in anger. Genuinely surprised me too, haha.He just manages to make it feel so real, it'd be hard to watch without feeling the scene.The story was good. I mean, not the most thrilling ride, the most complex thing around or even the most meaningful, but certainly an enjoyable watch. While I don't think it had a very defined plot arch or a point, it never felt restless. Infact, the movie had a flow that made me weirdly relaxed and I just really enjoyed myself. I can't remember another movie right now that made me feel like that. The character chemistry also played a big part in that; I feel like I watched characters I genuinely liked.\nWould definitely enjoy seeing Pitt and DiCaprio more alongside one another. Worked fantastically.I also \"see what you did there\" Tarantino, with the ending. But saying any more would likely go to spoiler territory, so I'll refrain from saying anything.", "Great just great": "The way the story reimagines an awful event and turns it into a story that we wish had happened an old stunt man saving the day", "The Tarantino effect..": "This movie let you exit from the theater with an exited enthousiastic mood lasting many days... like an euphoric drug.\nAny spectator can't help after seeing it wanting to create or be part of a project like this one!Quentin build with maniacal precision an entire legendary world and realised for an other time the miracle to transmit with positive contagion his love for cinema.Full of evocative music, stories nested into the story and small situations and characters that let you wonder about human condition..\nLots of movies world references magically inserted by the maestro give real joy to experts.Some said that there could be lack of a plot but the similarity with Fellini's La Dolce Vita kind of storytelling structure is obvious. Moreover the suspense is growing during all the movie, like today only Tarantino is able to do..\nNo need to have a plot when he is playing with your mind and anything can happen at anytime... and you know it..\nThank you Quentin!\nYou are the only Director to give us \"trips\" in great \"parallel worlds\" like this!!", "Quentin Tarantino's Longing for Times Past": "Quentin Tarantino depicts 60's Hollywood in a way only he could. All of the staples of his filmmaking appear, but in a much more restrained fashion. The vast majority of the film lacks the grandiose swagger of his more recent films, but it successfully draws you into the atmosphere all the same. What some may view as bloated actually plays an essential role. Without letting the audience simmer in the magic of Tinseltown, Tarantino's signature explosive finale would lose its thematic punch. You may not get as much out of repeat viewings of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood compared to the rest of Tarantino's filmography, but the first time is exceptional enough.", "The very best..": "Ok, I've just seen Rambo First Blood, which is my favourite ever movie. But three weeks ago this was my favourite ever movie!! (Before that, and for the last 20 years it was Bladerunner.. ;-) Oscar nominations: Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director (the most important of these imho). I don't know about editing and stuff so you decide on that.. It just has an air of magic and awe for wonderful Hollywood... The sound track is kick ass, of course... Wonderfully weaving script; luminous Cinematography; all the actors are amazing, and Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt more amazing still.. Going to see it for the third time next week!! Peace..", "Reservoir Dogs meets The Twilight Zone on Acid.": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is many things: Tarantino's final film (allegedly), a love letter to the old Hollywood of 1969, the second time DiCaprio and Brad Pitt have worked together, DiCaprio's first film in four years since winning an Oscar for The Revenant Movie, Luke Perry's final film, an homage to Sergio Leone, spaghetti westerns and TV westerns of the 50's & 60's, a tribute to the talent and beauty of Sharon Tate, a revisionist history of the Manson murders and, possibly, Tarantino's magnum opus (which was his own working title), but for me it's also some of the most entertaining acting, directing and storytelling in recent memory and made me me forget where I was for 241 minutes because I was so entertained by the 179 cast members and Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio's extremely exciting and vital acting.Tarantino takes his time setting up this timeworn tale of a fading Hollywood western bad guy actor's descent into irrelevance with many intriguing set pieces such a Pitt's stuntman character beating up Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) on the set of the Green Hornet, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) arriving at the Playboy Mansion with Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch) and Michelle Phillips (Rebecca Rittenhouse) to meet Mama Cass (Rachel Redleaf) and a wry Steve McQueen, played eerily well by Damian Lewis smoking a joint with Connie Stevens (Dreama Walker), Timothy Olyphant as the fastest gun in the west on the set of actual 60's TV show 'Lancer' as re-envisioned by Tarantino, an interesting group of Manson girls including Dakota Fanning, Lena Dunham, Harley Quinn Smith (Kevin Smith's daughter) and Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Bruce Dern as George Spahn, owner of Charles Manson's Spahn Ranch, Michael Madsen as sheriff on the made-up TV western 'Bounty Hunter' which Matt Damon's character starred in. Also, Al Pacino has a major role as a film director trying to resurrect Rick Dalton's (Matt Damon) career by sending him to Italy to shoot spaghetti westerns and Kurt Russell both acts and narrates.My final analysis is that this film falls short of Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and Jackie Brown, but is definitely one that you don't want to miss. Think Reservoir Dogs meets The Twilight Zone on acid, and yes Brad Pitt does smoke an \"acid-laced cigarette\" just before the brutally violent and epic final scene with the Manson family that results in a horrific deaths, injuries and violence that may or may not include a very aggressive pitbull and a flame thrower.", "Second best Film of QT.

My cousin watched her first Tarantino movie and was told it was going to be violent. I can't imagine the shock of watching two hours of comedy, outstanding acting and a badass character (in case, you didn't know, Cliff Booth who deserves an Oscar for this role) and then people start getting mauled by Brandy, my favourite on-screen dog!

Let's point out that he was 6 in 1969, so how is this a love letter to anything? Tarantino keeps claiming he's only making ten movies. Here's hoping he quits.", "Not Tarantino for his 90s fans.": "This movie appears to be splitting critics for some obvious reasons which are nothing to do with the quality of whats on offer.\nThis is not the 90s wham bam constant action to a groovy soundtrack with multiple plot twists Tarantino movie.\nIf thats what you think you are getting you will be disappointed. This is a more mature and skilled Tarantino affair in which your own knowledge of cinema will be rewarded if you have that background. Think of Marvel Easter eggs but for film buffs.\nThis is a high quality movie which has great dialogue without being overly preachy or Tarantino-esque and lush cinematography.\nIts almost 2.45 hours long but doesnt feel too long, unless you were expecting a 90s Tarantino movie.\nThe mastery of the movie however is the story telling, you simply do not see coming what does and like Hitchcock, Tarantino is fantastic at building up tension. We expect the narrative to go one way however.....\nIn short you will need to see this before its ruined with spoilers.\nIt has been attacked on very simplistic, lazy and selfish identity politics reasoning.\nWe have critics who have attempted to quantize the value of female characters by using the metric of words spoken. However not by all the female characters just by one. Using this metric negates every other aspect of what an actor brings to the screen. If acting was judged on word count alone we would have some very odd looking movies. Its also telling that this highly selective metric is applied to only character. The odd thing is there are far more females in this movie than males. How does that add to the argument this is a sexist movie? Also the female characters are treated exactly the same as the males when they step out of line. If anything this movie does more to enhance the memory of Sharon Tate and extend her screen life than any identity politics rant that ignores facts in order to skew an audiences mind into not seeing the movie. The identity politics advocates real issue is that they did not like seeing women experience violence, they are loath to articulate this clearly so they label the movie as misogenistic. They know that if they did explicitly state this is that there are two main issues with this stance. Firstly that the Manson family are known for the murder of a pregnant woman and her child for no reason and secondly that they would be asking for special treatment for only the female Mansons, that is despite their violent intent they should be spared any violence because they are female. Clearly an immature position based on identity politics and laughably unfair. It appears they would rather see female Manson murderers get away it and receive therapy for their deeds instead of swift justice.\nAlso the other criticism seems to be about the fact you can see feet in the movie. However thats only an issue for those very odd people who hate feet, despite the fact they also have them.\nI actually find these people stranger than foot fetishists.\nThis movie treats its female characters as equals throughout and enhances the public image of Sharon Tate.\nThis is a major success for Tarantino in 2019.\nIts a very grown up movie for grown ups, ignore the identity politics brigade and the immature I hate feet people!", "A new style for tarantino": "I'm not an LA native nor american and also not born until the 80s but I thought the atmosphere of this movie felt very authentic. The vibe from the driving shots really takes you back in time and it was entertaining to just take it all in.The film is somewhat segmented with longer scenes that are all exciting and fun. I think it also gives room for actors themselves who watch it to appreciate the work that goes into making a movie and their performance.I enjoyed that Rick Dalton found self confidence again with the saloon scene and an impressive acting performance, along with the young girl. Sort of a movie within a movie.Once upon a time is a lot about film making - the story is not fast paced - but I never found it to be dragged out like some people here suggest.But only the ending comes together as a classic Tarantino.I also thought that Tarantino found a very respectful way to honor Sharon Tate and also to ridicule the real killers.In my opinion Tarantino was able to provide his singature type of \"fun\" violence without touching the tragic real life events of the past.", "Made me think": "I hate watching a movie too many days after it comes out and hearing the reviews. Because the reviews were great, my expectations were comprised. I try to see the movie and get my own determination.\nMaking a movie without a plot could be ingenious but it's not original. George Costanza said it about Seinfeld. Lol. I give credit to the director but it's not ground breaking.\nPeople want to be entertain as much as to think about the movie. Pulp fiction connected the dots. This didn't. I love Quinton because he always amazes. I was a little disappointed. Maybe after watching it another few times I'll get a different perspective. Sometimes that happens. Maybe that what Quinton was going for. He was thinking, they'll go see it two or three times and I'll make a fortune. I told you the guys' a genius.", "Don't waste your time": "Over two hours of nothing. Don't waste your time on this horrendous movie.", "Historical Reimagining": "Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is absolutely fabulous. The dialogue isn't as clever as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but the acting is far superior. The liberals and feminists will complain about the role of Sharon Tate and making her story about men, but this movie isn't her story. It's a historical reimagining. It's a showing of the times, and how everyone any one moment can change if something just a bit different would have happened. People need to stop being so damn sensitive and close minded. DiCaprio and Pitt put on fantastic performances, and Robbies Tate is terrific.The Bruce Lee scene as well as the finale steal the show. Go into this open minded and you'll see an instant classic. From the acting, to the soundtrack, to just the nostalgic feel, I can't stop thinking about it!", "The Best Movie of 2019": "So nice to see a film that ignores all the current movie tropes and just makes a fantastic movie with an all-star cast. This is Tarantino's Sunset Blvd except with a happy ending, and what an ending!", "The first two lines are about the film and the next 6 paragraphs are something that I would love to see him do in his next film": "Once upon a time in Hollywood is a classic that will take its to soak in and once you start to think about it you will love the film and you would just want to rewatch the film for atleast 2 more times. And yes now it will be me fanboying about Tarantino.Ever since I watched Pulp Fiction(cliche to say its my favourite) I fell in love with his style of filmmaking and many like me who started to discover cinema got their minds blown when they saw Pulp Fiction for the first time. The dialogue, the shots, the structure and ofcourse the music were top notch. After that we saw him make movies with tweaking the same structure and every single time he was better than what he did previously.So when the first announcement came saying that he is going to cast Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt I was really really excited to see what Quentin would do with the late 60's of Hollywood and I have to say he did not disappoint. I think despite its slow narrative(at times only) the movie always made me feel something special, something amazing. Tarantino played to his strengths with selecting the theme and he knocked it out of the park and made it clear that he still has a lot of potential and can make the audience go CRAZZY(yes double z) with whatever he puts on the screen.I hope I made it clear that I am a huge fanboy of Mr.Tarantino and would love to see him make movies for the rest of my life but he has some other plans and wants to end his career on high and making a ten film Tarantino collection. That means he is left with 1 or maybe 2 movies. So I want him to absolutely nail his last film and that would make it so satisfying for any movie lover and also a fanboy like me.And so I personally want him to make film in the universe of Pulp Fiction set in the present day. Same structure of jumbled chapters, twisted characters, funky music. I want to see his views on millennials and how he thinks we consume pop culture. Seeing something like that through his lens would make it such an entertaining film. We all know he hasn't made a picture based on the current time for over a decade now so that will be something that again I personally want.But why on the present day? You may ask. So as we all know he is not a huge fan of mobile phones, social media and particularly people watching a movie on a six inch screen. And again as we all know every millenial or for that matter every alternate person who owns a mobile phone is accused of doing that heinous act(according to Tarantino ofcourse). This is only one such example and I am sure there will be many more things that annoy him or there may be many other things that he loves. The thing is we only know about the Tarantino of the 90's(all his characters dialogues are his thoughts in a way) and we don't know the Tarantino of this decade.So all I can do is hope that he makes a film like that and a surprise ending with Bruce Willis (reference from M.Night Shyamaln's Split) would be the cherry on the cake.", "Took my breath away": "Tarantino's best. By the end of the film, I was literally crying. Bittersweet, really. Best ending I've seen in a while.I especially loved the true-grit nature of Brad Pitt's character (and his dog). And kudos to the rest of the cast, including DiCaprio, who flexed his considerable acting talent, and also to the young lady (Julia Butters) who played an eight-year-old actress on one of the sets.The music, costumes, makeup, sets, and locations totally nailed the era. The whole crew did a great job.I will watch this movie again; I loved it that much.(BTW, I don't know if everyone in the audience 'got' the film. My advice, if you're not super familiar with the Charles Manson story, is to watch the 2004 Helter Skelter TV film or read the book Helter Skelter.)", "name a better stuntman... i'll wait": "I've been stoned for 2 hours in the movie theater. quentin is best man to create different realities from the actual reality.\ni cried with the ending... y'all know why\nr.i.p sharon tate", "History 101, Tarantino Style": "Going in to OUATIH, I thought that this was going to be along the lines of a character study of an actor and his stunt double. Boy was I wrong, what I got was a signature Tarantino film (maybe even his best) with colorful characters, gorgeous set pieces and a look back in time.We follow the character of Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) and the relationship he has with his best friend and stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Dalton is at a point in his career where he feels like a washed up, has been and Cliff is along for the ride to act as his right hand.Parallel to this are the couple who lives next door to Rick, the real life couple of Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie).With the insertion of Sharon Tate, we as an audience know where the film will most likely end up. A tragedy that still haunts Hollywood to this day. I will not divulge what happens in the last half hour, but it's worth the price of admission.The writing is quintessential Quentin Tarantino. We've seen shades of these characters before (when Leo plays the villainous cowboy, it's easy to see his character from Django). You have cameos galore (Kurt Russell, Al Pacino, Dakota Fanning and a hilarious segment with Bruce Dern). When the hippy presence gets more and more prominent the tension goes through the roof especially when the name \"Manson\" gets thrown around, and then we cut to a pregnant Sharon Tate, the writing is on the wall.Performance wise, both of our lead actors deliver! Between the two I found myself leaning towards Brad Pitt as he seemed a tad bit more likable (the part where his character encounters Bruce Lee is awesome). But Leo is has his moments too, the blurred lines of comic and bad ass is splendidly acted. When it comes to Margo Robbie as Sharon Tate, her presence looms large over the film even when she's not on screen. When she is on screen however, the beauty and the innocent nature of the doomed starlet is captured excellently to the point where I wanted to give her a hug. There is a segment where she sees a recently released movie she did with Dean Martin in the theater and all Margo does is react to the film, and the reactions of the audience around her. Academy please remember Margo come January 2020!The soundtrack is very Tarantino, not much of a score but lots of old classic rock and roll that he incorporates perfectly. And the scenery is fantastic, it's like you get a tour of LA in 3 hours.All in all, hands down, favorite film of the year thus far", "Excellent": "Great movie, Tarantino is a master director. Pitt and DiCaprio are so good.", "a movie for those who appreciate the art of movies": "It's georgous, cinematic and a masterclass in genius acting.incredibly mature movie which tells an alternate story to occurrences of 1969 hollywood.", "A Wonderful Surprise from QT": "I don't consider myself a Tarantino fan but I'm rethinking that now. I realize my distrust stems from the level of violence in some of his movies. I approached this a bit warily as I am well studied in the historical events of the time.\nAbout half way through I remembered that I really liked Inglorious Bastards. I spent the bulk of the movie dreading the ending until the last 20 minutes.\nThis is both a love letter to an era that is long gone and a wish for a better ending for a sad period in our history. Other reviewers have adequately described the genius of Pitt and DiCaprio in this movie and I wholeheartedly agree. The casting, makeup, set decoration and the soundtrack-OMG The Soundtrack! All are perfection.I am so glad that the ending was a surprise.", "Worst film by QT": "NOTHING happens in this film. I considered walking out, I should have walked out.", "Such a waste with so big names": "Was hoping some directors magic to kick in and was waiting for it all the way, having no clue what the story is actually about. The story line is faded cannot make point, feels like the story is just to show how the 60s were, but hey no one's interested !!. Even without any hopes the movie doesn't get the audience anywhere. Waste of time !!!", "Another Masterpiece from Tarantino !": "I enjoyed every second of this movie , bravo Quentin Tarantino", "Cinematical disaster": "Even a group of very talented actors could not save this trashy debacle. Boring,slow, self indulgent crap show with no plot whatsoever.", "Non typical Tarantino": "Beautifully crafted, the story telling of an actor who was once adored by many, only to be more or less sent to the gutter and trying to find that one chance to hit the big time again!, along with his best friend and stunt double Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Pitt) give two of the best emotional yet crazy adventure throughout. As this isn't your swording swishing Kill Bill or gun toting Hateful Eight, Tarantino gives a different side to his collection of movies. The movie starts slow as we delve into 60's Hollywood and then the movie gets nuts.", "Good ending but almost fell asleep waiting for it": "Good ending but I was almost at sleep at times waiting for it. I knew something was going to happen because it's Tarantino and it's rated as including severe bloody violence but nearly two hours in I was still wondering when. There's clearly references to real people from that era that are famous but I missed most of them and in some cases didn't realise who they were until I looked them up after the movie. There's some good music and occasional funny bits but most of the time it doesn't go anywhere until the climatic ending. I imagine Tarantino fans and movie history buffs will love it but others will find it slow.", "Quentin Tarantino does it again..": "Quentin Tarantino does it again. This time enlisting Leonardo DiCaprio for a bigger role than he previously had in Django Unchained. The other main character is played by Brad Pitt who has worked with Tarantino in the past on True Romance and Inglorious Basterds. If I was to say that these two stars were absolutely incredible it would be an understatement. Yes they are huge stars but that doesn't mean they will automatically fit any role or perform highly. They both were perfect in their respective roles. The characters Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are both portrayed amazingly by Leo and Brad. There is also a handful of other amazing actors and actresses in this movie. I loved the set pieces and design. The movie felt like a look right into the past but in a fun crazy \"Tarantino\" style. I had a blast seeing it in the theater and I would recommend it to any fan of these actors just to see their performances alone. Also for any fans of Quentin Tarantino it is a must see. I personally loved it and I would give it a 10. Side note Margot Robbie, Margaret Qualley, Al Pacino, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Emile Hirsch, Kurt Russel, Luke Perry.. ect all did an amazing job as well! Don't forget that and many other side characters such as the actor who plays Bruce Lee he we great. Overall 10/10 for me I had a great experience with this one.", "Tarantino at his best": "Amazing brilliant cast brilliant soundtrack Brad pit is funny as hell", "Movie of the year": "This is hands down the greatest movie of 2019. The acting was outstanding brad Pitt will win an Oscar for his role in this movie that's how great he was", "This film is already underrated": "First off I loved this movie. Beautifully acted interesting and just so easy for me to watch personally. To the dedicated cinephile this is an incredible masterpiece. However I think people dislike this movie for all the wrong reasons. Tarantino to me seems like the kid who went to HighSchool with who got into a fight once and won but secretly hates fighting but everyone still wants him to fight more. To me Tarantino is at his best when he makes movies that are driven by the interesting characters in them rather than blood gore and one big climactic event that everything leads up to (nothing wrong with some blood though) For instance, everyone loves Pulp fiction and rightfully so that movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. This is a movie that is exciting fast-paced and sometimes extremely over the top. While entertaining, this style of moviemaking to me is not where Tarantino excels to his greatest extent and I feel like this isn't the type of movie Tarantino has liked to make for a long time as evidenced by how much he has had to cut out of the hateful 8 and Jackie Brown. Jackie Brown is another movie that suffers from the same problem in many people's eyes that once upon a time in Hollywood does. To some people both these stories may seem drawn-out overindulgent and Meandering. However I find these movies too much more interesting due to their much more realistic pacing and more interest in their characters as people rather than plot devices. As shown in other movies like The hateful eight and Jackie Brown flushing out the real sustenance of a character and putting that on screen is where Tarantino really tends to shine and is criminally underappreciated by many people. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is another one of those movies I feel Tarantino truly shines in the way he wants to. Here he has created a movie that is driven by and it is about the interesting people that lived 1960s Hollywood and their everyday experiences that made their lives so interesting rather than simply being about the huge climactic events that many people thought this movie would solely be about. Tarantino's choice to recreate the 1960s thoroughly in this film was also a huge reason why this movie truly shines in what it sets out to do. You can literally feel the town of Los Angeles from 50 years ago spring off the screen and come to life as you watch this movie. Don't go into this movie expecting an overzealous gorefest a True Crime documentary or an over-the-top drama. Go into this film expecting to be immersed in the world that Rick Cliff and Sharon live in and be prepared to thoroughly enjoy those people, their very interesting lives, the town that they lived in, the music and radio that they listen to, and the stories they have to tell. If you do this I can tell you right now you will fall in love with this film.", "Tarantino's best film by quite a bit": "None of the annoying dialogue of his earlier films, not much of the glorious violence of some of his noughties films, this is an odd film from the director. It holds his best qualities - an extreme attention to detail, a complete adoration of everything he puts in frame - but with somehow more maturity, more emotion. Have you ever cried in a Tarantino film before? OUATIH might be the first time that'll happen to you. I do not wish to reveal the ending, but I will say that he manages to deal with a real situation with respect and sophistication. Anyone offended or confused ought to think again about it. If this was to be the final Tarantino film it would be a perfect swan song - I can't think how his tenth could be better than this.", "Tribute to the ungraded of cinema ...": "With \"Once Upon a Time ...\" in Hollywood \"Tarantino\" goes out of the box and pays homage to the movie industry's humble and tender counterparts, an ode to the cinema as much as a reminder of the harsh reality of cinema. life. The cinema is beautiful ... but the life of those without degrees is much less, and yet without all these roles often overshadowed and limited anonymous are essential to the continuity of cinema. With this movie Tarantino and his two wonderful actors are: Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, this movie is both fun, upsetting, beautiful, a must of its kind.", "What if the Good Times Didn't Have to End?": "August 8th, 1969 - the whole hippy swell that was gaining momentum over the last 5 years came crashing down, the whole ideal of a generation simply evaporated - no gradual decline, no ceremony, the wave simply broke and rolled back. I read a review the other day where the commentator said something that made me rethink the movie: The question this movie asks is: \"What if the Good Times didn't have to End?\" What if we as a country didn't have to grow up, at least not then? Manson doesn't happen in this timeline, the climax makes sure of that. The movie is extremely unfocused and the Manson family is a very loose underpinning that doesn't quite hold it together. I don't come looking for flaws in a Tarantino movie (especially not one as gorgeous as this), but this was the first where I constantly noticed things that didn't fall into place without even actively looking for them - they were glaringly obvious. And the more I thought about it afterward, the more gripes I have. What's with the whole unresolved subplot with Cliff (Brad Pitt) and his wife? They introduce it abruptly maybe a third of the way into the movie, the characters mention it a couple times, then drop it just as abruptly. Manson was in the movie for maybe two minutes in one scene, then never seen again. It seems like he was lazily written out - at the Manson ranch the characters ask \"Where's Charlie?\" \"He's not here, man.\" \"Oh. Bummer.\" Why does the movie begin in February, then do a whole awkward time sip to 'Six Months Later'? Why not just begin in August? I guess the whole purpose was just to show that one scene of Charlie knocking on Tate's door looking for Brian Wilson, leading up to the events of the finale? Even then, they could've worked their way around that, especially given how awkwardly the movie is structured. A lot of it feels like a clip show, given all the random in-universe movie and TV scenes they sporadically show (there's even a clip where they use footage from The Great Escape (1963), but with DiCaprio digitally inserted in place of Steve McQueen). All that said, the fun outweighs the flaws - it's not Tarantino's best movie, but it is a damn good time. There were a couple instances when I noticed the running time, not to mention this was the first Tarantino movie where I thought \"okay, too much dialogue\" (and that was in one of the earliest scenes - the characters deliver their lines so slowly - not the usual rapid machine-gun fire 'His Girl Friday' cheeky exchanges we're used to from Tarantino). It could've been tightened up... But... would I have welcomed an even longer version? (as is, it's 2 hrs., 45 mins.) Yeah, I would. And the movie is re-watchable, if, for no other reason, because it's so crammed full of Easter Eggs and references and assorted trivia and nods and so many things to pick up on each time you watch it. Some have said that Tarantino has finally matured with this movie. Maybe, maybe not. His characters sure haven't - but since in this version of events the good times never ended, why should they?", "Tarantino is a genius, and we all know it by now.": "This is a beautifully filmed and crafted period piece where life and art are mixed into a cool, crazy collage. The film is an ode to Hollywood and to the 60s. DiCaprio and Pitt are superb! You will want to see this film again and again. It's wildy entertaining!", "Pure bliss for film and history obsessives.": "I understand some of the negative ratings, but if you're a lover of cinema, I don't comprehend how you can consider this anything shy of a masterpiece. It's a love letter to an era of film that no longer exists and to an era that might have been. Absolutely beautiful.", "A Fairytale only Tarantino Could Make": "Wonderful, thrilling film. This is what should have happened but didn't happen. I left the theater in a trance, knowing what really went down. This is Quentin's fantasy of a Hollywood that wasn't plagued by Manson. Though all performances are great, Brad Pitt an all-star as a problematic man who may or may not have killed his wife. And Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect as a depressed TV star. The real MVP is the pitbull Brandy -- best dog actor I have ever seen.", "A movie made by Tarantino for Tarantino": "I start by saying that I really like nearly every Tarantino movie, so much that I don't even check reviews before going to watch one of his. But this movie... is vastly inferior to all the others he ever made. Not a totally bad movie, but it didn't feel compelling either.The biggest culprit is the storyline, which is somewhat bland. It follows the normal lives of several people living in Hollywood - well at least the kind of normal you can expect from actors and stuntmen - and at some point it's also touching and interesting, but overall doesn't goes anywhere. One particular character grows and change along the storyline, but everyone else stays just the same or worse is never seen again.Tarantino also makes tons of reference to movie industry and self-references to his own movies - including Pussycat and various foot fetish - but I'm not really into this kind of things and I don't believe they can make a great movie when core aspects are lacking.It's an ok movie, but not something I'd want to watch again. I watched Pulp Fiction at least four time, Kill Bill three, the Hateful Eight twice. But Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is just... meh.", "Cheap Shots at Bruce Lee": "On the worst day of his life, Bruce Lee was one hundred times the man that Quentin Tarantino is on his best day of his life. Taking a random cheap shot at an iconic actor who has been dead forty years is the kind of thing Tarantino does to get free hype for the crap that are his films.Mister Gigantic Ego, Quentin Tarantino, put together another flashback to the past that he wishes he had been a part of. Back when Tarantino was renting out videos and washing down the booths at the adult video peep store where he was discovered by Joe Pesci, Tarantino dreamed of being somebody like Brad Pitt. Now his fantasy has finally come true.This movie is so boring that I was asleep before the supposedly exciting ending. The part I saw was typical of any over-rated Quentin Tarantino movie. The dialogue was horrible, and the movie blows chunks.", "Tarantino's 60s": "A project enveloped in Tarantino's fansination with old Hollywood. A great path of mystery, murder and of course a twisted version of actual events. Near perfect dialogue and monologues once again pepper Tarantino's film, characters that envoke the acting talents of DiCaprio and Pitt. Pitt's mysterious and brutesk performance is a winner for me.", "Quirky, Edgy, Dark, Funny": "I read a review that viewed this movie as social commentary, posing the question of what would have happened if Sharon Tate hadn't been killed by the Manson family. I must have watched a different movie. First, the movie doesn't tell us what would have happened one way or another. Second, we don't know from the movie that Sharon Tate wasn't killed. We don't see her in the end scene. Actually, in the end scene, I was left wondering if Leonardo's character would be murdered when he got to the Tate house. That other review said that Leonardo's character had finally been invited into the status that he had coveted. He may have been invited to the house, but we don't know what happened to him once he got there. The ending had a spooky feeling, and I was surprised the other reviewer had been able to read so much into what is essentially unknown. Now, if you want to watch it and then use it as a party game to come up with might have been an ending, that's fine. Other than that, the ending is -- well -- open-ended. I liked the movie. I found it humorous when these two guys stumbled into the Manson family retreat. I know the significance of that and, were it me, I'd have been out as quickly as possible. The characters didn't know what they were dealing with, which gave the movie both a dark humor and a kind of edginess.", "I got a massive headache from being hit over the head with symbolism for 2.5 hours AND LOVE IT.": "Spoilers ... like lots and lots of Spoilers.First, I have not read any reviews, or critical analysis of the film, so apologies if this has already been echoed online. I just got out of a 7am viewing of Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood at the Cineramadome. I suggest you do the same. The film is up there as one of his greatest, and for me, it leaves me digging and finding treasures like an addict trying to scrape the pipe for another hit. Haven't felt this way since I saw Pulp Fiction and talked about the briefcase and the band-aide on the back of Marsellus Wallace\"s head.On the \"surface\" this is a western, mostly about westerns shot in Hollywood, when Hollywood could be seen going through it's \"western\" phase. Tarantino nails it showing tinseltown as a dust bowl, saloon driven, wild west where anything, even a dude like Charlie Manson existing, could happen.It's also about the Bible.Well, the way I see it, Brad Pitt is an anti-hero, the real cowboy doing real cowboy stuff. Fighting dudes, going into the lion's lair, saving the day. We don't know if he's good or bad, did he kill his wife or not, don't matter none, like Dirty Harry, he's in it for himself.He's also the one that is leading Leo through the whole movie, driving him around, giving him advice, carrying his bags, boosting his ego, and yeah \"carrying the load\". Sounds a lot like the Holy Spirit. At the end when those hippies announce they are the devil to do \"the devil's work\" who protects Leo ... Brad.Leo does toast the last one. He literally sets water on fire to smite his enemies. I mean that's pretty biblical.But most of all ... we can't ignore the ending where Quinten kinda beats us over the head with the Holy metaphor. First, we see Jay Sebring ... or ... JC as he's called over the speaker through the gates. Not just gates. See those lights around the gates? Look like giant ... pearls? yeah, they do, hence, pearly gates. And the intercom talking to Leo ... kinda like, I donno, the voice of God? Calling him through the gates? Yeah kinda ... we then go up and over the house, a reverse of a shot earlier in the film, to see a \"God view\" of the backyard where Leo is received and told \"he is a great actor\" the divine gift he's been searching for. There's also two cars there, which are the same two cars we've seen in the movie the whole time, just, divine versions of them. This is heaven.I have to see the film again ... I think there are a lot more themes and gifts like these that are woven in the story... The ad on the car radio for \"Heaven Scent\" when we're introduced to Sharon Tate ... her wearing white boots then seen barefoot in the theater, then the hippie girl representing temptation putting her feet up in the car ... the book she buys for Roman ... the way the child actor is portrayed, calling Disney a genius (who pushed the princess archetype into society as far as it would go) and saying \"sometimes I throw myself down even when I'm not acting\" cause she has hidden \"padding\" protecting her ... vs the extreme violence he shows towards \"modern feminists\" represented by the face bashed hippies. Does Brad Pitt represent toxic masculinity pushing his way past the army of women to check on the old blind man of yesteryear to make sure he's alright. Does he not threaten the women that he will break every tooth in the only man that is seen as their equal on the ranch? Are the women not dressed exactly the same as the man that come to the home, a sure sign of equality, and after the battle does he not advise Leo to go lie with his beautiful creature of a wife, a token picked up from a foreign crusade in Italy literally the holy-land.Is OUATIH about how \"Hollywood\" misrepresented and oppressed women for years to come? Is this Tarantino's message? Did Leo find salvation at the end of the film or is destined to live a phony life? Find out next time, same Bat blog, same Bat URL.RsOh ... tell me no one saw that \"shining\" painting of Leo in the driveway shift his gaze from right to left, literally staring at him in the last scene? Wanna talk about that?Oh ... the commercials on the radio ... I mean when we see Polanski and Tate there is literally an ad for \"heaven scent\" cologne. I mean ... (Thanks Jackie for that one;)", "An unfettered, nostalgia-fueled ego trip": "What Once Upon a Time in Hollywood could have really used was someone on set to tell Quentin Tarantino no. No Quentin, you shouldn't show multiple extended scenes from fake movies (and real movies) that don't really move the plot forward. No Quentin, your nostalgia for a bygone era isn't a good reason to make the audience watch characters drive around and listen to music for hours. I really like pieces of this movie, but I didn't enjoy it as a whole.", "A Beautiful Homage to an Era Long Gone": "This may not be Tarantino's best film of all 9 he's accomplished, nevertheless, this one remains one of his finest works. Tarantino pays a very beautiful and marvelously done tribute to the Hollywood era that raised him and that stood out for being the last great epoch for American entertainment. If you've seen his previous films, you will notice he adds a touch of classic throwbacks through references of his favorite genres, from exploitation films to spaghetti westerns. In this film, however, it's an entire feature that perfectly encapsulates the era in which all those genres he dearly loves emanated from. Tarantino deviates us from his recognizable plot developments and instead takes us in a \"hang-out\" plot journey, in which what matters isn't necessarily what will happen to the characters, but what the characters are doing in a specific event. It's about getting to know the characters more personally, thus reciprocating with Tarantino's intention for the audience to be immersed into a 1960s Hollywood setting. If you watch closely, in this film, Tarantino focuses in the sound, (radio stations, TV shows announcers), and the images (cinemas, drive-ins, posters, city life), and uses the characters in order to navigate these time-era elements. It's definitely clear that Tarantino made this movie a nostalgia voyage, and he depicts this era as a precious gem that was taken away by the counterculture as its later expressed in the film. Truly for me this film experience was invigorating to my soul as a cinephile, Tarantino fan, and a lover of the classic genre.", "We dont deserve this movie...": "Thanks God cuz Pulp Fiction was made in another era, otherwise it would have been reviewed by nowdays audience, or fans of CGI and Fast and Furious. This movie like Pulp Fiction, is not about the plot. Pulp Fiction has no plot as well. Once upon a time in Hollywood is about the characters and about situations. You need to have some culture in movies to like this one. Of course is too long for if you started to watch movies after 2005. It s obvious that you never seen the old classic movies. Then you wondering why cinema has changed and we dont have good movies anymore. Because of you guys, new generation, with no patience, fans of CGi, Fast and Furious, etc. Cinema will never be the same because of nowdays audience without culture in movie. Thank you Tarantino for this amazing movie!", "Movie of a decade": "I am not American. I am under 30. I have never been in Los Angeles... But I totally LOVE this movie. I watched it 3 times by now. And I have a feeling that I will watch it more in a time.This movie is done with true passion by a well-known movie geek, I can tell you that.10/10 Masterpiece, in my honest opinion", "Viewer's Purgatory": "Trapped in a strange place between reality and fiction, the viewer stays in a strange purgatory awaiting to understand how the separate story lines come together. However, the story lines never really intertwine and you're left wondering what exactly the film was about.Good performances and an all-star cast distract you from the lack of a strong plot.", "Tarantino did it again": "Everyone needs to see this. The 60s vibes and classic Tarantino spin pair exceptionally well. Casting is on par with Pulp Fiction as the chemistry within the duo really sells the movie and initially drew me to this movie.", "Very good": "The actors are all good and the story is from another world and I love Leo very much as well as Brad Pitt", "An entertaining and epic Tarantino film that most certainly lived up to the hype": "This being the 9th film by Quintin Tarantino, I was worried that there would be signs of fatigue but this couldn't be farther form the truth. Once upon a time in Hollywood is one of the best films of the year hands down. The performances from DiCaprio and Pitt are phenomenal as well as there chemistry on screen. The love letter to the golden age of Hollywood and the vibrant 1969 Las Angeles depicted in this film, envelope you in this time in history. Once upon a time in Hollywood is yet another Tarantino film that does not disappoint", "Inglourious Hollywood": "Having a lot of knowledge about the events of August 8-9, 1969, I watched the movie unfold in a leisurely, meandering fashion, with growing apprehension about the third act.Never boring, the gradual setup dipped deep into the lives of a rising star, a has-been and the somewhat successful Hollywood workers around them, alongside the most inscrutable of the counterculture players, skipping over everyone in the middle. Dialog is obvious and off-center in turns, with moments of brilliance and opportunities for actors to show their chops. Lots of great feedback out there about Brad Pitt, but he's not challenged to move much of an arc, where Dicaprio gets the full range. Thin part for Robbie, but her whole function is to be someone you don't want to see die. Not a weak performance in the film, though some of the parts are underwritten. Not a real criticism, however, as there is a huge cast and there's just so much emotional investment a viewer can make.Tarentino loves the time period and it's a joy to watch for his regular retimue to make their appearances, however briefly (I for one hope Tim Roth is restored in a future DVD release).Music as always drives the story and the sardonic use of 12:30 by the Mamas and the Papas is particularly poignant.Thank you Quentin for the catharsis of the last 10 minutes. Easily a 9/10 and a film that will bear repeated viewing.", "Loved it.": "I want to be entertained; not dissect facts or realities. If you watch movies to do that, you're missing the point of the joy of being an audience member. I'm fond of tv or cinema with alternate realities. This was that. You're entitled to hate on Tarantino or his style or his person. I don't love him or hate him. This was a dark dramedy based on the past, and it captured that late 60s/early 70s Hollywood. A tad long but enjoyable.", "Absolutely genius potray of art": "When u see such Huge star cast u do expect some powerful piece of art from them... As for the movie Tarantino potrays the culture of Hollywood back in 60's..this movie really excites you as it goes further and you will se unexpected twist in the climax and characters played by Brad and Caprio each has a significant role in this movie..overall a must must watch movie", "Exceptional, no other words": "To sum up - completely sucked into this movie, the '70s vibe and the supreme play by all characters. Gonna watch it again in the theatre tomorrow.", "Don't waste Your Time": "There was absolutely no point to this movie. A root canal would have been more exciting. Listening to my hair dresser recap her entire shift would have been more intellectually stimulating.I'll never get those hours back.How is this getting such high reviews?", "Good and a unique movie, but should have given more insight and focus more on the Manson stuff.": "It certainly was an entertaining, good and an unique movie, but I wish that it had given more insight on Cliff allegedly killing his wife, all we got was one scene with him on a boat with him. Also the Charles Manson cult plot was very small and a bit confusing.", "Best movie of 2019": "An homage to the golden age of cinema and simply one of the best Tarantino films to date", "LEO!!!!": "If this dude doesn't score another Oscar nomination then the Academy is full of losers. He's amazing, as usual!", "Fan-fricking-tasting!": "I was looking so forward to this film coming out because usually the summer is a dismal stretch of endless loud, stupid blockbuster films appealing to the lowest common denominator. It did not disappoint in any way, shape or form. I was transfixed for almost three hours and got completely choked up at the end, wishing the events of August 9, 1969 had gone down as depicted in the film. Leo and Brad Pitt are shoe-ins for Oscar noms, and the supporting cast was fabulous - each and every one of them. In fact, my husband and I are going to see it again next week (I've never seen the same film twice in the theatre), so that is indicative of just how much I enjoyed it. Well done, Mr. Tarantino!", "Yawn": "This film was painfully slow, I only really enjoyed the last 45 minutes. Other than that it was a film about nothing although I do admit to falling asleep during parts of it.", "Fell in love with this movie": "I really enjoyed watching this movie, it made me smile and i loved how good Tarantino portrayed the late 60's in Hollywood.. The vibe was just so great i didnt want this movie to end. I hope we could have more movies like this.And for those who calls this movie boring, i dont really get ur point. Do we really need all movies like John Wick or Avengers where all we see is action and cgi where non of it is real? If u wanted big action movie why did u went to see it in first place? It says its Comedy/Drama about late 60's movie making in Hollywood. What did u expect?", "***k the bad reviews": "***k the bad reviews....this was A RIOT to watch....I watched it twice back to back.What's not to like?", "Failed to deliver": "I did not manage to care one bit about the 2 main caracters , this made the movie even longer and more boring then already is .", "Quentin Tarantino pleasuring himself": "Almost 3 hours of total boredom. And I had alot of homework to do before and after the movie, to truly understand the movie. Yes the acting is incredible and the cinematography is great. But this movie is not for the common audience like me, it's for Quentin Tarantinos friends...", "Grow up, Quentin": "I want to like Quentin's stuff again - his first two films are some of my favourites ever, and Jackie Brown was is an unappreciated slow burner of a gem - but he has lost me with a series of overlong vanity projects which only get a pass because of who directed them and the excellence (and significance of, for that matter) of his prior work. But success is meant to be built upon, not besides to, and his 21st century work - sans the admittedly good The Hateful Eight - is a testament to that.Unfortunately, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is no different. While it is the least bad of his bad films, it is still completely underwhelming.The main problem is that it seems that Tarantino for whatever reason has become extremely sloppy as a writer, and to see the collapse in quality of his work from Pulp Fiction to this is almost painful to watch.The film is once again overlong at nearly 3 hours - a runtime not justified whatsoever, especially with a character and plot this thin. Unless you're making War and Peace or Lord of The Rings, keeping films to 2 hours at most is usually wise. To quote Roger Corman 'No film should be longer than 90 minutes unless it has Papal dispensation'. If only Quentin could learn such wisdom. Or hire a decent editor, for that matter.This is mainly because none of the characters have any arc to them, sans that of DiCaprio's, of which is resolved within the first 90 minutes and has no stakes or tension to it at all.Robert Downey Snr. Noted that for any screenplay to work, a main character always needs to be 'in a hurry'. It seems like Tarantino forgot this basic rule, because nowhere in this film is there any legitimate stakes involved or goals to be reached. If there is no conflict in a story, there is boredom, and this movie is perhaps Tarantino's most boring outside of the equally dull Django Unchained. It doesn't help that all of the characters talk like Tarantino himself - even the children do, for goodness sake. It becomes an unintentional version of that scene in Being John Malkovich whereby the eponymous actor goes inside his own mind to find everyone there looks and talks like him, but without the clever writing and awkwardness that made that stuff worth it.The weak plot itself doesn't help - the main instigator of the story (that being the unwise inclusion of the M. Familys and Sharon Tate - more on that later) doesn't start until an hour in, and runs out of steam by the end. Meanwhile all between this we are watching overlong Bruce Lee fight scenes and party parts and a lot of it indeed goes nowhere. I know Tarantino likes to use the term 'hangout movie' to describe stuff like this, but that is excusable in films which have strong enough characters to justify that style of filmmaking, like Five Easy Pieces or Clerks, for example. Far less so when the characters have no noticeable goals or any depth to them, with the only personality being of the actors who play them.Meanwhile, it has legitimately nothing to say about the time period it takes place in, the movie industry in that time period or even the hippy counterculture it touches on. Why make it a period piece if you don't say anything about the period you place it in, especially given Quentin's love for that era of filmmaking as well? It is all a big missed opportunity, especially in light of how at least his other period pieces had something to say about their respective time periods, or used such a setting to aid the story. It seems that Tarantino is so concerned of portraying that era as idyllically as possible that he refuses to portray it in any other way than in a bland non-judgemental way.So given that the story and characters are no good, all the while wasting its period setting for nothing, it seems that it couldn't get worse, could it?Sadly it does. Oh God it does. It's now time to address the elephant in the room - the M. Familys. Now while I was always worried about that rearing its ugly head in this movie - whatever Tarantino does well, being subtle and in good taste isn't it, especially in most of his 21st century film in which sadistic violence goes way too far, too often for the sake of it - this movie unfortunately met that low bar and ran with it. In fact, with all the questionable controversial historical topics Tarantino has exploited for his films in the past - World War 2 and the American Civil War - this has to be the worst in terms of tone, misjudgement and simple taste alone.Why, dear reader I hear you ask? It's because the Family themselves, instead of being the dangerous cult that they were, are portrayed as dim witted hippies at best, and as Saturday morning cartoon villains at worst. That seems to me to be totally tasteless given how evil they actually were, and how recent the events actually were. Compare this to his other portrayals of this stuff. In Inglorious Basterds, the German soldiers there are portrayed fairly realistically given what happened (many of them being basic soldiers and nothing more) and the true villains were at least portrayed as nasty slime who could have actually been, and not cartoonish bad guys. Compare it to this film, whereby the M. Family Family and the Tate murders is the entire impetus for at least the second half and eats a good chunk of the film. Add to that the fact that the cult members in the film are all the real life ones, as well as these events being far more recent than the aforementioned WW2, and it makes all the worse. Meanwhile Tate herself has little role, and few scenes as well - not to mention how they get an actress who doesn't look like her, which is quite distracting when she watches one of her actual films in-movie - making it a waste of her character, and undermining her tragedy in that way as well. Way to go, Quentin.Meanwhile, their deaths in the film makes the problem far more damning. All of them are extremely violent and probably aren't too far off the Jim VanBebber version of this tale (albeit with a far higher budget), and feel all in very bad taste, given both that those involved were real people and that it directly changes the coarse of history (Sharon Tate lives, in case you didn't know). It once again feels rather rotten and morally bankrupt, especially given how recent this stuff was, and how badly it pales in comparison to the aforementioned period pieces that QT has done - mainly that with Inglorious Basterds, WW2 German soldiers have already been the jokey and OTT bad guys in several movies and video games at this point, as well as how in Django, none of the people involved were real. And given that this film has no sense of humour or tongue-in-cheek elements to speak of much, of which would have gone some way to justify the inclusion of the M. Familys and Sharon Tate.It all reminds me of comic book writer Grant Morrison criticising his fellow alumni Frank Miller (another Tarantino surrogate! Why does it keep coming back to that? Never mind.) when he was writing his graphic novel Holy Terror as a Batman story. There, Morrison stated that it was 'decadent indulgence when real terrorists are killing real people in the real world'. That is as true for QT as it is for his chum Frankie boy - given how serious the M. Family murders actually were, and the deaths and horror caused, it is beyond inappropriate to portray in such a dumbed down, comic book-esque fashion. Now this stuff is undeniably tricky, and while I'm glad he at least had the hutzpah to get approval from Sharon's sister Debra Tate (and I'm not for one second doubting her judgement here), the fact that he went for this at all speaks rather poorly to him, and his overall taste. I just can't wait for his inevitable film on the next tragedy he wants to turn in to exploitation sleaze.But the reason that the rating isn't significantly lower is that it has good points, and it's main crime is that (sans the M. Family stuff), it's just incredibly boring and not very interesting. It is bland rather than annoyingly offensive and evil, like his worst work in the Kill Bill movies and Django Unchained.The good points are here meanwhile. The acting, as expected from Tarantino, is great. This even includes the nepotist Maya Hawke who does a great job of playing herself (as a ditzy young hippie, of course!). Meanwhile, the film is very well shot, and the period detail is definitely the most on point it has been for any of Tarantino's period pieces. Including a good Bruce Lee lookalike and Damien Lewis being on point as Steve McQueen was a nice touch. And while there isn't much character development on display, that which is there is much welcomed - especially that of DiCaprio's when it comes, making it the most entertaining parts of the movie as a result.But overall, this is weak and Tarantino on his bad form again. It is overlong non-period piece with weak characterisation and storytelling, which in no way justifies its nearly 3 hour runtime. Meanwhile, it's portrayal of the M. Familys perhaps is the worst and most misjudged one of that case in movie history, and definitely the worst of QT's period pieces. It is well-acted and shot, but all of that can't polish a turd. It is a shame, given how talented he was once was, and The Hateful Eight showed signs of what he could be. But for now, we're stuck with this. Hopefully his last movie will be much better than this.", "Once upon a time he made great movies": "If you like like watching famous faces make short cameos with no discernible point, this is the movie for you.\nHow this movie is so highly rated is unbelievable.

It's not about the Manson murders, Sharon Tate, Rick or Cliff. It's not about showing 60-70's Hollywood. This movie represents exactly what it looks like trying to make it in the movie industry. At first you eat a lot of crap, and you do it for a long time. And then a bizarre random chain of events happen which then launch your career to the stars.", "This movie is great but not for everyone...": "I would like to start of this review with saying that this movie is not for everyone.

What a waste of my time!", "It would be a crime drama not to see this one": "I don't know if Quintin set out to make this his masterpiece or not, but this is it. I can't praise enough the pairing of Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, although I will admit that at first I wasn't sure. I did sit back and wonder for a bit, which I now see as a masterful stroke.Tarantino somehow managed to take LA back to a time which is long gone today, and I can't figure out how he did so. He filmed every subtle aspect of a town that only lives in memory today. You can't go to Los Angeles today expecting to see even a hint of 1960s LA hidden behind some new facade. It simply isn't there. But for three hours you can see what is no long there, thanks to Quintin and his crew.The story is as goofy as 1960s LA was. And it is delightful to see. This movie is just plain fun.I didn't quite catch on to Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio right way, then I let myself go and laughed hard at myself for expecting anything different. What excellent acting on each one's part! Superb! I gotta say, Brad was my favorite.This entire movie is a caricature created by Tarantino and performed by a slew of talent you won't grow tired of seeing sprung on you. There are so many surprises you'll sit and giggle after the credits roll at how many times you were fooled. Quintin will trick you time and again, and each time you will be delighted.Delighted it the best way to describe this movie. You will be.", "A little slow, although unique and enjoyable": "Not Tarantino's best film but I still found it worth the watch. The story is one that I'd never really considered 1960s Hollywood. To be honest I thought it was set in 1930s Hollywood when I'd heard about the Golden Age of Hollywood. However, the story did seem very random and strange. Maybe more for Quentins enjoyment than his audience? A film he'd always wanted to make, as part of his 10 movies.The story felt a bit long at times, but made sense as you slowly started to see what the point of the movie was. Which was, how do we cope with growing out of a role that weve been so well known and loved for. How do you reinvent yourself when you leave your career? Something all of us face, classically described as the mid-life crisis.The ending of the movie was probably the best part for me. Although very violent, it was the characters redemption where they again find their new path out of the mid-life crisis.The flamethrower scene was epic and actually left me quite shocked. A hard scene to stay quiet for watching on a plane.Margot Robbie was in the movie less than I thought she'd be, and the hippie scenes left me quite uncomfortable. But overall once you get the idea of the movie, how the three characters relate to each other and what this time was all about the film becomes quite entertaining, and probably worth a second watch in a few years time.Still one of the best directors in my opinion.", "Classic Tarantino entertainer": "There are few things like watching a Tarantino movie in a movie house.

Just the whole story was boring, with small interesting minutes in the middle (like the Bruce Lee scene). The ending is the best part but I don't find it superior or more creative than your average movie.

Never seen so many people walk out of a movie", "A Tarantino Valentine -- and Perhaps His Greatest Cinematic Legacy": "Some people have asked my opinion of Quentin Tarantino's latest film, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" since I resided there during the period in which the movie is set (the film spans February-August of 1969, and I moved into an apartment in the heart of downtown Hollywood, across from Grauman's Chinese Theatre, in June of 1970). I can't recall being as pleasantly surprised and so fully entertained by a film since 1973's \"The Sting,\" with both films featuring two engaging, charismatic stars meshing so perfectly in an equally engrossing and lovingly escapist tale. It's fun, worth the time -- and the highest compliment of all -- makes you want to see it again. Serendipitously, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" touches upon some things that have very personal reference points for me. For instance, Leonardo DiCaprio's '50's Western star Rick Dalton trying to rebound in popularity and status reminds me of my first half-hour in Hollywood, when I met '50s Western star Hugh O'Brian (\"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\"), who was starring in a so-so TV movie in which a close friend of mine had a supporting role. O'Brian had been one of my idols growing up (his series, which debuted in 1955, was one of the first so-called \"adult Westerns\" and had been highly rated -- I had watched it since grade school). It was a rather sad moment. O'Brian couldn't have been kinder (I was a young actor, obviously green as grass), but the feeling of his trying to regain some sort of lost stature was palpable. For that reason I found DiCaprio's portrayal of Dalton dead-on. He was superb. When Dalton finds some degree of encouragement with a supporting role in the old cop show \"The F.B.I.,\" I had to laugh. Two weeks before I moved into my little bachelor apartment, the series had actually shot an episode in my living room (the tenants were still abuzz about that). When Tarantino sweeps by the Cinerama Dome theater -- that was the first place I went to see a movie upon arriving in Hollywood. The historic Musso & Frank Grill was one of the first places old Hollywood hands insisted I go, and it became a kind of second home when I wanted to get out among \"people.\" When Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate visits the venerable Larry Edmunds Bookshop, that was yet another frequent haunt that Hollywood veterans had introduced me too. Brad Pitt, who plays DiCaprio's close friend and stunt double Cliff Booth in perhaps his best performance yet (which is saying a lot), also resonated with me. One of my first acquaintances, whom I had met in a Steve McQueen-produced movie that brought me to Hollywood, was one of Hollywood's leading stunt men (think doubling for Clint Eastwood). Pitt absolutely nails the attitude and swagger of this important and all too often underappreciated class of performers. As for McQueen himself, Damian Lewis' brief turn as the superstar is chillingly accurate. You feel as if you're watching and listening to the real deal (even though McQueen has been gone since 1980, dying well before his time at the age of 50). Then there are the peripheral characters, like the late singer Mama Cass Elliot; I had literally run into her at a Hollywood premiere (and subsequently found myself with her and actress Angela Lansbury searching a parking garage for our cars after the screening). Most importantly, Tarantino captures exactly the look and feel of Hollywood at that time, without being musty, mocking or condescending. My only beef with the film, and it's a slight one, is that I thought Robbie's Sharon Tate came off a little featherbrained; I think the intent was to show her as an innocent, but in my mind the characterization didn't quite get there. And I'm not sure I was that taken with Al Pacino's portrayal of a sleazy casting agent, which seemed a bit too stagey and over the top. As for the story, which has Tarantino doing some revising of the Manson Family tragedy, it has an interesting twist regarding our heroes (to say much more would give away the plot). But all in all, I LOVED the film (I saw it on my birthday -- it was a gift from my family), and for me it was both an entertainment and a trip back to a special time. Those who have called this Tarantino's valentine to Hollywood -- and film -- have got it right. It's jammed with so much delicious Hollywood trivia of the day that only the most genuine lover of the industry could have put it all together in such a perfect, meaningful way. The movie is a keeper, and may come to be regarded as one of Tarantino's greatest cinematic legacies. It's that good -- and a Hollywood aficionado's delight.", "One lime": "Tarantino is a master of suspense, a conneisier of comedy. This is his most affectionate film yet", "Premise is advised": "Some people who saw this movie must not be aware of the background of the story. A person behind me at the theater said she would need someone to explain this film to her. If she were to give a review of the movie she would rate it low also. Knowing the story made it a transcendent story of redemption where somehow you can remember a tragic event as triumphant moment of spirit over evil . Tarantino\"s magic is in how he succeeds at juxtaposing comedy with tragedy like very few others have done.", "Patient, Fun and Lovable": "*HINTED SPOILERS*Following 'The Hateful Eight' arrives\nTarantino's 9th and second last film 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'. Here we see fading actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) attempting to capture the spotlight again with stunt double and best friend, WWII veteran Cliff Booth (Pitt) by his side. Let's talk about it.The acting is PHENOMENAL. The buddy chemistry between DiCaprio and Pitt is undescribably good and both play extremely flawed yet lovable and charismatic characters. The characters are so investing and detailed to the point where eventually you see them for who they are and not their actor.The film is also vibrant and is shot extremely well, depicting a beautiful fairytale version of a 60s LA.As with every Tarantino film, the dialogue and comedy is spot on with not many flaws I can pick out. Although the dialogue and comedy is rather exaggerated to unrealistic levels at certain points, it is still one hell of a fun ride.One major flaw I will point out however is the pacing at some points. The film will continuously give you an interesting moment with the characters but some moments will test your patience if you are more of a casual filmgoer. Personally I didn't have an issue with pacing but a 3 hour runtime does have its issues. The ending is also extremely divisive. Again, I loved it and it was an almost sombre in a happy way type of ending but some might feel a disconnect from the film after what they just watched.Overall, the film is a fun time and shouldn't be taken seriously at all. It is an exaggeration and makes fun of a time and people that are long since gone. It is not as detailed nor 'narratively unique' as Tarantino's previous work but either way, I enjoyed it immensely and loved the actor's performances dearly.8/10", "Not Taratino's finest hour.....": "Anyone who's saying this is Tarantino's best movie. give me a god damn break!!!\nThis entire film is a complete nonsensical mess. The old 60's retro setting is decent and it works but the problem is all the scenes have no relevance to each other there's no rhyme or reason as to why the next scene is suddenly happening, there's barely any plot whatsoever, even Brad and Leo weren't at their full potential They're ok but nothing like what we've seen in past movies of those two... Not to mention this film is almost 3 hours long with what I can only describe as the most ridiculous ending imaginable. like damn! Way to bore your audience to death Quentin! you really nailed it this time!", "Good!": "Brad Pitt deserves his Oscar win! He did a fantastic job!", "Bring a pillow..": "QT's ninth installment and hopefully his last, is the crowning of a legacy that after Pulp Fiction, should sadden any movie lover.With no story to tell, the film is nothing more than an expensive, well produced brain fart, made without any peer review, story arc, editing or green lighting process. It's a joke on the society we currently live in, with glorifying reviews from people who obviously couldn't tell the difference between quality and pulp. People who give this a ten star review but indicate they were bored with the movie. As a culture, we have reached a total dead end here.The film glaringly lacks the most basic feats that make any film passable - pure amateur hour- yet scores an 8 on this website, as I write this.Either people are as dumb as they come and are completely out of tune with reality, or 90% of these 10 star reviews were created by bots.Whatever it is, the joke's on all of us.Just depressing, really..", "If you love turtles, you'll love \"Once Upon a Time\"": "Starts slow finishes strong, that's it in a nutshell. It's definitely worth seeing if only to join in on the debate that's sure to follow this one. There is a distinct after taste that you're not sure is something you want to experience again. However, I've got a feeling \"Once Upon a Time\" will be an acquired taste. It just may be the performances by DiCaprio and Pitt are so compelling that they overcome the laboriously slow first half of this upside down historical fiction comedy drama. It finally gets going about half way through and puts the peddle to the metal the last 20 mins. You'll find the ending very satisfying with its revisionist history plot twist. While writing this review, I upgraded my rating from a 6 to a 7 which I'm pretty sure, if they're honest, will be the same feeling those who rated it below a 7 will have. If I keep writing I may give it an 8, for the ending alone.", "Tarrantino at his absolute best": "An absolute masterclass in film making from Tarrantino. Right up there and beyond his previous best. Leo and Brad are brilliant both together and alone, Margot plays a wonderfully lovable character and in true Tarrantino style, everything looks and sounds perfect. His attention to detail is fantastic. Hilarious, Brutal and a totally compelling watch from start to finish.", "Masterclass filmmaking.": "Every shot, every frame is compelling. The acting down to the bit parts are flawless. DiCaprio will win Best Actor for a clinic he puts on. And only QT could do what he did here. Easily up there with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Easily. Brilliant, shocking and Hilarious. Bravo.", "best movie 2019": "Probably one of tarantino picks,brilliantly built and writen.absoulutly amazing played by all the actors, specialy by de caprio , pitt ,robbie and my favoirite bruce dern .\ntarantino wrote a cinematic fantazy as a child who grew up hearing about the massacre of tate he give us the ultimate catarzis to rescue and change history. great movie", "A movie about absolutely nothing.": "I was waiting and waiting for the usual Tarantino spectacle but literally nothing happens until the last 10 minutes.I have never been this disappointed with a movie I've been longing for. Just wow. In aw. What a piece of garbage.", "Tarantino has created one of the greatest films ever made": "OUATIH has cemented Tarantino for the 9th time as one of the greatest writers/directors of our time and this might be his best film to date, or at least his most mature", "Tarantino's getting older": "Each time I get excited about new Tarantino movie I get my hopes up a little higher and each movie since gorgeous Inglorious Basterds disappoints me in a small but not deadly way. This time my expectations were also high because it's Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt finally teaming up together to work with the master and, what do you know, I was left a little disappointed but it has nothing to do with my high hopes: Quentin is simply changing, he doesn't make movies by the blueprint - he just tells us what he thinks is needed to be said, that's all.\nThis time it's late 1960s, the beginning of the New Hollywood era and in the center of the story there is the struggle of two buddies trying to stay in business, stay relevant and stay friends. What differs Once Upon A Time from the rest of Quentin's filmography is perhaps the lack of depth of characters and his masterful dialogues - the things we grew to adore so much. Instead Tarantino uses imagery, old-fashioned cameras, superb soundtrack and a whole lot of 60s nostalgia to tell his story right. By the end of this slowly developing movie he finally gains on speed and goes full steam Tarantino concluding his ninth movie to a perfect ending. I may have missed out on tons of witty, eloquent dialogues but I sure didn't miss remarkable performances, wonderful score and music and one of a kind touch of Mr Tarantino's talented hand on this great motion picture.", "Go see this movie! NOW": "Great homage to the golden Hollywood era. I really enjoyed every minute of this movie. Tarantino once again showed, how good movies should be made. Some say, you are working your way through the ending, but it is quite the opposite: the ending ist the grand finale of this masterpiece and you're sad, as soon as you see the credits, that you have to pay again, to take this rollercoaster ride once again.", "What the hell is this?": "DiCaprio is Dalton, some second-rate actor who's getting depressed for being type-cast as the disposable villain in TV show pilots. He keeps thinking that his career is over even though he keeps getting hired. Pitt is Boothe, Dalton's stunt double, entourage, confidant, assistant. Dalton is neighbors with Sharon Tate and her husband. She also gets some secondary roles and ends up pregnant. Boothe has a well-trained dog. One day he meets a hippie girl who takes him to Charlie Manson's compound where Boothe meets the rest of the girls and has a confrontation with one of the few guys there.All-these apparent stories meet up in an expected yet surprising climax. Apparent stories because they aren't really stories, there is no arc to the script nor to any of the characters' lives. All Once Upon a Time really is is a series of lazy skits: Let's put DiCarprio in a black-and-white Western. Lets put him in a Western in color. Lets put him in Nazi-themed movie. Let's write some pointless role for Al Pacino. Let's cast the brother/cousin/relative of so-and-so in the role of historical so-and-so. OK. All of course with the obligatory-for-Tarantino crap music. This movie could perhaps be impressive if it were Tarantino's first movie, as the trivia here says, a love letter to LA/Hollywood (yuck), by some rookie filmmaker trying to establish his bona-fides as a committed movie-buff. But coming from the guy who did Kill Bill and most importantly Jackie Brown, Once Upon a Time is an embarrassment. DiCaprio is likeable enough but he keeps getting these same work-intensive roles, it really doesn't matter anymore what way they dress him up. Pitt gets the the more interesting role here, but here too as in other instances, the movie hints at something developing but then completely failing to deliver.On to the few pluses. It's got Margot Robbie. Looks like Tarantino finally developed a good taste in women. There are also a couple of cute hippie chicks. And a dog who for once doesn't die in a movie. There's also an amazing star-making performance by Julia Butters.At nearly three hours this movie is a drag. It's got almost no humor, violence, zero nudity, or thrills. It's not entirely insufferable, but damn, what a self-indulgent (even for Tarantino and Hollywood) piece of junk and a giant waste of resources and talent on absolutely nothing and that goes nowhere in a crawl.", "This movie requires a second viewing": "Typical of most 3 hour long movies, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood requires a second viewing. The first time I watched it I missed out on a lot because I could only focus on what I wanted to happen next. Like \"when does Sharon Tate get murdered?\" Or \"When are they going to stop talking about Brad and Leo's characters\". I'm sure that's what a lot of you were thinking, and that's why you were so bummed about the length/pace of the movie. As was I on the first watch, and I gave it a 7/10 only because I really enjoyed the final scene that much. This movie upon second viewing made me appreciate the entire crew's effort with rebuilding 1960s Hollywood. That's not to say I have the slightest clue what it looked like back then since I'm only 22, but it still looks completely different from today and QT is known to love that era. Leo puts in such an incredible performance all the way through the film and so does Brad. All their reactions feel so genuine, and that's why they make me laugh so hard every time I watch this movie. Although I think Leo gets the upper hand because he isn't from the south like Brad Pitt is. As someone from the south I can say 100% without a doubt Leonardo DiCaprio killed that accent. He even consistently kept a stutter every time his character \"Rick Dalton\" was not acting. I also have to say they did a wonderful job showing the Manson family and why they would be so annoying to normal/older folk at the time. They drag out sentences and they are all dirty as hell. Even if these folks weren't the typical hippies they were portrayed to be in the film, the movie isn't supposed to be entirely accurate hence the \"Once Upon a Time...\". The only thing that QT didn't completely nail is what Sharon did all day in the second act. The two other main characters both do exciting stuff (Rick Dalton acts and has like 3 mental breakdowns, and Cliff fixes Rick's satellite, has a 25 minute flashback scene, and meets all of the Manson family). Sharon just wakes up, plays a kickass record, picks up a random hitchhiker, goes to a library, then watches her own movie at the a theater. The one thing that stood out about Sharon is that she is extremely sweet and charitable. It seems like this was either intentional to show us how innocent and sweet she was compared to the old school cowboy actors, or unintentional due to the fact that a lot of her storyline was edited out for runtime (Speculation on my part). If QT would've maybe spent more time with Sharon Tate instead of giving Brad Pitt's character all that time in the flashback and at the ranch, then this could've been an equally good but very different film. I really, really love when Cliff goes to spawn ranch, and the flashback scene. So it could go either way and the movie would still be a ten. One more thing, I absolutely LOVE the scene at the end of the day in the second act where the sun sets and that song kicks in. It shows Timothy Olyphant's character hopping on a motorcycle and driving home, Rick and Cliff driving home, and Sharon driving home. The song that plays is so perfect, and the way it is shot makes me feel so safe and cozy. But that's it, I give it a 10/10 after watching the movie 3 times and I never expected that after the first viewing.", "Nothing happens": "Long boring movie, where nothing happens.\nBoring characters, no development.", "Why ?? Why ?? QT": "Seriously, i was soooooooo waiting for this to come out.... Only to find out that you used fake characters, saw manson for 2 seconds and changed history???? Arent you the same guy who showed use violent be headings in kill bill and a guy's head getting blown off in pulp fiction???? What the hell??? Maybe its time to hang it up Quentin..", "A masterpiece of capturing a time and place": "Never been much of a fan of DiCaprio, but this is by far his best performance, in QTs reimagining of a specific time and place, which he renders beautifully in his supposed penultimate film. To say too much would do a disservice to those who haven't seen it. But the QT magic is in full effect. A masterwork. Cinema at its finest.", "Once upon a time in Hollywood - The golden age of Hollywood, struggling to cling to recognition - essentially what you might expect from a Tarantino movie": "Bloody gory violent drama, very loosely based on some actual events.Revolves around two men (in particular) and their friendship. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, a decaying actor, and Brad Pitt, as his quietly confident stunt double, driver, and general gofer Cliff Booth.The chemistry between these lead actors and their dark witty banter is a highlight. Set in 1969, Los Angeles. The way they've created the period scenery is an enormous practical achievement.The movie highlights the golden age of Hollywood, the film makers and the elite acting stars, either struggling to cling to recognition or as new rising stars.Very stylishly shot with extravagant scenes and some moments of brilliance.\nThe ending (especially the last 20mins) is very violent, and exactly what you might expect from a Tarantino film. Recommended.", "This was tough": "While the acting was phenomenal the story was well below average. This a story for a very specific target audience that didn't include myself. Even with a fast paced ending, it wasn't enough to save a rather dull film.Every part of me expected to be amazed with this film but I instead felt very let down and just plain bored.", "In my opinion Tarantino's best film, mild spoilers(nothing too plot specific).": "While yes that might be controversial to say, I still rank Pulp Fiction above it because of the amount of cultural significance it holds. I would 100% say this is his best modern film, and also his modern masterpiece.\nThe film is heavily layered with references, and symbolism. Especially during the first act, to someone who doesn't understand the references and homages it might be boring. But I was completely engaged. I can only review this as a fan of the director, the medium and the actors in the film.\nEach shot was carefully chosen, from westerns to horror. I honestly believe he saw the original Hills Have Eyes while writing the screenplay. The cinematography was beautiful, I tried my best to carefully analyze each scene.\nBrad Pitt played his role beautifully, representing an alpha male. As Cliff the stuntman, Leo's stunt man to be exact.\nWhile it might be cliche' it truly is his love letter to Hollywood, with Sharon Tate representing everything \"pure\" about Hollywood. The real life tragedy add's a lot of emotional weight to the film. Every scene is filled with dread, knowing what happened to Sharon in real life.\nLeonardo Dicaprio, is an aging actor who in my opinion represents Quentin Tarantino himself. An aging man who is fighting to stay relevant and great while the critics tear him apart. There are particularly touching scenes between him and a young actress, where Dicaprio's acting chops make you believe every second of it.\nThe antagonists are Manson's disciples and fill every scene with tension, like an 80's slasher film. And in my opinion they represent everything Tarantino hates about the modern film industry and everyone in it.\nThe film is a great arthouse film, a great homage film, a great spaghetti western, a great comedy, a great gore-fest, a great Tarantino flick and a beautiful tribute to not only Hollywood's great era in the 60's. But also the symbol of it all, Sharon Tate(R.I.P.) who Margot Robbie played with great nuance.\nThis film is worth every penny, watch it in theaters before it's too late.\nIt will be considered one his top 3 films in 10 years.\nThis film will stick with you, the more you think about it. The more you unravel.", "That was the worst movie ever!": "Would you all have watched that if Taranino hadn't direct it?\nUnless DiCaprio or Pitt nobody would have watched it and that's the truth.\nAll reviews you all give should be about film not about how good DiCaprio was or not.\nI can't even describe that film, I don't know what it was really about. Every character had their own story but those stories wasn't even that interesting.\nThe truth is that this movie is without sense.", "Enjoyable but you need to understand the back story.": "Some will say that this is an over long film that lacks a plot, and without some knowledge of the Tate-LaBianca murders I can see why that may be the case.But, if you understand the backdrop you will realise Tarantino brilliantly uses the first 2 hours of the movie to lay the foundations to a big question - what if Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel (the 3 who committed the murders in real life) went to the wrong house?What if they stumbled across characters like Rick (DeCaprio) and Cliff (Pitt) on that fateful night instead?The answer is a compelling, funny and moving last 30 minutes of the film.The cinematography and acting is also top class.", "Quentin Tarantino's worst movie thus far.": "80% of this movie is yet another dig into the slams and jabs of what goes wrong and right for actors in the process of their careers. The problem with that - the Cohen Brothers did a much better job of that in the movie Hail Cesar. The remaining 20% takes a tongue-in-cheek-look at Sharron Tate and Charles Manson's 'Family'.What's the matter with Quentin, did he suddenly go pussy on us in the telling of this story? What the hell is this all about? He wants you to somehow feel good about allowing Sharon Tate to live at the end? What a waste of two hours and forty minutes. There is no 'grit' in this movie. There is no 'street hard' dialogue to cling to. There are no original characters in this, save for Cliff Booth. Unfortunately, Cliff is just a sub plot in the whole scheme, and just played as a resurrected Lt. Aldo Raine character. Let's get to the rat-killing (the only gritty scene in the movie).What went right?\nMike Moh nails Bruce Lee! Mike's voice and portrayal of Bruce Lee is better than any other on film. Leonardo DiCaprio (the main focus) is very good as the struggling-actor role, but totally unnecessary as a plot for the movie. The character Rick Dalton doesn't add anything to the story, other than Leonardo acted well doing it. Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth is the only character you really care about, though we've seen this Pitt character before (see below). The 10-minute scene at the Spahn Ranch, which has Cliff Booth pitting (pun intended) wits against the Manson Family. The Spahn Ranch scene is heads and tails the ONLY nail-biting scene in the movie. A few decent cameos (particularly Al Pacino & Kurt Russell), but you quickly forget about them once they're off-screen. Could've done this movie in 1:10, just to ensure you included some of the better BS scenes, and to toss in the few worthy cameos. Nice old cars. A decent cigarette ad during the credits - though even that was too long, as Tarantino should've left out the whole complaint afterwards, by Rick Dalton (just another hint that Quentin is getting pussy on us and doesn't want to 'promote' smoking, even though he fills his films with more tobacco then you can harvest in all of Cuba!)What went wrong?\nBoring. Twenty seconds of a worthy eyebrow raise - followed by twenty minutes of crap. It's an hour and a half too long. Brad Pitt is just playing Lt. Aldo Raine once again, with the same mannerisms, voice inflections and sarcastic glances. The scenes involving Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen and Rafal Zawierucha as Roman Polanski, leave you scratching your head with a bewildered 'what the hell did we see that for?' Ten minutes of a party scene at the Playboy Mansion - huh - why??? You never care about Margot Robbie's depiction of Sharron Tate, because we all know what happens to her in real life. Let's also not forget that Sharron Tate was never an A-list actress. If not for getting killed in the crime of the century, it's doubtful she'd ever be remembered. As a matter of fact, the whole Tate-Murder-Influence in this picture was worthless and an utter waste of film (save the afore mentioned scene at the Spahn Ranch). Unfortunately, Quentin's true-life youthful crush on Sharron Tate, dominates this movie. Take all of Sharron Tate's influence on this movie, and you end up with something much more appealing and Tarantino-esque. If you want to tell the Tate murder - tell the Tate murder, which is what we were all waiting for. If you want to remake Hail Cesar, you get a worthy-effort nod, but adding in the Tate-Manson angle, just sank this film.Go back to re-making movies Quentin, your latest 'original' stuff, sucks.", "Outstanding masterpiece": "This is a very well built movie, with very good characters and solid story lines. There are several different movies within the film.Brat Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are at their best. You are able to empathize with them from beginning to end.Tarantino is an artisan that has delivered again a masterpiece.The ending is superb.", "Triple-speed is not fast enough": "After 15 minutes switched to double-speed. After another 10 switched to watch at triple speed. Glad I did. Saved me tons of time. Curious how people could sit through this crap for 3 hrs in the theaters.", "I am sorry but...": "The best thing is the music and the ending. It's not that a movie just has to have scenes like the movie ending, but I have no idea what the director wants to tell us about the rest of the movie.\nI am really confused and do not understand the nomination.", "A self-indulgent mess...replete with cliches...": "...that starts poorly and ends with QT's gratuitous gore superimposed on infantile fantasy. The fact that the cinema world seems to like it says so much about \"Hollywood\" and the sad state of movies these days.", "Rating: A-": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Quentin Tarantino is one of the best filmmakers of all-time. He has undeniable talent behind the camera, and his movies are fated to leave a mark in each year they're released. In addition to that, he's also an extraordinary screenwriter, as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proves once again. His knowledge of the early decades of film is vast, so every feature he produces is always going to be filled with references to those \"fairy tale\" years. And that's precisely what this movie is: a fairy tale in Hollywood, hence its title. Let me just leave this here right off the bat: I'm not going to address any controversy surrounding this film (namely, the whole Bruce Lee depiction and the Manson Family, in general), as I'm always fair and impartial to the movie I'm reviewing. Moving on ...My knowledge of the 60s isn't that good. Obviously, I know the whole Sharon Tate story, as well as the famous Manson murders, but when it comes to actual films from that decade, well ... Probably, I only know a few by name, a classic scene, or a memorable soundtrack. Tarantino uses his large runtime to place tons of references to that period, and that's one of the reasons the first act of the movie drags. There's a lot of time spent with characters just driving cars while listening to music (references in the songs), wide shots of the city as they drive by (references in the buildings), or even just playing an LP and dancing to it (reference in the songs, again).I understand that these mean something, but if they don't develop the character in any way, then these are just Easter Eggs and have no impact on the actual narrative. The first hour or so is filled with sequences which sole purpose is to show how much Tarantino knows about that time, and there's nothing wrong with it, as long as it tells a story. That's the second issue I have with the first act: it takes too long to establish its characters, and there's no apparent objective within the story. It feels like a person just strolling around with no destination, which in itself isn't a bad thing. But if you put together repetitive sequences plus a story that no one knows where it's going or how it connects to the only thing people are actually expecting (the Sharon Tate event), then you'll bore the hell out of the audience (a lot of people constantly left my theater to get more food or something, and they weren't in a hurry).Nevertheless, from the moment we start understanding who Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are, what they do, what they did, and what they want with their lives, then the film becomes incredibly captivating. It's definitely a character-driven story. It's a fairy tale where Rick tries his best to overcome his own personal issues to be the very best movie star, after being on an exponentially negative path. Cliff, as his stunt double, lives off of his buddy by doing everything he needs around the house and everywhere else. These two are inseparable, and their scenes are always filled with laughter and joy, even in the darkest moments. OUATIH works because of its beautifully-written characters.If you don't care about them, then you won't enjoy the film at all. In addition to this, if you don't know anything regarding the art of filmmaking, then you'll probably hate it since it will become extremely dull. It's one of those movies that anyone can like. However, for someone who knows and understands how films are made, it will always be a better time at the theater. You can love this movie, sure. But if you love filmmaking and you have knowledge of its techniques, you'll love it even more. There are so many technical achievements worthy of appreciation that I can't get to all of them, so I'll just address two of my favorites. The first has to be the black-and-white flicks inside the actual film. Putting Leonardo DiCaprio acting on classic westerns with over-the-top performances is an absolute delight. Watching those features in a 4:3 black-and-white screen, filled with classic sound effects, and cheesy one-liners ... Wonderful.The second allows for my favorite scenes of the whole movie: the extensive one-take dialogues. I mean, 10 or 15-minute sequences where DiCaprio just gives it his all. This is how every single film should be done. There's even a joke in the movie where Rick criticizes a particular type of filmmaking because they would film every character separately saying their lines and then editing them together. Unfortunately, that's how most features are done today. Therefore, from watching a simple dialogue scene with DiCaprio and Julia Butters (a 10-year-old little girl!) to a bar sequence which belongs to a movie Rick is filming (this one even has Rick asking his lines, and the camera has to go back to its starting point), everything with no cuts whatsoever ... What can I ask more from a director?!Obviously, if this is a character-driven narrative, the cast has to be genuinely compelling. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie ... I mean, do I even need to explain how phenomenal they are? DiCaprio proves once again he's one of the greatest actors of all-time. The ability that he has to put 200% in every single scene is unbelievable. I even started to tear up once his character is able to find his footing, solely due to the actor's performance. The Oscar nom is guaranteed, let's see about the win. Brad Pitt also has tons of nominations on his lap with an astonishing supporting display. He has a subtle performance, but it's pretty incredible how much he can transmit to the audience by putting (apparently) so little effort. Margot Robbie doesn't have that much screentime, but her character had the simple objective of showing how glamorous and dreamy an actress' life could be at that time, so she didn't exactly need to deliver her A-game.It's always good to see Al Pacino (Marvin Schwarz) on-screen, and I'm thrilled that Margaret Qualley (Pussycat), who I know from The Leftovers (one of the most underrated TV shows of the century), is finally getting some recognition. Technically, like I said above, it's close to a masterpiece. It's Tarantino, everyone knows what he's capable of, but having in mind his most recent features, it's a pleasant surprise and evidence of quality to the naysayers that he was able to produce a film with less bloody action. There are terrific demonstrations of great cinematography (Robert Richardson), and the editing is always impeccable in Tarantino's features (this time due to Fred Raskin). The score is addictive, and it carries a very significant role in the movie. I would say that if Tarantino was able to shorten its runtime and control its pacing better, this would be a technically perfect film.All in all, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isn't the best Quentin Tarantino's movie, but it's undoubtedly one of the year's best. Filled with award-winning lead performances (second Oscar for DiCaprio, please), this character-driven story is packed with references to the 60s which will be the divisive point in whether people will enjoy the film or not. Its first act is slow and takes too long to set up its story, but from the moment it's able to find its footing, it's an entertaining ride. If you love filmmaking and you know the insides of the art, Tarantino delivers a near-perfect technical production. Its alternate ending to real-life events is meant to be controversial, but for me, it's a vision of how everything should have happened if the world was fair or, indeed, a fairy tale ... in Hollywood.", "The warping mirror that is Hollywood": "I deliberately didn't read, listen to, or watch any reviews of this film before watching it. Let Tarantino tell me himself, let the movie speak. And so it does. Superficially, there is a tale of thwarted acting ambition, precarious employment, precarious life, gallows humour, trouble and strife (beautiful wives often coming with some hard to live with personal habits/traits they can do nothing about), the contrast between the 'haves' and have not's', outward appearances and the very different internal dialogue of certain characters...much more in fact. This, as we all knew before we stepped into the movie theatre, is a film we will revisit many, many times. It has plenty to keep us entertained for decades. Tarantino manages to conflate fact and fiction in a very entertaining, if gruesome, tale. His story references the Californian Tate and LaBianca murders, the Manson Family cult, the film careers of Burt Reynolds (who had, ironically been cast by Tarantino as the blind recluse at the Manson Family ranch, George Spahn, in this film but died) and Hal Needham, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood, a precocious child actor - possibly Jodie Foster etc, and all the while referencing his own (Tarantino's) filmography - e.g. the reading of pulp fiction, 'Dogs' , music references etc. I haven't awarded a 10 only because this film cannot convey it's full message in one sitting - this isn't necessarily a fault but, by the very fact that this film has to be seen more than once sets it apart. It's a grim tale with some horrid truths wrapped in it. This is not everyone's cup of tea. I enjoyed it though.", "It may be long but dont be afraid.": "All right, it's a long movie but it is worth every seconds.", "Why I love Tarantino!!!! And this film!!": "I am probably not going to say anything anyone else hasn't said, but this movie is the reason Tarantino is one of our most valued directors of our time. His theory of filmmaking is evident in all films - he is the the quintessential story teller. He takes his time with his film to tell a story, a probable story. My husband thought the ending of this film was a slap in the face to the victims. However, had we known who Charlie and his gang were capable of, wouldnt we all love the ending the film gave us? The same with Inglorious Basterds. Who wouldnt love to carve a swastika in a Nazi officer's forehead, on his way to \"living the American dream\"? Or to kill Hitler in a theater instead of his cowardly way out? A slave seeking rescue and revenge to save his wife? While the violence was pretty briefly brutal at the end, the storytelling, set direction, actors, cinematography...all of it make for a compelling, amazing, what could have been film. Though I was born in 1974, the Manson family, the era of 1969 Hollywood/LA, and the ebb and tide of cultural change taking place in the film industry, resonates with me still to this day, as this film definitely did. Excellent work, Tarantino. In case your read this, you are a reason to go to the movies!!!", "Still looking for the story": "This movie has no storyline, no plot.\nNothing happening at all. How is it so popular and has a high rating ? Many movies rated 5 or 6 on imdb are much less boring and enjoyable, despite not being amazing. But this movie is worse than just \"not amazing\". It is literally a way to waste two hours of your time.", "A new favorite Tarantino film": "I absolutely loved everything about this movie. DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie were outstanding. I don't consider myself to be a huge Tarantino fan but do like several of his movies and this movie was very well done. Some parts were funny, some action and some eerie. A must watch for movie fans.", "Back to the Past": "This Tarantino masterpiece is simply the best, better than all the rest, particularly if you grew up in the 50s, 60s and 70s which I did. As others who reviewed this have said, it's had not to review with spoilers but I'll try. The research done to create the film was obviously amazing! The music, the film/TV references and the history all contributed to make ... \"In Hollywood\" entertaining, shocking and reminiscent of reality back in 1969. The ending presented what we all wish could've happened in 8/69. I never saw it coming til the Spahn ranch car pulled away from Cielo Drive, leaving 3 not 4 to do the dirty work. And I'll stop here. I loved it!", "I would rate this the lowest of all Tarantino films": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres as soon as it came out. The storyline follows a former Hollywood star whose star has begun to dim. As his career begins to die so does the career of his stunt man. As they deal with their spiraling careers the rise of the Manson family is about to hit Hollywood.This movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino (Django) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed), Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Timothy Olyphant (The Crazies), Dakota Fanning (The Alienist), Al Pacino (Scarface) and Bruce Dern (The Hateful Eight).The characters are perfectly written, cast and delivered. The script is out of this world and this movie had a ton of potential. There were several worlds colliding in this picture during this time period that was fascinating. However, the conclusion of this film tried to be too much like Inglorious Bastards and have its own Tarantino spin on history that didn't work as well in this picture...it actually kind of ruined it for me. If they showed what really happened I think this would have been a far better film.Overall this is a very smart, well written movie that runs a bit longer than it needed to and has a mediocre to bad ending. I would rate this the lowest of all Tarantino films and give it a 6/10.", "There Is A Plot, And It's A Good One": "Even people who like this movie seem to think there's no plot. Now, with the risk of including Spoilers (although I won't be drawing arrows to or underlining plot points) the story of the two main protagonists, DiCaprio's down-and-out actor and Pitt's stunt double with nowhere to go but up, is not simply about, or even mainly about, their friendship. It is about what each of these two do in the face of adversity.\nThis is not a piece of nostalgia and I don't think there's even a moment of nostalgia in it. It makes use of a fairly distant, but not quite yet remote past. I was nine in the year this movie takes place. I remember this time vividly. In capturing certain aspects of this era, ONCE UPON A TIME prompts recognition in the minds of viewers who lived during that era. There isn't a single moment designed to make us yearn to return to 1969. Nor is this work designed to make us think it was a dystopian era. This may seem odd, given the focus on the Manson Family, but Tarantino is neither critiquing nor praising late '60s America. He is taking an event which is seared into the minds of people who lived at the time, an event which has become mythic; as central to American iconography as the legend of Jesse James; and made it the backdrop of a story about how individuals choose to use their freedom.", "Leo does not do anything but wonderful movies.": "The entire cast was wonderful, great sets, beautiful writing.\nI was born in the 80s and don't know much of anything about westerns or old Hollywood or even much about Polanski. Regardless of that, the film was very engaging and the character development was beautiful. It made me very interested to do plenty of research about the real-life stories the movie alluded to. Although Inglourious Basterds and Django are some of my favorite movies, sometimes Terantino can be \"too much\" as far as attention-seeking scenes/violence, but this movie was just the right amount for me.\nThanks for the awesome entertainment and keeping theaters alive :)", "A Great Film": "I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the theater but this movie was so much fun. The addition of Hollywood icons as well as one famous Hollywood mystery made this film stylistically stunning as well as satirical. For any film and Tarantino fans this is a must see.", "I must have missed something.": "Such a dire film from one of the best writers and directors around at the moment. I love most of his films but this was a rambling, pointless, utterly boring mediocre waste of time. I sat it out waiting for the punchline, the pay off, but nothing notable happens. With this writer/director and actors this should have been great, sadly it wasn't. Even worse the the overhyped The Irishman.", "Quentin Tarantino has a fetish for the 70s and feet": "There was no reason to have Margot Robbie's character in this movie. Other than having constant close-ups of her feet and legs, of course.", "Unbearably boring.": "No spoilers, for there is nothing to spoil. Nothing happens in this movie, really. One of the most boring movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot! This movie only got made because Tarantino was behind it, no other reason for its existence. Waste of time.", "QT- cutie- fails ....": "I usually like Tarantino films - but what this film does to 'actual celebrities of the 60's' by fictionalising them and creating a silly mockery of them is just beyond my ability to comprehend ... i have to say i was very annoyed by this over long boring film ... i also hope young people do not watch this and think that people like Bruce Lee were in any way like this in reality - it is total BS ...", "most definitely Tarantino": "He masterly created an air of suspense through a full 2.25 hours, hooked me the whole way. Then the awesome power finish to cap it off, as always.", "If Another Director Had Made This, It Would Have Been Panned": "I just finished watch Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. I had read all the spoilers, and criticisms ahead of the movie, and I have to say, the negative points were spot on. Too many pointless scenes (the scene where he talks to the child actress could have been edited out without losing her effectiveness in a later scene); all of the driving around should have been trimmed, it felt like filler.\nThe movie had very little or no focus. It kept doing different things, including silly little flashbacks and vignettes a la Family Guy, in an attempt to be humorous, but came across as flat and kept disrupting the momentum of the plot, which was barely there.\nI get the sense that Tarantino came up with the ending first, then had to fight to come up with a half decent story to fill in the first part of his idea. Because this felt like two different movies edited together, the first part the overly long, boring one. And then the last part set 6 months later where the Manson family is portrayed as a bunch of buffoons, instead of the evil doers they really were.\nAnd speaking of Manson, he only had one scene, and it actually made him seem very friendly. Then we never see him again. He's referred to by his first name every so often, but you never get the sense that he was in charge. Even at the end, the kids come up with their own ideas and plan, instead of the original. So, what was the point of that? And the ending just trivializes the tragedy of what really happened by turning into a comical piece of entertainment. Anyone who didn't know the actual details of the crime will be in for a shock when they read about it.\nThis movie would have been heavily criticized and panned had another director made it. But because it's Tarantino, people give it a pass. Ultimately, this will stand as one of Tarantino's weakest films. He's had three in a row now, and I fear for the Star Trek franchise with him at the helm of the next movie.\nOnce Upon A Time...Tarantino used to make good movies....", "This film is for students of Pop Culture": "As a Cultural Historian, I found this film fascinating. The set was a replica of a time long gone and should win an academy award for set design. If you enjoy films about friendship, endurance and hope, you may like this. If you are a Tarrantino fan, this is unlike anything he's done before. But for me, the late 60's film industry and the transformation of society alongside it was so entertaining. It is helpful to know details of both TV, film and historical events as it enriches your viewing experience. It's obvious that this is a personal story of Tarrentino's early influence on his art. I found the message that Hollywood shaped the violent tendencies of an entire generation while the studios amassed enormous wealth was interesting. The differentiation of the lifestyle of Hollywood Hills and the Manson Compound really reinforced the message. Thanks Mr Tarrentino for a History Lesson with a fairy tale ending", "Boring...as in nothing happens": "The lowest QT movie I have rated is 7/10 and the highest PF 10/10 so I like his movies. I'm not sure who this was made for, there is a little bit of action in the last ten minuets but definitely not worth the wait and to be honest they should feel ashamed how they showed what was a tragic part of Hollywood history. I give it a 4/10 because it was definitely well made and the acting was pretty decent. Honestly wish I'd watched something else.", "Ultimate revenge film": "Not as violent as Tarantino can sometimes be. Great acting. Satisfying ending.", "Thank You Mr. Tarantino!": "No one could have portrayed Hollywood in 1969 better as Quentin Tarantino! After I watched the movie there was just one thing I wanted to do: Invent a Time Machine and go back to 1969.\nI agree with the other reviews. You need to watch this movie more than one time to get all the many million references from that period of time. But honestly I don't mind watching it a thousand times. I would watch it just for the Flamethrower!\nI think this movie is very special because it felt like something completely different. At some points it felt like watching a movie in the movie and I forgot that I was watching another movie. I also loved the way that the 3 stories were connected to each other.\nOf course the acting was phenomenal! How can it not be with a cast like that? In my opinion Brad Pitt (Cliff Booth) was the highlight of the movie or you could say the comic relief part of it. From his fight with Bruce Lee to his LSD trip he was just FANTASTIC! What I liked about Rick Dalton played by Leonardo DiCaprio was his character evolution. It was so well done. You could really follow his development from the beginning to the end.\nAnd Margot Robbie played Sharon Tate so well! The scene in the movie theatre was just sooo sweet! AND of course how could I not mention Brandy the pitbull! I think it was one of the best dog performances in a movie.\nI was also very happy to see all the classic Tarantino elements. The foot shots were absolutely beautiful, all the drink shots made me so thirsty and the use of dogfood was just perfect. Pulp Fiction made me want to have a milkshake, Inglorious Basterds made me want a Strudel with cream, Django Unchained made want a beer and OUATIH made me just want to drink Margharitas and Bloody Marys.\nOf course the epitome of the movie was the ending. Never (even in Inglorious Basterds) have I laughed so much during an absolutely brutal and bloody scene. The entire audience was laughing while they were all screaming and burning. And THAT IS ART! Only Tarantino can change the course of history in a very humorous and satisfying way. BRAVO.\nPS: I was so happy that in the credits they made a commercial for Red Apple Cigarettes! Even if Rick thinks they're disgusting I WANT TO TRY THEM! :-)", "Definitely not Tarantino's best!": "I'm just gonna be clear and simple with my review.\nFirstly,I do not understand all the high reviews here,giving it 10 out of 10 is a joke!\nLike with Tarantinos flicks,he gets a little carried far away with the extent of dialogue.\nPersonally,I do not RATE Tarantinos movie that highly!\nHis talent is questionable.\nThe movie didn't make a hell of a lot of sense,it was slow,boring and very tedious.\nSimple!\n5 out 10!\nWould I give it a second viewing? Hell no!", "The Hills Are Alive With the Sounds of Quentin - Once Upon a Time in Hollywood": "This is the best film Quinton Tarrantino and Leonardo DiCaprio have ever done. It is also the best work that Brad Pitt has ever done. That being said, Tarrantino has never really made a legitimate film; but this is the closest he has come. He is getting better. It is a good period piece. DiCaprio can never be a macho actor even though he has tried a dozen times to do so. Even Marty couldnt convince the audience he was a gang leader in old New York. Lewis, yes, Decaprio? Please. He is more like that great funny guy who doesnt know where to find the hole for his motorcycle.. Pitt, on the other hand, has no problem handling the macho role. To his credit, DiCaprio does have a few good scenes (his missing lines rage and his bad guy satire); however, he gets bogged down in his other scenes. Pitt is consistently good in every scene he is in and will win the Academy Award this year for Best Supporting Actor. Amusingly enough, because the Academy outrageously omitted Adam Sandler for Uncut Gems from the nominations, Pitt could have won Best Actor in the category had he been nominated. But now that award will probably go to Phoenix for Joker. A wise decision to have him nominated for Best Supporting Actor. This film will not win Best Movie of the Year; that honor will go to 1917, which is already a classic. Best Director and Cinematography will also go to 1917. The only other possible winner might be Parasite, but not this amusing film. Tarrantino is getting better though.", "Delicious Homage, then Frantic Homicide!": "I loved this film! The first two hours was a sumptuous emersion into '69s whole Hollywood scene and its people. I could almost smell and feel the world Tarantino knitted around the viewer. The last 45 minutes gave a brief glimpse back to what QT does best, plus an alternative ending to a major event of that year. A wonderful film, great acting, Margot Robbie is utterly enchanting, and lovely mise en scene!", "For movie fans, period. I hate boring, and this was not that.": "You don't need to care about the '60's or boring slow movies to like this. If you like good dialogue and interesting scenes, YOU WILL BE ENTERTAINED.It would help to one piece of history:Charles Manson got some gullible kids to brutally kill famous director Roman Polanski's pregnant woman, Sharon Tate, and her friends by shooting and stabbing them to death. Horrific and extremely sad.", "Best film in 2019 so far and nothing will probably beat it": "Going in to see this film I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. The star was slower but don't let that scare you away, trust me it's worth it. For me definitely the best Bratt Pitt performance I saw (I didn't see all his film's to be fair). DiCaprio was also very and so was the rest of the cast. If your looking for a great film, you found it. Probably my favorite Tarantino film.", "A new age of Tarrantino": "I loved it. It was still clever and engaging and fascinating, the sound track was still out of this world, the script was still clever and humourous, but it seemed to be a different brand of Tarrantino. It wasnt as blood thirsty, the language, whilst your 5 year old cant watch it, wasnt as shocking as it has been in other films.\nBrad Pitt is outstanding. Margot Robbie is stunning. Leonard Di Caprio is amazing.\nIf you're expecting another Pulp Fiction, you'll be disappointed so take this as it is, a well written, incredibly directed film about Hollywoods golden era and you will love it!", "Awful": "Complete rubbish. Definitely one of Tarantino's worst films. The storyline was weak, and the fact that he took almost 3 hours to achieve an introduction with Polanski, actually with Polanski's wife was pathetic.", "Amazing!": "This movie is great! I watched it twice in cinemas and I loved it. For those who aren't very interested in movie history might get a bit bored in the first 2/3 of the film. But for people (like me) who just enjoy the technique behind the \"older\" movies will enjoy the first 2/3 of it the most. The last third was hilarious. Me and the whole crowd laughed so hard...thanks Tarintino for this masterpiece. Also a incredible acting by DiCaprio and Pitt. I also liked all other actors. Alpacino, Margot Robbie...oh I love her\ud83d\ude0d\nSo yeah you should definitely watch Once upon a time in Hollywood.", "Absolutely fantastic (but not everyone will think so)": "To put it simply, the first two hours or so meanders about through Rick's problems, his friendship with Cliff, and wildly entertaining personalities from the era (Bruce Lee, Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate.. ). This portion of the movie doesn't have a straight plot to follow and some viewers may not appreciate it. However, I would defend this segment as a stroll in the 1960's through movies and television. This is really a movie about movies/stars/Hollywood after all. It is nonetheless, very well put together.There is a generous portion of hippie punching, degradation and abuse (to put it lightly). Some viewers may not appreciate this.There aren't any strong female leads but Margo Robbie is excellent as happy, go-lucky starlet Sharon Tate. Some viewers may not appreciate this. I'm sure there will be no shortage of woke outrage that Robbie/Tate isn't deep thinking and.. 'powerful' (because you know, it's 2019).The key takeaway here: \"Once Upon a Time..\" is a buddy movie and it does feel targeted a bit toward men. There is definitely strong violence and a lot of derogatory language... in other words, a Tarantino movie.TLDR: Don't go to a Tarantino movie and rage about it being a Tarantino movie.", "ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR THUS FAR": "This is a movie that is not for everyone, since it is very slow and many scenes do not push the plot forward. I enjoyed the filler scenes, since they where all funny and explored the interesting characters of the movie. Speaking of funny, this movie has a great sense of comedy, with the climax making me and the entire theatre laugh out loud. All the performances are stellar (especialy Leonardo Decaprio and Brad Pitt) and give a special charisma to all the already great characters. The edditing and cinematography are great. You can see that this is a passion project, from how accurate the sets and costumes look. There are many details in the movie (like how the value of the dollar corespunds with the year) that make it feel more authentic. Some characters could have had more screentime, but I still highly recommend this incredible period-piece!", "A flame thrower is always useful": "This movie is a great revival of the late 60's in Hollywood. A period which seems strangely familiar but so different from what one can live today. And eventually, nos such a golden age as this could seem.\nA movie filled with many references of this period's culture (I would be proud to have catched hefl of them). Actors a incredible, especially Di Caprio that seem to actually BE Rick Dalton.\nAs for a Tarantino movie, there will be a bit of violence, but this is not what props this story... and it is just great !", "Honestly...Shame on you Mr.Tarantino...": "Honestly...Shame on you Mr.Tarantino...\nI've religiously followed all the films of Tarantino,having an opinion that he is the greatest director alive... What a disappointment with his new film... Actors are amazing,but the story...Cashing in on the tragedy of victims of the cult of Manson...Just simply sad...3 stars for amazing acting from main actors...The rest is just a horrible mistake...", "Perfect film that will appreciated in a few years just like Pulp Fiction.": "Tarantino connected a tragic event to fictional characters in a wish-it-happened reality and created a great film with awesome soundtrack and very funny scenes along with top quality performances from A-list actors. Cinematography and production design were truly impeccable, you feel like you really live in 1969 for 2 hours and 41 minutes.It's a well-made MOVIE literally about HOLLYWOOD of 1969.Actors,directors,stunt doubles, film making and on top of that the real tragic event of that year. Quentin connected all these perfectly.\nI can see why many people didn't love but I can't accept the fact that they don't admit or appreciate the film as of what it is and the reason it was made.If you say you love movies but you don't love Tarantino then you don't really love movies.I don't care if you consider yourself the biggest cinephile there ever was. If you can't understand his work you don't really care about quality movies and you should just keep watching marvel movies and fast and furious only.", "If it only ended like this in real life.": "I thought the film was an hour too long but I loved all the small touches such as Joanna Pettet visiting with her baby Damien and Sharon at the theatre. \"It is the girl from Valley of the Dolls. Not Patty Duke. Not the girl from Peyton Place.\"Normally I hate revisionist history, but I love this alternate ending.", "Best film this year": "Loved it lots. It goes together with Django and Inglorious Basterds. I loved the all characters, the cinematography, the vibe, the slow pace, the story. Al Pacino's character was the cherry on top. Brad Pitt will definitely win an Oscar for this film, as is Tarantino. What more to say? The last part was absolutely hilarious, we, the audience, laughed out loud... barely could stop laughing! It was awesome. And the ending was surprising, I was waiting for more haha, so even though it lasted almost 3 hours, it didn't feel like that. Loved it!", "Great Action From Beginning To End.": "Once upon a time in Hollywood there was a great director called Quentin Tarantino with great talented actors, grand actresses and impressive critics remarks about a perfect action movie from beginning to end. Rated R for Violence & Bad Language.", "8/10. Liked it. Quirky, different, well-acted, cool, and fun movie.": "This is definitely a good movie. I just got done watching it and enjoyed it. There's not really much to say about the plot that hasn't already been understood by the publicity, but a few things stand out.DiCaprio gives a stellar performance as a Western aging actor on the downswing of his career, with many memorable acting scenes, some where he is acting within his acting.Pitt is also very good in his role as DiCaprio's stunt double. Robbie is excellent as Sharon Tate, and the other smaller roles are all played good enough.The movie takes its time in building up, and I've seen some people complain it was slow or boring, but I'll be honest: while I noticed a couple of scenes dragged a little bit, I rather enjoyed it, and it didn't bother me, for the most part.I liked some of Tarantino's creative choices and nuances a lot, but I did feel like there may have been a few opportunities missed to make it even better. However, with limited time and editing reasons, surely only so much could make it into the movie.I wouldn't mind seeing more of Cliff Booth and Rick Dalton's adventures through Hollywood in 1969. This one took the audience through Bruce Lee and the infiltration of the Hippies, but it seems like there could be even more to their stories.It's a solid film, and like one person pointed out: in an age of comic books and remakes, because the movie suffices on all levels, it was a nice experience to see something original.7.5/10", "Worst movie of the millenium": "The movie is like outer space. There is no matter. Just hollow empty story with no point. Don't be fooled by all the 4/5 stars other people have rated the movie. They are too scared to admit they were so stupid to watch a stupid movie and have to show they spent their money & time wisely.", "One of the best Tarantino's ever.": "This film gets into the end of 60s Hollywood and the beginning of what many believe as the beginning of the downfall of television. The business did suffer greatly after the incidents depicted here.Tarantino is very good at showing what 60s Hollywood was like. Unfortunately, he is also very good at creating depictions of Manson family members. These are people that initially look OK, a few moments later you realize they are not.So on one hand this film is highly entertaining and very revelatory about how things are with the television and movie business, and even the relationships between actors and the people that are their stunt doubles.On the other hand it is extremely disturbing and creepy.But rather than being a bunch of short vignettes that may or may not have something to do with each other, this is actually a film showing the collusion of several people.Margot Robbie looks and sounds and moves exactly like Sharon Tate. The people that they have playing people like Steve McQueen and Roman Polanski, look and sound like them. Especially the actor playing Steve McQueen, Damian Lewis. And Luke Perry in his last ever movie role before he passed plays the actor that played \"Scott Lancer\".This film is a lot more seamless than Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, it slides from one scene to the next and everything is interconnected.Of course if you keep your eyes peeled you will notice several favorite Tarantino actors like Michael Madsen, Zoe Bell, Kurt Russell.This is a wonderful monument to a very interesting time.", "Finally...a movie for \"grown-ups\"!": "GREAT film, one of the finest I have ever seen. Finally...a movie for adults to enjoy that is NOT same lame sequel, action, animated, or just plain DUMB movie! Quentin Tarantino has without a doubt proven once again why he is probably the finest director of his generation. There are not enough superlatives to describe the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio & Brad Pitt...and I expect both of them to not only have Oscar nominations, but for ONE of them to walk away with the Oscar for Best Actor! This isn't a review of the movie so much as it is me just putting in my raves about it, but I WILL say that I definitely clapped and cheered in the theatre at the scenes that those of you who already saw it will know what I'm talking about!!", "Quentin Finally Gets it Right!": "Tarantino finally gets a specific genre in film cinema correct! Once Upon a Time in Hollywoood hits the mood of life in '69 perfectly, the ambiance is spot on. Quentin pays homage perfectly to Sergio Leone films, Steve McQueen (as Bounty Law is based off of McQueen's 'Wanted: Dead or Alive' series), and to actors in that specific genre i.e. Harrey Carey jr., Warren Oates, etc. But Quentin also shows the actor incarnate in Dicaprio's Rick Dalton. How it is to have success and then to have it slip through your fingers, as every successful actor goes through it. Dicaprio nails it perfectly showing how sensitive and fragile all actors can be. Pitt's Cliff Booth is a dream role for Pitt as Booth is a little off, but super fun and very cool. Margot Robbie is fantastic as Sharon Tate.Also, Quentin does certain filming in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that mirrors Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America. And as Quentin pays homage to Leone and those Westerns, Quentin also pokes fun at them as well, like how a good friend will bring you up, but also bust your chops.An overall brilliant composition of that film genre and time period, leading to a no holds barred ending in which we all would have preferred. This film is brilliantly written and absolutely hilarious, Quentin's funniest film to date (in close 2nd, 3rd, and 4th - Four Rooms, Pulp Fiction, and True Romance).This is truly Tarantino's Opus and it will be nominated for many academy awards come Oscar season. Tarantino nailed it!", "Aesthetically pleasing but lacking brains or a heart": "An aging actor and his best friend/stunt man try to come to terms with how Hollywood is changing into something they no longer recognize and are no longer central to.There is a mix of fact and fiction throughout; some people real, some made up; some events real, some made up. Visually this film is breath-taking at times, some lovely scenery, and some gorgeous retro costume, sets, and vehicles. The actors in the film carried off their roles quite well, albeit without being engaging enough for me to really care about too much. Pitt and DiCaprio's bromance drives the film forward, and Margot Robbie provides a more light-hearted side story.So why the poor rating for what some people are calling a 10 out of 10 film?Well, unfortunately I did not really enjoy this long winded \"what if\" look at Hollywood for a few reasons. Just to be clear, I am not \"new audience\" and I do enjoy some of Tarantino's other films, this however was a struggle for me.I felt that the film was trying too hard to be cool and culturally relevant. It came across as aesthetically pleasing, but with truly little substance. A summary which pretty much explains how I felt about the entire film.... it looked good, really really good at times... but it didn't have substance, it lacked a real heart or brain, or in this case, a decent plot. It was just lots of beautiful things thrown together without ever going much further. If it has of been a \"paint by numbers\" film, then it had all the elements it needed to make an extravaganza.... but the final masterpiece that was put onto canvas almost felt too manufactured and forced. Sure, there was a little character development from DiCaprio; but not enough to care or show growth. Sure, there was action in it from Pitt, but not relevant to the overall vehicle of the movie. Sure, there was sex appeal, but it did not contribute anything, it just was.\"Once upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is a really long film with a small climax that is far-fetched in the context of the rest of the film. In fact, the climax of the film it the one true Tarantino signature - you watch that part and you know you are watching one of his movies. The 2 hours prior to that though, it would be hard to see clear signatures of his famed auteurship.I was left unfulfilled and robbed of the time that I could have been watching other films. I find it hard to recommend this film and staggered and bemused by the amount of people who have awarded this a perfect 10 out of 10. If you have seen this, ask yourself some serious questions:\nWould this have as much fanfare and prestige if it were not a Tarantino movie?Would you have looked at the film twice if it did not have De Caprio and Pitt in it?Would you have rated it as highly if Margot Robbie's legs were not on display? (Just to clarify, that is not me being sexist for objectifying female anatomy, look at other reviews and count how many times you see the aforementioned legs mentioned as a driver to a decent rating!)If the answer to the above is probably not - then how can this be the film of 2019? If the answer to the above is yes, then be careful with that growing nose.Not the best film I have ever seen, not the worst film either. An exceptionally long and at times disengaging film. Lots of beautiful aesthetics, no heart or decent plot. A 'just is', \"what if\" film that will surely divide opinions that I personally did not enjoy greatly. 4 out of 10.", "Waste Of Valuable Time": "Trash. Since when did abysmal storytelling figure center stage in people's minds? This film is painful to watch. I just don't even understand how this could be up for an Oscar unless it's just about name association.", "Once upon a time a director.....": "Vanished up his own arse for 161 minutes and stayed there. Plotless, witless drivel that even Leo and Brad cant save.i could go on but there's no point. Retire QT, you haven't made anything watchable since Inglorious Basterds.", "Oooh God! I love this film!": "This is something new in the history of cinema.This film literally turned the current era of films, where senseless action films with a multi-million budget and stupid banal comedies without a soul soar all around, giving us new colors and a newer format. The film takes place in 1969, where we manage to live and plunge into the atmosphere of those times. You do not just watch another movie with a 3-hour duration, but you live, you feel the spirit of that time with every cell and nostalgia does not leave you even after leaving the cinema.You literally breathe the same air with the heroes and after watching the movie you are surprised at the fact that you find yourself sitting on an armchair somewhere in a movie theater in a completely different time. This is so well saturated with the atmosphere of Golden Hollywood that you regret that you were born at the wrong time.", "Even gigants fall, and they fall tall": "One reviewer sad it felt like for the most part like a bleak coulisse from 70-ties and the rest 15min of action, I have a to agree. The dialogue was empty at least for mr Q standards, a thing that is his usually strong spot. Usually, atleast from my prospektive he creates sceanes that tells a story for it self ( aphorism) this only to put the the story forward. The caracters are not as intressting some how as he use to make them, the acting though is great. First time i ever have been a little dissapointed, or a lot. I thoughed this would be his signature movie witch it's obviously not. I think the bucket is empty.", "Best Movie Ever Made or written in Hollywood for decades": "I don't care much for Tarantino but this movie was perfectly made, a real movie with out all the Hollywood pandering, a perfect fiction story loved this movie it's what should be coming from Hollywood..Brad Pitt, Leo they were at their absolute best. Love this movie. I can't stress enough.", "HORRIBLY DULL!!!!": "I am flabbergasted by all the 10's this movie has received!! 2 hours and 35 minutes of total boredom! 5 minutes of action. Absolutely no story whatsoever. The directing, costumes, set design, and soundtrack were good, but none of that matters when there's no plot. Don't waste your money!!!", "Wasn't that entertained": "This is the second time a QT film has disappointed me. My main complaint is that it is several \"day in the life\" vignettes, but not an actual story. I kept waiting for an inciting incident. However, this might change with repeat viewings, because I recognize everything else about it is top-notch. Obviously, Tarantino is a director who can make exactly what film he sets out to make. I just didn't see any reason for making this one.", "Haters clearly don't know the story": "Reading the sub-8 reviews, it's blatantly obvious that the authors know nothing of what really happened in August of '69 on Cielo Drive.", "Hollywood Fiction": "This is a film in which Tarantino combined two other films: Inglourious Basterds and Pulp Fiction.

You get a nice impression of the sixties not only because of the atmosphere yet because of real events merging into a fictional story. The outstanding scene in a scene moments brought me to laugh and amazement. You truly need to see this movie as art and bring patience along as it also requires your close eye to detail and you will appreciate this artwork.Spoiler: I love what Tarantino has done to the entire movie as he used cinema to bring a murdered person(s) back to life and reveals the murderers as weak, pitiful monsters which weren't \"successful\" in their inhumane plans and got to suffer what in real life they have done to others.

QT takes what you think you know and tips it on its head ala Inglorious Basterds.

In the end, after watching the whole thing and disliking aspects of it (mostly sound design, the good awful editing choices during most of the movie, and the blank and LONG scenes of people riding in cars), I could piece together that this is another alternate universe like Inglourious Basterds. Still, the way things are presented, the point of many scenes and pacing is just.. wrong.\nIt's a beautifully shot film, full of care and love for the physical space it was recorded in. Almost no digital manipulation of streets, cars, stores and others. But I feel like it was butchered in editing (jumpy cuts, some weird musical choices, and angles). At a point, you even realize you are watching TV (an old one in a third of the screen) for a couple of minutes during a movie!And the best performance + lines are given to a child that appears for 5 minutes tops!! Second best is a dog. Still, Brad and DiCrapio do a great job with what they are given.. but it's still long and uninteresting (specially at the beginning), which is weird for Tarantino.

The latter distinction belongs (more or less) to the second-fiddle H0LLYWOOD female, who has her entire face mashed in by a full can of canine chow being fired into it like a fastball. (After just ten minutes of noisy suffering, this wailing banshee is mercifully dispatched with a flame thrower.) Though some might argue that the Alpo-visage chick's fate pales in comparison to that of her female companion (a demise involving being partially EATEN by a bulldog, THEN having her mug shattered and flattened against eight extremely hard and hateful objects), let's not forget about the harpy battle-axe \"Janet,\" who only has the side of her car caved in when \"Rick\" tosses \"Cato\" halfway through it.", "I wanted to like it": "The movie is beautiful but that's about it.

My only criticism is that a few of these are a bit too long. I found myself wanting to zone out. Leonardo delivers a superb performance but it's Brad Pitt who steals the show. He's as charming as ever. I watched this movie after the hype and anti-hype...reading most of the reviews....even the ones that contained the spoilers.

Tarantino pls don't stop at 9......", "Exhilirating details, but ultimately exhausting": "Spoilers at very end, clearly marked.1969 was a year of great turbulence with highs such as the Apollo 11 Moon landing and lows such as the escalation of the Vietnam war under the newly sworn in President Nixon. In August, the Charles Manson murders struck deep into the psyche of Los Angeles. Quentin Tarantino's ONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD takes place over a few days in 1969 months apart - February and August. It's a sprawling if ultimately exasperating film.\nRick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 40-something actor who once starred in a short lived Western TV series and a few features, but is now reduced to bit parts on other stars' shows. His best buddy is stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Rick's home in the Hollywood Hills happens to be next door to new tenant Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha) and his wife, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). One of the odd assortment of stragglers and wannabees who have hung out at the Polish Director's home in the past is one Charles Manson (Damon Herriman). Also, just drifting around town are some of Manson's 'girls' including one dubbed Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), who lures Cliff up to the old Spahn Movie Ranch where Cliff and Rick have shot pictures --- and, happens to be the Manson Family hang.But, ONCE isn't really concerned about plot, per se. Of the film's 161 minutes, only about half of it is (and even that may be generous). Tarantino and his collaborators including Cinematographer Robert Richardson (shooting on 35mm film), Production Designer Barbara Ling and Costumer Arianne Phillips have done a bang up job recreating the Hollywood of the late 60s - well, at least the version imagined by QT. While we hear a few seconds on the radio about Nam and the RFK assassination, it's really all about the Pop culture references. Virtually every major or cult film release in '69 seems to be cited at one point or another. Hit songs are strewn on the soundtrack. Posters, commercials, ads and merchandise are bandied about like some phantasmagorical eBay vintage store come to life. The war, civil rights protests, Stonewall, women's lib? Nah, no time for that (about as 'political' as the movie gets are Cliff and Rick putting down \"hippies'). Let's see a five minute montage of how a movie gets threaded into a projector in a Producer's (Al Pacino) home movie theater or fetish a needle drop on a turntable, instead.Pitt and DiCaprio play off their natural charms either hanging out together or separately. They inhabit the screen naturally even when a scene (or two or three...) is well past any point. Robbie isn't given much to do but seem winsome and perky. Mike Moh's Bruce Lee is an affront to the Martial arts legend (having worked with Lee's family and friends, this isn't the Bruce Lee they describe). The rest of the cast is fine doing the patented coy and arch QT thing, but the Manson family scenes are largely played straight (even if the actors aren't given room for genuine depth). Over-writing is a given with QT, but, here, the seeming inability to be willing to edit his scenes to a reasonable degree severely hampers the momentum. There are times one feels as if they are watching a movie with the DVD extras included IN the film. It's about footnotes more than an actual story. Some of the footnotes are a lot of fun, but it's at the expense of telling a gripping story. A good editor could cut the 2:45 film to under two hours and still keep most of the references.The above is unfortunate, because there was so much potential there for ONCE to become a truly enjoyable hang out picture. Just spending time groovin' to a fantasy version of the 60s. Of course, that only covers the first 3/4 of the film. There's still the already infamous ENDING to address.SPOILERS, of course, although anybody who is aware that the Manson killings are involved and has seen INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED or the overlong Samuel L. Jackson C-Sucker flashback in HATEFUL 8 will already have a pretty good idea of where this one is heading (once QT begged folks not to reveal the ending in Cannes, it was pretty easy to figure out).Still, final WARNING on SPOILERS:\n/Who would have thought that of all his contemporary filmmakers, that QT would devolve into another M. Night Shyamalan with his predictable 'twist' endings? It's become a joke and a self-parody at this point. Setting aside the ethics of this cockeyed alternate history, what's truly disappointing is that the Susan Atkins/Sadie character (Mikey Madison) sets up what could have been a powerful hard-hitting coda when she talks about her idea to kill the people who taught them to kill! But, if we've learned anything over the nine feature films in QT's career is that meaning ALWAYS takes a back-seat to saying, doing or looking \"cool\". He is the low priest bowing to the altar of \"cool\" above (or below) all else. And, so, the yahoos in the crowd get their chance to hoop and holler as the bad guys get theirs. It's a cheap trick, that if a \"Quentin SMITH\" had directed the film, nobody would take seriously, but the QT cult is mighty strong.\nEven considering the fantasy construct it's also curious that QT alters one critical point - the Linda Kasabian character (Maya Hawke) DIDN'T drive away the night of the actual murders. She remained as a look-out. Also, Manson himself is curiously spared (perhaps we'll see his fate in the 9 hour DVD/Streaming cut that is sure to follow).", "Stunning.": "Screenplay, acting, capturing a recent moment.

Tarantino does it his way of course but it's ultimately more satisfying than what really happened. For all the violence in his films it's not as bleak as one would think.At the center he uses two fictional characters Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth to set things right and both are likely to have new breath into their careers as they now have a introduction to the new Hollywood. Without giving it all away I was actually impressed Dalton didn't take all the credit he really is loyal to his buddy Cliff Booth. It's actually Cliff Booth( Brad Pitt) who links the characters and events. Between him and Rick Dalton ( Leonard DiCaprio ) they prevent what we actually expected the end to be . Tarantino in his own way like the happy ending.Margot Robbie embodies Sharon Tate impeccably but it's more the essence of her than really knowing her as she has limited screen time and even less dialogue.The sets are incredible among the most realistically recreated of any movie.

I actually like all of his movies with the exception of the Kill Bill movies (but only because they're not my cup of tea). This movie had a similar structure and style to Inglorious Basterds and Django in the way that he factored in history and put a Tarantino spin on it.

Nothing really special. noone of my friends liked also the movie . 2 stars", "Tarantino's rambling love-letter to filmmaking doesn't entirely exclude his trademark violence": "Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood marks something of a departure for the director. Having made his name with a series of often notoriously violent films featuring anti-heroes or simply villains as protagonists, this most cinephile of filmmakers instead gives us something rather more frothy, with a lengthy and often rambling love tribute to the 1960s and the twilight of Hollywood's Golden Age, which blends fictional characters with historical ones and has more overtly comic moments than any of his previous offerings. Nevertheless, Tarantino hasn't completely abandoned his characteristic traits, since the film is set against the unpleasant backdrop of the Tate-LaBianca Murders and isn't entirely lacking the trademark violence for which he is known.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is largely a love-letter to filmmaking, and follows the fortunes of faded star Rick Dalton, who is relegated to playing villains in Western television series until he eventually finds happiness by learning to be an actor rather than a movie star. The film is part \"bromance\", with Dalton having a close friendship with his regular stuntman and war veteran Cliff Booth, whose friendship proves unshakeably loyal even when Dalton informs him that he can't afford his services anymore. Tarantino's screenplay is typically verbose and witty, and uses its central premise to poke affectionate fun at actors, acting and the movie industry in general, thanks to dialogue heavy scenes that sees the characters muse on all manner of topics. Tarantino has been doing this for years, but whereas in his previous films he has usually focused on social issues (usually dispassionately and without offering any solutions to the problems he explores), here he instead examines the mechanics of film of television. At times, he goes off on tangents: the controversial scene in which Cliff fights Mike Moh's arrogant Bruce Lee is completely extraneous to the plot, although also quite funny.The meandering story focuses so heavily on Dalton's career at times that Tarantino actually wrote several episodes of Bounty Law, an entirely fictitious Western television show that Dalton starred in; it's the sort of attention to detail that one expects and demonstrates boggling dedication by Tarantino to his work. This is not unusual: even Tarantino's detractors can't really argue that he does put a great deal of care into his films, not only when he's directing them but when he's writing them as well. His use of violence has attracted much criticism, but nobody can deny that it's meticulously stylised and choreographed.And that trademark stylised violence isn't absent from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, it is just reserved for the climax. As light-hearted as it might be at times, it has a dark thread woven through it, as it builds towards the Manson Family's infamous murder of - amongst others - Sharon Tate. Whilst Dalton works to revive his career, Cliff Booth encounters the Family, eventually finding his way the ranch they used as their home, a sequence that is memorably tense, in a slow-burning, tension-ramping sort of way. The ending is pre-destined - except that it isn't. As in Inglourious Basterds, Tarantino (in this case unexpectedly) takes an alternate history approach and turns the denouement into a sort of Hollywood revenge fantasy. Thus, the members of the Manson Family who in real life murdered Sharon Tate instead target Dalton and end up being despatched by Cliff Booth (and Dalton himself in one case) in a completely over-the-top and spectacularly violent fashion. It's really quite tasteless and yet oddly satisfying at the same time.It is likely that neither the ramshackle storyline nor the gory ending will be to everybody's taste, but even if the plot doesn't appeal, the sheer artistry of Tarantino's directing might. He worked closely with Robert Richardson to make Los Angeles look as authentically like it did in 1969 as possible with minimal use of digital effects and it looks impressively authentic (at least to my untrained eye). So too does the fake media, including the black-and-white Bounty Law sequences and the clips from films within a film, including the amusingly over-the-top World War II film in which Booth's character incinerates a room filled with Nazi officers. Not for the first time, Tarantino uses occasional on-screen titles as a narrative tool, as well as narration (in this case from Kurt Russell), although for once we get an almost linear narrative. Still, his customary fondness for close-ups is very much in evidence and having used an original score for his previous film, Tarantino reverts to type for this one, assembling a soundtrack made up of various songs from the era, some of them quite obscure and all of them adding to the illusion of authenticity in the meticulous mise-en-sc\u00c3\u00a9ne that includes some rather wonderful fake movie posters.The large cast lead by Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt is studded with cameos and small parts from various stars, including Al Pacino, and previous Tarantino collaborators Russell, Bruce Dern and Michael Madsen. DiCaprio is great as washed up actor Rick Dalton, as is Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth; between them, they manage to make the friendship between their characters feel entirely real. Di Caprio is also particularly good when Dalton has a breakdown after forgetting his lines on the set on Lancer and then channelling his anger into a stunning performance.Superficially, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood thus has all the ingredients of a \"typical\" Tarantino film, but it sees him mixing them in different proportions. It may not win him any new fans, but to existing ones it should be a reminder of his versatility and his sheer talent and it hints at a growing willingness to stretch his oeuvre in new and interesting ways.", "My take": "That Quentin had a bet \" I could write the worst film ever and people will still call it a masterpiece \" and he's be correct. This was awful. All the scenes filming, the narration. just everything, The manson family scenes could have been good. I loved Pulp, Ingorious, Django, jackie brown( leaving things out because I wrote a whole review and it said it would e rejected for profanity ok) So I refuse to gve this anymore of my time. He needs to come out with another film so us intelligent filmies don't remember him for this trite! Edit to add.. Good films aren't available so soon on bootleg sites and such. My friend said he watched it 2 days ago on some free app.", "Thank you Quentin": "I would like to thank Tarantino for changing the real ending ,some will hate it and think it's bad ,this isn't what really happened,but just watching those hippies get what they deserve and the Polanskies are fine even if it's never happened gives me pleasure.", "Fantastic!": "This movie was so great. Brad Pitt was so funny. DiCaprio was excellent. Margot Robbie was fun. And I almost didn't recognize Dakota Fanning! It really brought out the feel of The Sixties. It has the look and feel of a QT movie. It seems that those who give lower star ratings don't understand the real story. If it didn't make sense to you, or you thought there was no plot, go Google Sharon Tate and the Mason Murders. This is similar to Inglorious Basterds.", "Amazing Movie ! Not for Everyone tho !": "You can consider this movie as a new genre of movies, but i have to say ... if you're looking for a john wick in this movie you will be dissapointed ! A good movie does not necessarily have to be an action movie ! This one can teach you how to enjoy and appreciate a good cinematic work.", "Don't get it!": "I really wanted this to be a movie I could enjoy and like, but it just doesn't hit me. As far as the plot you could have documented anyones activities during the Manson murders.", "Well crafted film, but the proof of the pudding proves pointless": "Tarantino has never done a better job of directing; Brad Pitt has never attained this quality of acting; di Caprio is very good portraying a loser who bears proof of the saying that \"it is not what you know, it is who you know\"; beautiful Margot Robbie is excellent conveying Tate as a bubblehead who loves to watch herself in forgettable parts in incipient flicks; Maggie Qualley is so incredibly sexy even with hair in her armpits; and, albeit brief, it has been some time since I have seen Pacino and Dern in such strong performances. Pacino, in particular, is always better when he does not raise his voice.The script is a bit meandering, but interesting nonetheless, and cinematography is first rate. Another plus is that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood carries less gore than most Tarantino efforts.Yet, despite all these positives, I came away feeling cheated. This was about a serious incident, which saw Sharon Tate Polanski, Folger, Sebring, Woyzeck, and Parent murdered in horrendous and evil circumstances by the Charles Manson gang, and while not ever expecting a documentary from a director as wayward as Tarantino, he uses enough real people like Tate, Polanski, Steve McQueen, Sergio Corbucci, Bruce Lee, George Spahn, for me to reasonably expect some contact with the tragic events of 9 August 2019.Was the whole film a joke? Certainly, Bruce Lee's family are not best pleased with the way he was portrayed in the movie.", "Still disappointing": "Great filmmaking, but Tarantino seems no longer capable of writing an inspiring script. Caught in (self-)references, he indulges in redundant figures and not all too funny dialogues. He seemingly lost his sense of how to convey a story.", "brilliant ending": "This Movie blew my mind; i didnt knew how Hollywood was in the Sixties but man it was awesome. the details in this movie were very impressive.

I like and I'm very familiar with his style of movie but this movie is nothing like his previous gems.This movie is 2 hrs and 45 min long of which about 15 minutes is classic Tarantino. The rest of the 2.5 hrs you're going to be sitting there wondering what kind of trash is this? Unless you're a complete moron who buys anything hook, line and sinker.Brad Pitt did a complete mail in job. He's a toned down version of Aldo The Apache. Seriously, same charisma, same delivery, same mannerisms.Margot Robbie earned the easiest payday she'll ever get. She practically had no lines and was in a big percentage of scenes. Her job was just to look hot and not even have to take her cloths off. Check and check!Leo Dicaprio was the only actor who you can say earned his paycheck but it wasn't much of a stretch for him either. How hard is it to fake a Western accent, probably the easiest to do, yet his was pretty bad considering the caliber of actor.Look, I'm not going to get into the specifics as to why this movie is so bad. This has to be by far the worst Tarantino movie of them all. You will not get the Tarantino violence you're used to. You will not get the wit and humor you're used to.

Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former TV western star and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is his stunt double. Dalton's career is on a downward slide and Booth is also his driver. Dalton discovers that he is living next to famed director Roman Polanski and his actress wife Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Booth is taken with Pussycat (Margaret Qualley) who happens to be a Manson girl.There is only one section of true tension. It's Cliff Booth going to see George at the ranch. The ranch is the best section of the movie. Dalton and Booth have a fascinating chemistry. Brad Pitt may indeed be too pretty to be a stuntman. All of this leads me to conclude that it would be interesting to have Booth go back to the ranch to save George from the hippies. He can shoot them all and have a smoke. Quite frankly, the reworking of the climatic incident lacks the power of the Hitler cinema. I also don't like this Bruce Lee. It reminds me of all the copycat Bruce after his death and I doubt he would do a flying kick to start the fight. Obviously, Tarantino is reworking the legendary Bruce Lee incident but it feels wrong. Tex also feels wrong. There is a reason to rework Hitler for a revenge porn. There is no reason to rework Bruce Lee and if he's reworking the Manson family, he may as well rework it to its full extent. Quite frankly, Mindhunter gives an alternate version of Manson which is infinitely more compelling than this. Tarantino has more than enough skills but he would have more freedom to do a lesser known crime.", "First review here had to": "Amazing film. Was blown away.

A great display of acting skill over Brad Pitt, who simply did not play the written role but simply was it, anyway, the rest of the actors showed a good piece of work and empathy in the roles.

HOWEVER, it did take time to pick up and that's why I would give it an 8/10. I feel if you compare it with pulp fiction, the later definitely kept the audience interested through and through. However for this one it was a bit boring at times in the first half. Leonardo acted amazing, but all his scenes filming the western movies were a bit dull and should've been shortened (would've give it a 10/10). However I feel maybe some people enjoyed it but was not for me. I truly loved Brad Pitt in every scene! He was so handsome and acted phenomenal. Would also like to give credit to his cute pooch Brandy! So adorable and true screen stealer. Margot was angelic and played Sharon so well! She was almost like Sharon's spirit in the film. Towards the end of the movie, wow your in for the rollercoaster that is a Tarentino movie! I've never laughed harder and seen anything so bazzare yet normal! Let's just say, I wish that was the real life ending of what happened. Anyways...GO WATCH THE FILM!

And still doesn't.": "Woefully self-indulgent film-making from the over-praised, under-talented Mr Tarantino that takes several hours to reach a blood-soaked climax as pointless as it is gratuitous.A self-styled comedy thriller that manages neither; this sub-90 minute vanity exercise is ballooned to 3 hours by the hot air of a seemingly unending parade of directorial conceits, foremost of which is the patently ludicrous notion that Hollywood's 'golden days' came to an end in 1969 -- hence the need for a movie such as this to commemorate its passing.Frustratingly for Mr Tarantino though, he wasn't around to witness Hollywood's \"golden days\" and on the basis of 'Once Upon A Time', hasn't a clue what they were or when they were. (Nor, for that matter, have so many Tarantino apologists on this review thread, but at least they haven't made a movie about it.)Too young ever to have been invited to a party at the Fairbanks, or a swim in Jack Warner's pool, Tarantino as latecomer can only peep out at an industry borne on the shoulders of past giants and incoherently chronicle, instead, the life and times of an assortment of more recent dwarfs.If the movie is about the end of anything, it's the end of the existence of any critical faculties in major name film critics, all of whom are bowed in grovelling obeisance to a new-clothes emperor with nothing at all to wear and even less to say.Some slight consolation is however to be found for those who know Hollywood, and know film-making, in the realization that 'Once Upon A Time' is the 9th movie the Great Tarantino has chosen to make . . . and that as he has promised himself, and the world, not to make more than 10, there's only one more cinematic embarrassment of his to avoid in future.", "It just didn't go anywhere!": "What is it with Oscar winning films, I just find them arty and pointless these days.

It just didn't seem to go anywhere.It didn't really have a storyline, just hinted at one. And dragged on quite a while at 2hrs 40 minutes.

While Dern was great that whole thing could have been trimmed down to 5 min easily.The movie should have been reduced to 90 minutes. Even then it would have sucked because there is no tie in with the characters really. Sure the acting was good, but so what? I'd rather see a story line.

Again, do not wait for something big or things happening in general. lol This will turn off a lot of people. Leo, as Rick Dalton, is doing amazing really putting us in the shoes of a Hollywood actor who is struggling with his career. I do not recommend seeing this in theaters though if you are not already into slow burns or/and into Tarantino's movies in general, the trailer was a little misleading here. I didn't love it, but I liked it a lot. I had my laughs and I was enjoying following what Leo and Brad's charcaters are going through.

Not every song is extraordinary, but most of them are in good harmony with what's on the screen and some songs in his movies, this one included, are really great (I really enjoyed the music from Kill Bill, for example).\nSometimes, violence in his movies upsets you. In Django Unchained, some scenes are really upsetting. But in a lot of times, you feel that the violence is somehow justified, and sometimes it's actually funny (in this movie when Bruce Lee loses a fight or the scene with the flamethrower).\nHe focuses on the details a lot. Everything seems in its place. You feel you aren't watching a movie which could have been done on fast forward, but, instead, it makes you wonder how everything fits well in its place.\nGenerally, the dialogues are very simple, if there's a mistake people put a lot of emphasis on correcting it (like a misspelled word). Sometimes, the dialogues feel a bit unnatural, but, all-in-all, they are entertaining and easy to follow. As a side note, in the current movie, a little girl speaks way above her age and uses complicated words. It's a bit ironic, and I think it's intentional.\nThe suspense was quite nicely built. Not exaggerated, but nice. I liked that.\nThere were some clich\u00c3\u00a9s, but, nevertheless the movie was very entertaining.About this movie:\nToo much build-up for the final scene, and other than that pretty much the only action was with one or two fights (with Bruce Lee and in the camp).\nThe movie doesn't explain anything about Manson Family. If you don't live in the US, there's a chance you know nothing about this, and you will not understand why the people in the camp act as fanatics. You just take them as they are, but don't understand the background.\nI liked a lot that the fanatics' lines were biased. It's like the news. If you read some news sources with a clear political orientation, you will see the news is biased, some things are omitted, they try to influence you in one way or another. One bad guy in the movie plans to kill a group of people, but he asks: \"Do you think I'm a liar?\" (approximate quote). So, it's fine if they kill people, but being called a liar is wrong.\nI enjoyed the flamethrower scenes. Also the biting scenes with the dog.\nThe scene where the dog attacks just at the right moment waiting for a sign from Brad Pitt is a bit stretched. We see in the movie that the dog is trained very well, and there is a good communication between the dog and her master, but that point is a bit exaggerated. Very entertaining, though.\nI read later in some reviews of the movie that the neighbor interpreted by Margot Robbie was actually killed by the Mansons in real life. But in the movie, if you didn't know about that, it seemed like there was no connection between the neighbors. They presented a lot of things about the neighbors without a clear connection to the main plot.\nI also found the Italy and Al Pacino story of going to Italy irrelevant. They wrote \"after 6 months\", they could have written \"after 12 months, 6 of them in Italy where the main character gets married\" and you wouldn't miss pretty much anything.\nI've seen some connections with the following movies: The Wolf of Wall Street, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained. I'm sure there were many others.\nI haven't noticed Tarantino playing in his own movie. As far as I know, he shows up sometimes in the movies, but I didn't see him here.\nSeeing Bruce Lee on the screen was so nice! It made me wonder why other directors don't do this more often.", "Overhyped": "+ : great acting, great cinematography\n: slow, predictable, boring", "Quentin did it again": "I was blowned away when first watched in Cannes Festival, its a trully masterpiece.\nVery well done Tarantino, just loved it.\nYou must watch it in theaters when released, you wont regret it", "Tarantino, you've done it again!": "The whole movie, like any Tarantino movie, you sit there in awe wondering where it's all going and how it all ties together, then you get to the last 15 minutes and wow, all hell breaks loose in the absolute best way possible.

I have enjoyed Quentin Tarantino movies in the past with such fare as the masterpiece \"Kill Bill\" and other fare like \"Deathproof\", but they had some great story lines. Here the actors and actresses were good with what they were given, which in my opinion wasn't even a bone (even the dog had canned food in the movie and not a bone) lol.

This is just another Inglorious Basterds. Start well, one expects something would happen, it doesn't and the end (for me) ruins everything. The problem with this movie is not in acting or technical aspects. There Mr. Tarantino learned some lessons being \"self-educated\" as a compiler of many referential stuff seen before in classic movies. The problem is the ending. Especially when everybody knows what really had happened. Some real life character interpretations (Bruce Lee?) are even funny and maybe true, but then everything gets lost in Mr. Tarantino's fairy land. So far, the only coherent film he's done is Reservoir Dogs. Everything else is a hard-to-bear mashup of everything and nothing (especially Kill Bill), pure trash (Death Proof) or abruptly interrupted story, in which he is pretty consistent. Mr. Tarantino has potentials and talent (and Ed Wood type of enthusiasm) and original approach to matter, but definitely lacks formal education and a sense of measure. Some call it \"art\". Well, it isn't. His friend Robert Rodriguez could help him a lot (and did so far). Omitting him here again is another mistake. 4 stars for actors and scenery recreation.

Plus the dialogue was borderline meaningless and unentertaining. The Sharon Tate thing was kinda cool, though. And Margot Robbie!!

It's cinematography and music score are enough to make anyone with enough knowledge of the late 60s and the golden age of Hollywood, leap with joy. I can remember seeing this in theaters on the day it came out and since it was new no one really new what to expect going into the movie. No one even really knew what the movie was about. And that's a good thing. Movies where you can guess what happens at the end are not good movies, and this is not one of those movies. I don't know what I was expecting when I saw this, but I pleasantly surprised to find this my Quentin Tarantino movie. I'll always love django unchained, but that movie can't be compared to this one at all. Once upon a time isn't even a film, really. it's Quentin creating his own fairytale universe with his special Tarantino touch of unnecessary but oddly entertaining dialogue, sudden beautiful and bloody violence that startles you to your core, and those detailed and distinct characters that feel real enough to walk right off the silver screen. In short this is the best Quentin Tarantino film I've ever seen, But I know for sure some of you will not like this film no matter how much you like Quentins work. This movie is not for everyone. If you've never seen a old movie (and by old I mean older then the 1980s and 1970s) then this movie will probably not interest you. If your not a fan of long dialogues and scenes of characters narrating over themselves, again this is not the movie for you. If you don't know who Charlie mason Is or have never heard of the mason family murders. Then look those up before watching this movie I recommend doing that or the ending will seem pointless. But if your a fan of any of the stuff I mentioned above or, nostalgia and golden age Hollywood stuff, this may end up being one of your favorite movies. And Leonardo DiCaprio, and brad Pitt are in this, that equals a good time for everyone watching. I also believe Leo would have won best actor for this movie, if Joaquin Phoenix's joker wasn't released the same year as this.", "Emmmm": "Boring, nothing happened. Like Nothing at all! The only decent character was the dog!", "Beautiful but boring": "The acting was good, the visualisation of this era amazing, but it was all so slow, almost very boring.\nAfter half an hour cellphone screens started to pop up, realising I was not the only person getting bored. And yes, the end was full of action.

I never write reviews, but I just have to share before you waste hours of your life.\nIt's not a comedy. It's not a drama. It's nothing like Tarantino before. Just boring old reminiscing about their successful olden years. Nothing funny, nothing serious, nothing exciting. WTF.", "Definitely good for a laugh or two or...": "A movie with a lot of humour, sarcasm, and great interplay between DiCaprio and Pitt. As much as I love movies, I also love the shots Tarantino takes at the Hollywood/celebrity scene. This movie is a three-hour running joke and Hollywood is the target!", "WTF": "I dont know if it was the best movie ive seen or the worst one... All I said when it ended was WTF!", "A character driven, heady film": "When you sit down to watch a new QT film for the first time you know he's always going to deliver on certain things. You know his track record, and you've been a fan for a long time. Some of his films are more story oriented, like Django, Basterds. They're both pretty much revenge flicks. Then you get a film like Pulp Fiction which is more character oriented. When you think about Pulp Fiction the story pretty much revolves around a few days in the life and relationship of Vincent and Jules. That's it. The Kill Bills were both story and character driven. Once Upon A Time... is one of QT's character oriented films, so if you go into it expecting and waiting for a plot like Basterds or Django you will probably be a little disappointed. I've read some critics say this film shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Pulp Fiction. I would say it's the first of QT's films since Pulp Fiction that is a real buddy flick since this one revolves around pals Rick (Leo) and Cliff (Pitt). Once Upon A Time... will likely resonate more with QT's older audience because at it's core it is about the changing of the guard. The young pushing out the old, and the people getting pushed out struggling to understand their place in a changing industry and world. The film takes place at a time when Hollywood is changing, and both Rick and Cliff are well aware their best days are behind them. They can see the changes in themselves, in the TV and film industry, and in the city and people around them. They're having a tough time wrapping their heads around it, and especially in Rick's case he doesn't know how much time he has left in his career. These are feelings that will resonate with QT's older fans. If you go into it expecting a sentimental, and heady film, then it delivers on that.", "Not great (last half) but not bad (first half) either": "Given my title, it's surprising that I gave this a 6/10 or 3/5, which for me means below average but not bad either. A lot of reviews are either 8-9/10 or really low which emphasise the love it or hate it nature, I've tried to be fair.I was really excited to watch this after hearing of the initial response it got and high rating of 9.5+/10. I made the mistake of forgetting that just because critics love a movie, regular folk may not.I want to start by saying I have no criticism to the acting of this film. Di Caprio brilliantly plays an actor who I can only describe as knowing his best days are over and the drink he needs to cope with this. Pitt is his stunt double and chauffeur who comes to his own in the latter half. Margot, well she really doesn't do much, again that's not her fault.The problem with OUATIH is mainly the plot and slow pace. All of this would have been forgiven had the main scene the film builds up to been more accurate. Instead you get the feeling of being underwhelmed by it despite this being a fictionalised version of events.To my final point, the critics seem to love Tarantino and this kind of movie, I just feel the average movie goer will not. If this was on TV, I would have changed the channel after around half an hour. Which then makes me think that QT has employed Di Caprio and Pitt to draw people in to watch the film. I went into this as a fan of Leo who if someone else was cast in his place, I probably would not have been interested. Having said that, if Christopher Nolan was directing, it could have had a load of nobodies in and I would still watch it.If you got this far, I'm a huge Leonardo Di Caprio fan and his acting was really good. Not brilliant or award winning mind you. Despite that, I feel like I'm doing an injustice by giving this 6/10. I can't think of another movie of his that I've watched and thought of as this low.", "WHAT AN Ending!!": "It was a special movie in acting, the fight between Bruce Lee and Brad was incredible, lots of camera footage (tarintino),and of course the ending, what I didn't like in this movie that it was tall than it has to be.", "Pretty good": "It is a long Movie, but still fun and has some good acting", "Once upon a time....Hollywood made good movies": "Well, not anymore! This movie proves that no matter how many great actors are put in a movie, they just can't make a movie worth watching anymore. I literally felt my IQ drop while I pushed through this show.

It takes a psychopath to make a movie like and I'm glad Tarantino is our directing psychopath.I've seen a lot of movies over the years, I've rewatched the greatest and I've seen the amazing movies hidden in the shadows, there are only a handful that game me the same feeling this movie did.This movie is one that makes you want to become a film director yourself.Thank you Quentin Tarantino!", "Hate the way they abuse bruce lee in a fight scene": "Hate the way they abuse bruce lee in a fight scene. I don't know what he's trying prove.", "Perfect movie for Quentin Tarantino fans": "First of all, I will say that the story is an interesting one but Quentin Tarantino told it in a confusing way. What I mean by that is that the movie was all over the place until it finally got its grounding in the middle. Until the middle, the movie would cut away to tell a different story at random points instead of just finishing that one person's story and then transitioning to the next. Because of this the film to me just felt a bit choppy and all over the place. This movie is two-hours and forty-one-minutes long and I feel like it could have been cut down. Some scenes just felt like they dragged on for far too long and there were so many perfect spots for the movie to end but it just kept dragging on and the ending we got comes out of nowhere and doesn't fit the rest of the film so it should have just been removed. The acting in this film though was great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt easily came off as friends and this seems like such a minor thing but really, it's a major thing. Sometimes actors can't act like friends who have known each other but they came across as people who have worked together for years. Now, I'm not the biggest Leonardo Dicaprio fan but this film made me slowly start to appreciate his acting a bit more. For me, he was the stand out in this film because he could easily do both serious and funny scenes. Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie, who play Sharon Tate, also did great jobs. The soundtrack to this film was filled with great songs from that decade. In the end, this film is defiantly for people who are Quentin Tarantino fans or just want to relive the glory days of older Hollywood.", "Brilliant": "Reading certain reviews just shows the lack of education in this country.

No in between for Tarantino's latest. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood works for it is a buddy movie mixed in with Hollywood tales and experiences. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood submerges the viewer into 1969 Hollywood, full of elitists, cults, clicks and the Hollywood crowd. The viewers learns about Rick Dalton's acting woes, syndication problems, and personal acting problems. A producers guides Dalton and we see the change in movie Westerns from 50's to Italian westerns to the more gritter Westerns of the late 60's. Dalton craps on in is a needy character for the Cliff Booth character. (aka Dalton's personal stunt double) What we learn from the relationship from the stuntman's perspective that Booth finds the crap in Hollywood is par for him. First the viewer feels bad about the relationship until we find out that Dalton goes to bat for the black listed stuntman. Cliff faults balance out Dalton's fault as the film unfolds. Cliff is a Alpha male tough guy with no fear Navy Seal personality, who gets into many a tall tale. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood gives threw the movie experience a feel for Hollywood and what goes on in the industry, back in the day. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood gives the middle finger to P C Hollywood with it's 60's counterculture vibe with a surprise ending of what if the Manson family and it's countercultureism home invaded the wrong place.

This fresh piece of film is the surprise of the summer.", "Once Upon a Time Tarantino Could Make a Movie": "This isn't a bad movie because it isn't a movie at all.

I endured it for 2 hours and then left. I guess it eventually ends, buti by the time I left I really didn't care. And I was by no means the first to leave the show. Smarter people started leaving after about 30 minutes. I stayed. I thought \"Tarantino:\" - wrong! I thought - \"Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio\" - wrong!

There was no point in her character in the film considering she had no important scenes... actually I could argue she was the least important character in a film.The film had no substance whatsoever, it was incredibly dull and safe to say I did not enjoy the film at all, if this was not directed by Tarantino then this film would be slated.", "The most Tarantino a movie can be": "This film might subvert people's expectations by not really being about the murder on Sharon Tate. It's about a struggling actor and his stunt double and their lives in Hollywood of 1969. The audience follows actor Rick Dalton through his career while presenting his fear of being more and more forgotten. All in all not much plot is happening in a movie that is as long as Django Unchained. And dammed, is it amazing.\nThe acting, cinematography, dialogue and characters are all as beautiful and outstanding as Tarantino is famous for. I didn't see the story going anywhere and I didn't need to. Every single scene is intriguing and entertaining. I enjoyed it so much that I was actually sad when it was over. A three hour movie felt too short because I wanted more and more. It's like a visit into Quentin Tarantino's office, better yet his mind. A pleasure from beginning to end that I definitely recommend.", "A tribute to the Golden age of Hollywood!": "The seesawing story of Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood rests on a fulcrum of understood history. We're meant to recognize the Hollywood of 1969 and the fate of Sharon Tate; we're also drawn to leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, their shared movie-star allure having accrued across decades. Those are the twin hooks of the film, and Tarantino reels us in by using both to generate suspense-such as that's possible-and meaning. If nothing else, he delights in this interaction between real and fake-and back again.Leonard Dicaprio and Brad Pitt give career high performances. Dicaprio is Rick Dalton, a TV cowboy actor who longs for movie stardom but has now hit the skids. Pitt plays Cliff Booth his stunt double/driver and all around best bud. They also represent doubles of each other in real life, though Dalton is angry and frustrated at his failings in life while Booth is perfectly happy to be his pal's gopher and handyman. There is good recreations of TV westerns of the time, Dalton had been the star of \"Bounty Law\" a show that never existed but is clearly based on Steve McQueen's \"Wanted Dead Or Alive\" series. Dalton is now playing guest role villains on TV. An actual series \"Lancer\" is recreated here, I never saw this show when it aired since it was on up against \"The Mod Squad\" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dalton has some funny and touching scenes opposite a precocious 8 year old actress while doing the \"Lancer\" episode. The late Luke Perry has his final film appearance in these scenes also.Margot Robbie has an almost magical presence playing actress Sharon Tate. Tate unfortunately is best known today as the most famous of the Manson family murder victims. We see not only how beautiful she was but also how good and kind she was as well. One of my favorite scenes is when she goes to a movie theater to watch \"The Wrecking Crew\" a film she made in 1968 with Dean Martin. We see actual clips of the movie, (with the real Sharon Tate) and cuts back to her reactions, she becomes delighted when the audience laughs at her comedy bits and applauds at her fight scene with Nancy Kwan.This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support.The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair.I liked Brad's character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn't.Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters.The streak of melancholic nostalgia running through Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might have blunted the razor-sharp edge of Quentin Tarantino, but it only emphasises the care he puts into his craft. A brilliant film made by one of the world's biggest film fans...and a must-see for everyone else.", "Tarantino gets most things right": "Such as the recreation of the 60s: cars, d\u00c3\u00a9cor. smoking, TV etc. He is a most stylish and skilful filmmaker and knows how to create and film memorable, impressive scenes. And for most of the film he restrains his love of violence. But then at the end, an unnecessary orgy of violence which it would have been more classy and stylish to suggest or report. Back in the C5th bc., Greek tragedians knew that simply reporting mayhem was the classy way of doing this. One has to wonder about the psychological health of QT and his obsessive fascination with extreme violence. A special delight of this film is the lovely throbbing sound of Rick Walton's V8 Cadillac, featured in a number of scenes. And near the end, there is a rustbucket V8 with a defective muffler that emits a chugging throb that is pure heaven. (Rick comes out to complain about the noise but ignore him). Well done, QT, for resurrecting this great clunker.", "Short summary": "Blah Blah. More Blah Blah. Even more Blah Blah. Some dumb hippies are killed. The end.This is by far the worst Tarantino movie. A movie without a coherent story and without any tension buildup. Even Death Proof is a masterpiece compared to this.", "Don't cry in front of the Mexicans.": "Rick Dalton is down in the dumps. Even though he's been a successful TV actor for some time now, he's tired of getting typecast in the same kind of role every time, the villain who gets his ass kicked. His stunt double Cliff Booth's career has fallen by the wayside as well, working with Rick but not getting any other work. While they're dealing with their personal problems the Manson cult is starting to gain traction.This is a unique movie, even by Tarantino's standards. It harkens back to the dialogue-focused films in the vein of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, but it's quite different from those as well. While the stories are fun to watch, it's more strictly focused on character, both the people we are following and the 60's setting itself. The signs, classic posters, vintage stores, classic music and movie sets in their charming rough glory really transports you to a different time. It's not just a cute homage, he puts you right on the spot.\nThe main arc is populated by Rick Dalton's dreams of becoming more than just a B-grade actor, feeling insecure with himself and feeling he's lost it. Leonardo Dicaprio brings a level of sincerity and admirable dedication to the role. Dalton is a starving artist. He's clearly got a lot of talent, but never gets a chance to fully utilize it. When he eventually even struggles to remember the simplest of lines, he loses it in what is one of my favorite scenes in the movie. Yelling at himself in the mirror to lay off the alcohol and do the god-damn job an actor's supposed to do is hilarious and very relatable to anyone wanting to be taken seriously as an actor. Sometimes when I'm recording lines and I just keep doing takes of the same line over and over and over again I feel like I'm going insane. Is something wrong with me? When am I going to be good enough? Thankfully in this case, this results in Rick doing the best damn acting job he's done in his whole life. The scene with him as the mustached villain holding a little girl hostage threatening to cut her throat is legitimately intimidating. He finally found the confidence he needed to be truly great.Cliff Booth's story is less structured and mostly consists of him pissing people off and showing everyone who's in charge. But that doesn't mean it's not a helluva lot of fun to watch. Bruce Lee being shown as a cocky little kid whose mouth is bigger than his fighting skills is pure gold. Mike Moh did a great job playing him. Cliff throwing Lee so hard he creates a buckle in Janet's car got a big laugh out of me.\nWhen Cliff drives the flirty hippie girl Pussycat to George Spahn's movie ranch, we get a very tenseful sequence. He doesn't really trust anyone there. People are staring out the windows, the \"farm\" looks more like a barren wasteland and Squeaky is so desperate to stop him from saying hello to George it's like she's holding him hostage. Cliff's meeting with George is short, but amusing. Bruce Dern gives a colorful portrayal of a senile and cranky old man who's been kept isolated from the world for God knows how long. He's happy someone came to visit him, even if his grouchy behavior indicates otherwise, but Cliff still leaves feeling frustrated and disappointed he's forced to live with all these weird-ass creeps. His irritation reaches its peak when a guy who looks like he hasn't showered in a year punctures one of his tires. The resulting impulse to come over and beat his face bloody over and over again is a well-placed sudden shock of violence. Since the movie has been pretty restrained up to this point, you don't expect Cliff to get so angry he will beat someone to the point where their face is disfigured. It's funny in a darkly humorous way.The friendship between Rick and Cliff is also a huge factor into what makes the movie so enjoyable, and gives it a touch of heart. Apparently Dicaprio and Pitt became friends in real life during the production, and some of that definitely translates into many of the scenes. When they are watching Rick's part in a television show and commenting while they're doing so, it feels very natural and loose, how you'd really hear two friends converse while they're doing something together. It wouldn't surprise me if this is one of the parts that were improvised.All right, let's talk about Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie's performance as Tate is adorable. Quentin Tarantino adored Sharon Tate, both as an actor and a person. And while I don't know her as much more than \"That girl from Valley Of The Dolls!\", I think he made me fall in love with her a little too. My favorite part is when she goes to a movie she's co-starring in in the theater, and finds it so exciting to watch herself and hear the audience behind her laugh. She can feel the admiration people have for her.\nI also love that her real-life fate was changed to something much more uplifting. Usually this would be a serious breach of historical accuracy, but is that really what you come to a Tarantino movie for? Her murder being prevented and Rick coming over for a friendly visit is the perfect conclusion you can give to her. She get to continue spreading joy and making people smile.My favorite actor Al Pacino gets a few nice moments to shine, creating a very eccentric and funny personality in Marvin Schwarz. \"Who's gonna beat the s'hit out of you next week? Mannix? The Man From U.N.C.L.E.? The *girl* from U.N.C.L.E.? How about Batman & Robin?\" Unfortunately, and this is one of the few problems I have with the film, he's extremely underutilized. He only appears in a 3 minute long scene in the beginning, and at the halfway point or so he appears for a few more seconds. Maybe there's a lot that got cut out, but when I saw him in the trailer I thought he would be a major important character. Instead it's only just *barely* more than a cameo.The pacing can be slow at times too. It never hurts the movie severely, but it feels a little directionless at points. This is only for short stretches though, most of the time I had a blast.The final act does go all-out with the violence and mayhem, and does so with a touch of black humor. Cliff is so stoned that you think he's practically defenseless and an easy target for the Manson cult members, but then he suddenly starts stabbing people left and right and brutally beats Squeaky's face to a bloody pulp, even more so than the as'shole who damaged his left tire. His dog (which I haven't mentioned until now) gets in on the action as well and demolishes Tex's crotch to the point where it probably looks like an anorexic gerbil. Nothing is more satisfying however than when one of them disturbs Rick relaxing in his pool and he responds by bringing out the flamethrower from one of his movies. Rick's just as much of an action hero in real life as he is onscreen.Even my friend who's not a fan of Tarantino found a lot to like in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. It's funny, it's nostalgic without ever feeling self-indulgent, and it's got one of the best acting duos I've seen this decade. I promise it'll be worth your dime.", "Phonomenal Brad and Leonardo": "I truly felt as if i was part of the movie with all their close ups. Top greatest group of actor of all time.", "A waste of time and talent": "Oof. It is a ninth movie from and by Quentin Tarantino, assuming Deathproof counts as a movie, and assuming the two volumes of Kill Bill are one movie combined. Fortunately, there's just one more movie left to endure, as Tarantino regresses away from entertaining fare, grinding out the cinematic equivalents of long-avoided dental work.We are treated to an early Wilhelm Scream, a modest suggestion that we, the audience, are about to be bathed in 161 minutes of fun, winks and nudges, pastiches and homages, and a wistful sentimentality, all of which will make us pine for simpler times when love was free, hippies always kinda sucked, and men's men smoked real cigarettes which must be lit with fire.The first hour or so meanders aimlessly in what seems to be a \"Deer Hunter-esque\" exposition to introduce us to vapid characters and their nostalgic milieu. Cars go places, people have conversations, Margot Robbie's talents go wasted, and shots of shoes and feet remind us that people do walk around at times, and Tarantino literally likes to shove his foot fetish in our faces.What is the purpose of pasting together assorted scenes which are tips of caps to better, more iconic originals? Why do we have to see dirty hippie feet smashed into windshields, as if it means something more than it is? Why is violence against women reproduced comically? What is orange and looks good on hippies?Tarantino caught lightning in a bottle with Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown. Someone let all that energy dissipate out into a wading pool of fecklessness, never to be recaptured again.", "Great Freaking Movie": "I am up and down on QT. but this movie reached out and grabbed me. DeCaprio and Pitt were amazing together. their chemistry was Redford/Newman good. the Spahn Ranch scene was creepy without being over the top. there were SO many great smaller roles, many featuring well known actors that were so hidden in their characters that i was surprised numerous times during the credits. the cigarette smoking was so pervasive i left the theatre with a hacking cough. this is one of those movies that will reveal new gems with each viewing. i grew up during the 60's and this movie nailed my memories and dreams. and the ending.......Oy Vey. i have had a long standing top 10 favorite films. this movie just elbowed it's way in.", "Wow...the definition of overrated!": "Excellent acting by DiCaprio and Pitt is the only feature of this movie for which it gets 6/10. The Oscar nominations, except for these two, are not on merit. many other pictures of the year are much better. And what was Margot Robbie doing in this picture? I mean, her being there or not has no impact. What was the point? And the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay is the biggest blasphemy committed by the Academy. This picture and its Oscars nominations are the proof that perception management can make even the most ordinary things look and seem stellar in people's minds. Also, it proves yet again that movies made about actors in particular and hollywood in general will continue to be Academy's favorite.", "This masterpiece is a fantasy.": "\"Once Upon A Time\" ? When was the last time you heard about this phrase ? To me, when I was little. And everytime I hear it, I know my grandfather is going to tell some very exciting tales before I go to sleep.This is one of the reasons why Tarantino named this films. No Sharon Tate murder scene, he turned the tables around, and wrote the whole historic year of 1969 again by his intelligence and knowledge of what defined Hollywood, and what Hollywood was going on at that time.Leo and Brad's performances is unbelievably outstanding. Leo played an out-dated actor in this movie for Quentin's movie. He's shown everybody how hard and tough its gonna be when you're an actor, its not just the highlights, front page of magazine, money, fame but the other side of it. Brad played a total badass, I'd take Brad for an action movie anyday rather than any actors out there nowadays. Him and his doggo was incredibly memorable in this movie.By the way, why people get mad about Bruce Lee scene ? It is Brad who is day-dreaming about what would've happened if he'd stayed with Rick at the scene. And as stuntman with such personality and talent, strong character, he'd have gone for a fight with any guy. And he day-dreamed that he would won. But in reality, we all know that Brad would not, and in a way, Bruce Lee would never harm him, he just gonna give Brad a lesson.Overall, I love the ending. That's all we wish that should've happened in real life. I hope Sharon and her child in the heaven watch this smiling.\nPerfect \"Once Upon A Time\" in Hollywood.Thank you, Mr. Tarantino.", "Indulgent and exploitative": "This is two distinct films clumsily stitched together.First two hours is about a actor on the way down (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stuntman buddy/gopher (Brad Pitt). Nothing much happens. DiCaprio is particularly poor. The best performance in this section is from an 8-year-old girl which gives an idea of what calibre of production you are watching.The last half hour is an unpleasant reimagining of the Sharon Tate murder in which Tarantino includes his two fictional heroes. It's set six months later and makes extensive use of narration to explain what is happening - always a sign of poor writing.You get the feeling that the \"short\" at the end is the film Tarantino really wanted to make, but he had to add two hours of Hollywood nostalgia at the start to make it seem anything other than exploitation.The cars, clothing and sets are all lovingly created at great expense. But outside of a handful of scenes (Margot Robbie at the movies, Pitt at the old ranch), it's nothing more than a poor movie with a nasty ending.", "5 out of 8 people in my row left before it was over!!": "What do I say, the worst QT movie ever. The movie literally has NO STORY, just showing all these different characters doing, well, nothing interesting. I kept forcing myself to watch, waiting and hoping it'd get better- unfortunately it never did. I really wanted to love this movie, as I've loved every QT movie before, however now after seeing it, I'm struggling finding anything I liked about it at all... Wish I could get my money and time back. And honestly I wonder who the people giving this a high rating are. Whomever I talked to after the movie, felt the same as me and my friends: bored and disappointed.", "Tarantino's tribute to the golden era of Hollywood is a lot of fun in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood": "In the age where digital streaming from Netflix and Amazon are filling entertainment voids, where are movies leading. Many people have argued that major studios are relying too much on established properties be either continued or remade. I can see where their coming from as these are not only likely to make money, but big money. It used to be that an original movie was made, and that over time, people would come back to so often that it would set a long term probability. If Netflix and Amazon has taught us anything is that their shows like Stranger Things and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel can also obtain long term popularity. So why can't movies do something similar?A lot of it has to do that major studios have fallen behind on what it means to be popular. It's good to see that some filmmakers have not succumbed to this mindset. In fact, Quentin Tarantino is very open about rejecting that way a lot of movies and TV shows are made. He's clearly a man who loves the craft and how movies used to made, whether he's doing tributes to martial arts, grindhouse, or exploitation movies. Movies like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood make me more grateful for Tarantino.In 1969 in the fading light of the golden era of Hollywood, western star Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is lambasting that his career is already on the way out, as most of his roles are of Western TV shows like Bounty Law. His best friend and stunt double Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt) hangs with him and even has a second job as his driver. The two talk about the changing state of the industry, along with Dalton's alcoholism that seems to be harming his career.Dalton lives next door to rising film director Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie) who all represent the new blood incoming to the industry. Regardless, Dalton takes what he can get and gets casted as another villain to a pilot western called Lancer. Since he couldn't get stunt double work on that same show, Booth picks up a girl and he gives her a lift to Spahn Ranch owned by the blind and senile George Sphan (played by Bruce Dern), unaware it's also home to the Manson Family.For spoiler reasons, I don't want to give the rest away. Though that would be hard too as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood doesn't really have a story. But that's typical of a Tarantino movie...and this also makes for another fun movie. It's clear that Tarantino holds their period of Hollywood close to his heart. This may be the first movie from him where the environment plays a character itself as the main cast will wonder around where the plot takes them, and yet none of it felt boring. Whether it was Sharon Tate's home, a western studio or the Sphan Ranch, it all has personality that plays a different effect on these characters. An aging star could feel out of place while a Manson family member has more control.Speaking of which, both Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt make a great team thanks to their chemistry and good dialogue. Both actors have worked with Tarantino before, but never together. But both also have the kind of chemistry that's lacking in a lot of new talent in current Hollywood. It's hard to explain, but the best way is that you take your eyes off of either actor as they each have their turn at exploring a part of 1969 Los Angeles.Whether or not this is Tarantino's best movie is debatable. It's not heavy on action (go watch Kill Bill or Inglorious Bastards for that), but it's dialogue and scenes are fun to watch and listen to. This is why Once Upon a Time in Hollywood belongs in the same category as Pulp Fiction; where it's more about where these characters are going and what their doing. They aren't as flashed out and original as Pulp Fiction, but I was still happy with these Hollywood-types taking stage. It's like seeing an old-fashioned gossip magazine from my parents closet come to life.I'll give this nine western TV show advertisements out of ten. Be sure to get comfy as the movie is well over two and a half hours. As I said, it's never boring, and offers an environment that's so rich in detail, that'll it warrant rewatches just off of that. The fact it's also a fun movie is the cherry on the top. Go see it and have an old fashioned ball.", "No Plot, No problem! Roll the window down and enjoy the breeze of the 60's.": "An amazing cinematic experience! I think I went the entire film with a smile on my face.Every little detail about the athmosphere the movie was trying to create was so spot on I could almost touch it.I was taken through a 2:30h ride through the 60's and it was nothing short of breathtaking. The backgrounds, the soundtracks, the cars, the incredible acting - cannot fault it. Thanks Tarantino.", "Once Upon a Time... another Tarantino's GOOD movie": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, is a manifest of Tarantino's love for the Seventh Art in the best way possible, with all the cameos and references of cinema. The plot focuses on a masculine and bulletproof relationship during the 60s, that consist on a misdirected stunt double (Brad Pitt) and an outdated actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), parallel to the female protagonist (or onlooker) Sharon Tate, portrayed by Margot Robbie with an immaculate and human touch.\nTarantino criticizes the hippies community and their \"flower power\", he also lifted a middle finger for all the anti-smoking people, and ignored the car pollution, being one of the themes: \"the feeling of driving a car, while smoking a Red Apple and harassing every woman on the sidewalk.\"\nWith a fast resolution, counterproductive and hard to finish, a fantastic soundtrack with a powerful production design, Tarantino open us a visual window for all this 60s generation, being \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" not a movie about a story lived in LA at the 60s, but a movie about LA in the 60s.", "An interesting film but certainly nothing special": "Forget the hype due to the creator's name and judge for yourselves.", "Fail": "Sorry it didn't pass anything I could think ofNot a good movie..good acting but this doesn't make a good movie", "Classic Tarantino w/ Great Acting": "Beautifully shot, superb acting. A little slow at times. This film could have been shorter. The ending is a doozy...", "Go see it... Twice.": "QT delivers big league. Forget the disappointing Hateful Eight. His classic vignette-style moviemaking is in full effect though presented differently than most of his previous work. The dialogue we love is there but is not so conscious of itself as usual. QT serves up some subversively sexy shots of Pitt and Robbie, just a little cherry on top for his audience.Thanks QT for gifting us a movie starring Pitt and DiCaprio. Reality and fiction blur in more ways than one. The QT universe hums quietly in the background ready to dish out more Easter eggs at every turn.One critic said this movie is like a time machine. I agree. It's an immersive experience. The characters have heart. I learned to love Rick Dalton as his story unfolds. Pitt's stuntman Cliff Booth is the real star, his story is where real life is taking place.Every performance is beyond satisfactory. The soundtrack is a dream. The color saturation and cinematography is all you'd expect from QT and then some. I wanted to see this film again immediately and plan to today.", "Thoughts about Tarantino's 9th movie": "When you see lead cast members and the director, you can easily increase your expectations. If we look at the movie objectively without Di Caprio and Pitt's performances it would be very dull to watch this movie. Basically they saved the movie. They have very good chemistery in this movie and I hope they can work with each other in another project. The other performances was't remarkable but they are good like Margot robbie's Sharon tate.\nI think all cinema lovers should watch the movie but casual action movie fans can find this movie boring.\nFinally, This movie is not Tarantino's best work but it's not weakest too. If you don't have huge expectations or expect this movie to become masterpiece you can dissapoint. With strong perfomances of lead actors it is quite watchable but it could be cut 10-15 minutes it would be better because some scenes feel you it is too long. However it is a long movie it should be seen.", "Love the political incorrectness! It's so refreshing in today's suffocating political correctness.": "Another Quentin Tarantino masterpiece. What if we could go back in time and change the horrible fate that awaited Sharon Tate and her friends on that summer night of 1969. It was great to see those \"dirty hippies\" walk into the home of a failing actor with a fire blasting gun and a body double with a pet pit bull.", "Sony gave Quentin too much leash": "Harvey's version would have pared down an hour. Instead, we get Q indulging every boyhood memory, forgetting that we've seen a lot of it already in the last 8 films. Feet, feet, and more feet; 20 year-old Hollywood icons played by uber famous, 50 year-old Q buddies. I felt like it was one long Revenge of the Nerds Jock Talent Show scene. \"We're awesome! Submit!\" This movie forgets the golden rule of film: entertain the audience. Instead, Q entertains himself, thinking his audience will obey. Not me. The storyline was boring, slow, wanting plot, and missing opportunities.", "Forget the notion there are 28 plots in Hollywood films": "This one is different, in a good way. DO NOT tell folks about the ending - it's one of those. But the notion that there are just 28 plots in all H'wood flicks, and that all the others are based on those, is just not true. Bravo to Quinton for breaking that 4th wall. A movie within a movie, then altering the course of world events. All with excellent acting by all principals AND smaller part folks? Awesome. One of the best films of recent history. Now I have to go watch Pulp Fiction again, as I was one of a very few who didn't appreciate it.", "Not Tarantino's best.": "I can't say I'm disappointed because this movie is better then most movies.\nBut as a Tarantino-movie I'm a bit almost disappointed.There's really no plot, nothing that keeps the movie moving forward but thanks to Pitt & DiCaprio (well pretty much all the cast) Tarantino is able to pull this off.", "Silly people don't like this movie!!! (love for the silly, though)": "If you are an impatient person who doesn't understand what makes up great character development, top notch storytelling, excellent acting, wonderful cinematography, etc., then you will hate this movie. If you like movies such as Cool Hand Luke, Taxi Driver, Shawshank Redemption, Amores Perros, Whiplash, Godfather and the like, you will love this flick. QT nailed it! DiCaprio was astounding. Pitt the best!!! Almost as good as he was in Fight Club.Ignore the goofballs who say this is bad - unless you are a goofball yourself and like Transformers or LaLa Land...", "I just lost almost 3 hours": "Worst movie, going no where, just letting time flow, without no story.", "I thought that it's about story, that most people know": "I thought that it's about story, that most people know. But this movie not about people, or exact story. This movies about the time. I think Tarantino made this movies for himself and several people who get it. If you don't know this year and stories, that was in real life, most likely you don't get it and it will be pretty boring. I recommend you to read about that time and watch this movie once again. There is a lot of irony in the Movie about everything, including viewers and Tarantino fans. Please watch this movie until the end. Don't drop it.

This movie had a great amount of action and a brilliant plot line. I dont want to give away any spoilers but i will say it did a great job on the Manson family.", "Glorious to look at, Tarantino's love letter to 60's Hollywood.": "Of all Tarantino's controversial films, OUATIA seems to have polarised critics and movie-goers more than most. What did I make of it? To be honest I'm still processing.The plot revolves around three characters over a couple of days in February and August 1969. Rick Dalton (Leonardo diCaprio) is an ageing film star, on the long wind down from stardom. As producer Marvin Schwartz (Al Pacino) points out to him, there's a reason he's being offered the 'heavy' roles in lots of TV pilots. The studios no longer care about him, and his job is just to make their young new stars look good. This is having a devastating affect on Rick's confidence and self-belief.Propping him up, both literally and psychologically is Rick's long-term stuntman buddy Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Cliff keeps repeatedly running into a hippy chick (a brilliantly vibrant Margaret Qualley) on the streets of LA.Living next door to Dalton (and the almost ever-present Booth) at 10050 Cielo Drive are newly weds the Polanski's. That's Roman (Rafal Zawierucha, clearly auditioning to be the new Austin Powers!) and fledgling actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Those with only a subliminal knowledge of true-crime will know what happened there in true life on August 8th 1969. A heavily pregnant Tate and three of her friends (together with a hapless by-stander) were brutally murdered by members of the 'hippie' cult under the control of Charles Manson. (An interesting historical fact is that both Quincy Jones and Steve McQueen were both also invited to be present on that evening).As this is a Quentin Tarantino film, albeit a revisionist one, you know the night is not going to end with a cookie and a nice cup of hot chocolate!Man.... Leonardo diCaprio and Brad Pitt are good! If you were to think of male film actors of the past with natural screen charisma, who would you pick? Errol Flynn? Cary Grant, for sure. Steve McQueen. Possibly Harrison Ford? Pitt and diCaprio just ooze confidence and charisma in this movie, and are clearly having enormous fun.This is particularly true of diCaprio who's always had the \"it\" factor in spades. (Remember that phenomenal champagne toast in \"The Great Gatsby\"?) Here he is supremely confident in playing an ever-so-slightly-stuttering character who's confidence is on the wane. A scene where precocious young actress Trudi (a splendid performance from Julia Butters) whispers to him \"That's the best acting I've ever seen\" is an Oscar-worthy piece of acting in its own right.Pitt is also still a pin-up at 56... as a guy who clearly has a whole wing of his home dedicated to gym equipment, a rooftop scene is certainly \"one for the ladies\".Much has been made of Margot Robbie's lack of lines in the film. But she honestly does most of her acting here - which is flawless - without needing lines. A scene of her watching herself (actually the real life Sharon Tate) in the Matt Helm flick \"The Wrecking Crew\" is jaw-droppingly wonderful. And before we even get there, a scene of her just driving down the highway listening to music is just mesmerising.Elsewhere in the cast there are some memorable cameos. For me, the most prominent of these is Damian Lewis's turn as Steve McQueen. It's absolutely pitch perfect. So much so that I would love to see him inserted into a full-length recreation of \"The Great Escape\"!Much as \"The Nice Guys\" did such a great job of representing LA in the 80's, so here Tarantino's crew have done a bang-up job in recreating LA in 1969. Some of the street scenes are simply stunning and are works of magic. (I noticed that the Visual Effects coordinator here was none other than the veteran Star Wars/Star Trek genius John Dykstra). The costume department also did a great job, with the film dripping with nostalgia. This rose-coloured nostalgia angle I know has made some millennials gag somewhat. Racism isn't touched on at all here - aside from Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) the movie is wall-to-wall white. But in terms of \"macho-male-bulls**t\" the film reeks of it. I think we can also readily agree that this was a \"different time\", not a \"better time\".I know I've used superlatives like \"jaw-dropping\" more than once in this review. But in terms of the cinematography (by Tarantino regular Robert Richardson) and film editing (again by regular collaborator Fred Raskin) it's technically glorious. The camera swoops and glides over Hollywood, cutting from one scene to another beautifully. Some road scenes, of Booth weaving in and out along a highway at speed, are incredibly well shot.And so we turn to the writing and directing, both done by Quentin Tarantino. Here I pause in my praise.... since the film struck me as both brilliant and self-indulgent in equal measure. Is it sacrilege to say that this Tarantino is just a bit dull in places?In terms of brilliance, the film ducks and dives continuously. There are flashbacks and sudden cuts to parallel scenes that make you think \"where the hell does this fit in\"? But you are never left confused for long.As a \"director\", Tarantino is also a master at \"misdirection\". The rascal is continually setting you up for an expectation, often filling you with dread for what you are about to see - - and then he heads off in a completely different, tension-dispelling direction.But for me, many of the scenes in the film were flabby and self-indulgent. There were numerous \"driving\" shots, that always seemed to outstay their welcome by several seconds. What were they trying to prove? And similarly, many of the movie-making scenes seemed padded and slow. I'm always the first to complain about the lack of character development within most movies, and certain scenes - the ones between Dalton and Trudi for instance - were deliciously slow in achieving that. But I could have happily trimmed at least 15 minutes off the bladder-testing 161 minutes and I think it would have been a tighter and better film.Tarantino films are famed for their gratuitous violence, and this comes with a BBFC 18 certificate for \"Strong and Bloody Violence\". You could be mistaken for thinking that the BBFC had got this completely wrong for the first 140 minutes or so of this movie. Yes, there are numerous \"F-bombs\" dropped, and the promise of oral sex from a minor.... so it was never going to be a PG!All that changed in the closing scenes. But I have to say, I have seen far more gratuitous camera shots of the outcomes from violence in previous Tarantino flicks. Here, although the violence is extreme, Tarantino shows much-welcomed restraint in not showing much in the way of close-ups of 'bashed in faces'. As is common in his films, the violence also has a comical edge to it, being more cartoon-like in quality.Final thoughts: This feels like a slightly flawed masterpiece. Tarantino's Mona Lisa with a few accidental smudges. I think I feel obliged to leave it a week and go and see it again, if I can find the time. It's a film I think will grow on me with a repeat viewing. I think (on the understanding that you don't drink too much tea, coffee or beer before going in) this comes with a \"Strongly Recommended\" tag from me.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the interweb or Facebook. Thanks.)", "He's done it again!!": "My favorite film of 2019.Quentin Tarantino is my favorite screenwriter and is responsible for writing and directing my favorite movie, Pulp Fiction. And I've loved every single one of his films, even Death Proof. The lowest rating I've given one of his movies is an 8. So, naturally my expectations were high. The consensus with this movie is that it's one of Tarantino's weaker films. When I walked out of the theater, that was my initial feeling. However, I sat on it for a week, I decided that it isn't one of his weaker movies, it's just different. And there's nothing wrong with a talented filmmaker trying something different. Most of his movies are upbeat and vicious, but this one is very patient and mature. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting something like Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained. Or even The Hateful Eight. I've seen this film four times now and I think it only gets better with each watch. And I bought the book and it's amazing! I love you, Quentin!As with all of Tarantino's films:The characters are very interesting.The acting is superb.The dialogue is very well-written.The comedy is hilarious.The cinematography is perfect.The lighting is fantastic.All of the music is very catchy.The cast is awesome.It doesn't feel like it's 160 minutes. A complaint I've had with a few of Tarantino's films is that they have pacing issues. But here that wasn't a problem.During the ending scene there were two instances of very clever reincorporation.At first I had mixed feelings about the ending. As hilarious and satisfying as I found it, it felt out of place. This film was patient and mature, the ending was the exact opposite. It was very similar to the ending to Inglourious Basterds, which doesn't feel out of place in that movie. The opening is also in the same vein. But after coming to the realization that the film is meant to be a fairytale, hell that's given away in the title, I think the ending fits! As for the opening, after watching this movie four times, it doesn't bother me. I find it as entertaining as the rest of the movie.How Tarantino handled Sharon Tate was very tasteful. And that scene where she's watching her own movie was so very sweet. Some people say the way Tarantino handled Sharon Tate was disrespectful, I can't disagree more. It would've been disrespectful if he CGI'd Margot Robbie into Sharon Tate's movies and actually showed Manson's followers killing her.The following isn't a flaw but I felt it was kind of confusing, and I definitely would've liked to have seen this:Why didn't they make the scene between DiCaprio and Olyphant look and sound like an older movie? Earlier in the film they did that to a couple scenes, but for some reason they didn't do it during that particular scene. I just thought it would've been cool to see that.", "Nicely made pointless movie": "Definitely it should be acknowledged that this movie was nicely made from a technical perspective (filming, cinematography etc), and was accompanied by the professional acting of its well-known actors.\nBut downfall of this film is its disappointing plot. Some movies are made to build on and develop a story to deliver a message or meaning at the \"end\". Some other movies are just made to take the audience through a \"process\" and \"journey\" and through that journey they convey their meaning and message. This movie however was none of the two type I just mentioned. No depth in the story, long scenes that didn't necessarily play a role in the plot, as well as an ending that didn't even remain loyal to the real life incident. Not only me but also amongst the group of friends I watched this movie with, there was this sense of confusion about what was this movie trying to convey, even though we were not all foreign and new to QT's films and his brand and style of moviemaking.", "If I could give zero stars, I would": "First, the upside of this movie---the costuming, the sets, the look of 1969 Hollywood is excellent. The actors are obviously having fun with the movie and show that good actors can make even crap material look good.The downside of this movie---it's boring. It's nearly 3 hours of meandering camera shots, extremely drawn out, irrelevant scenes. There isn't really any plot to the movie. It's not a spoiler to say that the premise of the story is that some actors' lives intersect with the Manson Family. That's in all the movie trailers. I mean, Sharon Tate is one of the main features of the movie so you know that the Manson gang is going to be in the story.But, once again we go back to the fact that there really isn't any story here. It's just the director moving the camera around, watching people do uninteresting things, linking together scenes that really don't interrelate, almost none of them advancing anything that resembles a plot that would draw the viewer in. I actually fell asleep during the movie at one point and I'm certain that plenty of other people in the theater I was at were also catching up on their rest.The end of the movie is clever but by then the viewer has blown nearly 3 hours of his lifespan that he'll never get back. It's not worth it.", "Well made \"Trash\" Cinema": "Tarantino's movies are what I call \"well made trash\". The movies are exceptionally well made, directed, acted, etc while at the same time paying homage to trash/exploitation cinema of the 70s and 80s. This movie follows suit. It is extremely well written, acted, and directed. It is beautifully made. It is a \"what if?\" history-altering film which will be an issue with some and a delight to others. If the outrageous violently gory over the top ending doesn't elicit SOME reaction you don't have a pulse. I feel this is a polarizing film that people will either love or hate. Both views are understandable depending on what you wanted out of the film. You may get what you wanted and you may get nothing you wanted. Some would be better off watching the most recent Fast and Furious (which is no insult, if that's your cup of tea then kudos to you). I just hope you can at least enjoy the ending because IMO its one of the most entertaining 10 minutes of cinema in ages!", "Masterpiece that not everyone will like and/or understand": "Beautiful cinematography,great acting, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio look amazing on the screen.\nBut unfortunately our generation wants action and CGI in every corner so that's why not everyone will like this movie but it's sure worth watching)", "You either love or hate it. I LOVED it!": "I've always been a big QT fan and here he does something different but it is magical. The build up, the meandering of the plot that makes up the first two hours of the film can be thought of as boring but for me it was a beautiful way to set the scene of hollywood in the 60's and create an insight in the key players of the film. Apart from the outstanding performances of Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, for me the conversations, sentences uttered and interactions between the players is THE strength of QT. A very mondane conversation he turns into a piece of art.The power of the last scene however is very dependent on the fact if you know what happened in real life with Sharon Tate and Manson. I did, so loved what QT made of it. But a lot of my friends (over here in Europe where it me be a bit lesser known) didn't and therefore didn't understand what the fuzz was all about.So in conclusion, great performance, beautifully directed (oh yeah, loved the music in it) and unique plot (for those who are aware of it).", "Another masterpiece from one of our generation's best": "I walked into Once Upon a Time in Hollywood expecting a fun time and, as is usual from Quentin Tarantino, a great movie. But I was still blown away. Tarantino's signature nostalgic tone, cinematic flare, love for cinema and hilarious characterization are on display like never before. His sharp dialogue takes a backseat, but is still very present and loads of fun. His infamous violence, while less flashy than usual, is decidedly more palpable and riveting. And, in a shocking twist (spoiler alert), his signature bloody rewriting of history to create a version where the bad guys are defeated and burnt to the ground (think Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained) is very, very present and extremely welcome. This film feels less like a cohesive narrative, and more like a mix between a beautifully tangible display of the filmmaker's passion and an intimate character study of a man who can't seem to find his place in the world. Tarantino is clearly having the most fun of his career in this film, and we can help but sit back in awe and enjoy it with him.", "Easily in my top 10": "You are constantly expecting a large connection to take place throughout the film. The anticipation builds and Tarantino delivers!", "I'm so conflicted": "This movie was long and lacking in focus for most of the way through.The acting was superb, the cinematography was superb, the casting was superb however I felt it was lacking direction. Most of the way through the film I was unsure where it was heading and what the point was.The ending left me shocked, confused and seriously conflicted.I'm so glad this movie was made but I'll never watch it again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than a hardcore film buff.", "Another great film by Tarantino, Love letter to Hollywood": "Tarantino's latest film is here and it's probably his greatest yet. Both the acting by Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were fantastic and are some of the actor's best roles. The whole world that was created for late 60s Hollywood was all fantastic, the storyline was engaging and every character was interesting and entertaining. It's definitely some of Tarantino's best work and is my second favorite behind Pulp Fiction", "From an old fox facing directing challanges! \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0192": "Perfect script, where the cuts are sometimes self-indulging, the directing is less persistent or just to hard, esp in the beginning, where the actors hardly find their role, only to reaching their potential, as the movie unfolds. Script: 10/10, Acting: 8.5/10, Directing: 7.5/10.", "Mr. Tarantino, what have you done?": "Simply by reading the title of the review, one might think that I am disappointed or underwhelmed by the movie. Those readers could not be more wrong. The fact is that I am more than satisfied by what I saw, but am in a state of complete shock by not fully understanding what it is that I actually saw last night.The \"Tarantino love letter to L.A.\" is not a bad movie by any means (not that there is a bad Tarantino movie), nor is it a masterpiece, but every once in a while Tarantino gives us a movie like this, with a concept we did not expect (dare I say understand) and a \"story\" that is completely out of this world. Once upon a time... in Hollywood is a movie just like that.The acting. There is something about Tarantino that drives his actors to perform at their absolute best. DiCaprio (who I usually cannot stand with his trademark over the top performances) is an inch away from grandeur in this movie. His persona as Rick Dalton, his fragile personality as an actor and his almost perfect roles in the movie as well as the transition from one to the other is simply superb. Among others, he had the most complex and difficult role to pull off (with more than a dozen roles to play with not much screen time for all of them). His internal and external monologues and struggle to become something more that just a TV cowboy actor is (first) written beautifully and (second) executed in a splendid fashion. The contrast between his life and the roles he plays is a spectacular thing to witness, and I would enjoy to see it again (many, many times). He broke from his (Scorsese) typecast roles and actually showed the world that he can be a character actor (and a great one at that).Pitt was a complete contrast to DiCaprio. His character was tough, rugged, strong, down to earth, good looking (it is Brad Pitt after all) etc. By contrast to what his character was to be, his execution is more that just muscle-for-hire type of role. He understood that his role was to support DiCaprio's (just like their characters) and he executed it perfectly. The few single segments (especially the Ranch scene) he had, he literally stole every single second without breaking a sweat. The intriguing thing is that he did not, once in a 160 min movie, raise the tone of his voice or change the pace of walk (even in the most nerve-wrecking moments). He showed style and class in a role that was everything but style and class. His brute force is shown very briefly during the movie but is effective enough to make the audience understand with what kind of brawler they are dealing with (even if most of the characters in the movie didn't).Robbie has established herself as an AAA actress long ago. She is well suited for action, comedy, drama, comic book adaptations etc. Here, she proved that she is also capable of pulling of a tragic character with very, very little screen time. Her presence in the movie was more of a viewing experience (with drastically sharp and almost uncomfortable close-ups) and \"eye-candy\" than a multi-layered character (like DiCaprio or Pitt). But, contrary to belief, that was the point of her role. She was to be viewed as a happy, beautiful, full of life and joy character, a prototype of the up-and-coming star in that time. The fact that we all know what happened to her is what makes her such an in-corrupted character that we simply love seeing. Their triangle (the psychology of DiCaprio, the strength of Pit and the looks of Robbie) is what makes a good actor - then and now. Lose one of those and you have one of the three characters' fates on your hands. Tarantino knows this, and that is exactly what he wanted to show us. That is his formula for driving actors to perform beyond their possibilities with such ease.The story. As Once upon a time in... Hollywood is a character movie revolving around the three characters (and a whole bunch of other ensemble cast brilliance cameos) the story simply fades away. To put it quite truthfully, there is no story. This is a period piece, done to perfection in almost every segment, especially the atmosphere and surroundings. The run-time is not a real issue because it is not felt in any way as the \"story\" always changes and moves in ways that you don't see coming so it's never really boring. Herein I will use a strange construction that - it entertained me just like a Tarantino movie should, but the movie itself is not entertaining. It requires the viewer to think and carefully watch for every nook and cranny he put in there so that you can put the pieces together and understand what he actually tried to tell you. This will prove to be a chore for most moviegoers and most of them will not give this movie a second chance, which is a shame, because only upon second viewing will this movie really explode as the audience will know on what to put their focus on. It is brilliant, but it is not for everyone (this is not the MCU).The directing. There is a reason Tarantino is such a great director. He understands every set-piece, every character, every song ect. and what they represent and he know exactly how to show it to the audience. He does have an annoying trait as of late - the length. If this movie was 20-30 min shorter, the pace would be a bit more fluent and the characters would even out in their screen-time. But, as it is a trait, one cannot hold it against him too much.The atmosphere. This is what this movie is actually about. Feeling the atmosphere and life and style of the last days of 1969. The production value is through the roof, Tarantino knows it, and uses it to extreme lengths. He effectively immersed the audience in that time and gave them a ride they didn't expect (some of whom may have desired a different ride). But the feel of the movie and the suspense that is rising in the viewer (without a real explanation why that is happening) is superbly written, edited and directed.The ending. The signature Tarantino style aesteticized violence comes to full effect here, and with good reason. The tension that was building up throughout the movie actually explodes in the end. It is extremely meta and with more symbolism that the entire movie altogether, but is just a joy to watch (as this is actually Tarantino's way of saying - this is what I would do to those who did what they did back then). The final shot leaves the viewer wondering if it actually takes place in real time or if it is a surreal setting or is it something else. All in all, the ending will infuriate some, but that was not really the point. Look deeper into the meaning of the ending and you will see what it actually stands for.All in all Once upon a time in... Hollywood is not a masterpiece upon superficial viewing. It is not the best that Tarantino has ever made, but is far, far from the worst. It is a great movie with all the right buttons pushed except for that last one - the one where you have to think about what you saw instead of letting him show you everything. That button he intended for the audience to push for themselves. Only then will this be a masterpiece. If that button is not pushed, it's just a great movie to enjoy (over and over again). So, upon second viewing, try to push that button, it's worth it. Trust me.", "Overhypee because it's a QT": "If anyone but Quetin Tarantino made this movie it would be crucified by casual film goers and critics alike but since it is a 'QT' film people are wrongfully considering it a masterpiece.", "Genius people lose creativity too": "When genius people become older, they lose their creativity too. Unfortunately, this is another textbook example. If you run out of ideas, then you make a movie about what you know best. It this case, a filmmaker is making a movie about film making in LA. Definitely in a nice LA setting with a brilliant cast (acting was great). But that's it. No story and endless unimportant car driving scenes. Two and a half hours of boredom. Today it is no longer enough to show people driving thru LA with nice music (nowadays everybody can do this with GTA5).", "Most overrated director ever - and this yet again proves it": "Tarantino's biggest problem is he is surrounded by yes people. No one is there to challenge his self-indulgent way too long films. Again, they forgot to EDIT the film.The rule in the film industry: Get in as LATE in the scene and leave as EARLY as you can. Tarantino has it upside down. He gets in as early, leaves the scene running forever, and then leaves as late as he can. I.e lets shoot a bunch of random scenes because people will see anything these days. (smh)Tarantino started on top with Reservoir Dogs, which ran about 90 minutes, then after they went to 2 1/2 - 3 hours long, despite having material for 90 minutes.His lengthy superfluous dialogue scenes are the worst, but could be great if they were cut SHORT!Tarantino is a comedian telling a 2-minute joke in 45 minutes.It's a shame that Tarantino cannot cut his movies down to watchable films. And it isn't helping people with low expectations and tolerance to below mediocre films keep going to see them. Maybe because there are so many bad movies released that anything average is considered a masterpiece. We live in a world where people think the emperor wears clothes.I don't need to go into details, because there are already enough reviewers covering the boring details.Nothing happens, like NOTHING! Again, the repeated same old Tarantino self-indulgent drawn-out nothingness. It was like 2 1/2hours behind the scenes without any story whatsoever. Every 30 minute of so something remotely promising is about to start, but again leads to nothing.I was ready to shoot myself that's how boring this was. Oh, yes, totally disrespectful to the Tate murders...Showing Charles Manson as some dumb weak loser who never kills anyone, but instead gets beat up is really disrespectful to what happened to the real people that were killed. If you are going to do an alternative history, at least don't cheat people who don't know any better with the idea that no one died a horrible death. Like the couple Manson tortured and killed before the Tate murders. People who don't know better will walk away thinking nothing horrible happenedSkip it! Go watch Reservoir Dogs, his best film by far.", "Not as good as some of Tarantino's others": "Well made and certainly hits the late sixties vibe, but it takes a long while for the story to get anywhere.", "Genius.": "It's been 24 hours since I've seen it and I'm not sure I have digested the whole amount of information in this movie.\nYes, it is long. 2h 40min long. But I can't see one minute that could have been taken of.\nBut why so many fans find this picture so genius and me included?\nFirst you find all the elements he has been building through the years. Bounty Hunters in the Old West, Violence, Nazy Killings, and of course Hollywood (never forget The Man From Hollywood). It is now surprise in a Tarantino movie that is going to be carnage, but until the end, you are never completely sure how it will be.\nThan you got his narrative. This time it's not Like Pulp Fiction, with different stories told out of chronological order. It's at least three movies, one for each protagonist, all happening at the same time with a lot of flashbacks. Brad Pitt is hilarious without needing to do any effort for it. The Background for why the stunts coordinator despises him is fantastic. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a character so complex that you see his transformation between each character his character plays, and you see his struggle to be the best he needs to be to stay alive in the industry (the scene with Timothy Olyphant, when the camera goes back one shot is nothing less than a cinema lesson). But the most important is the construction of his Sharon Tate with Margot and the real footage of Tate. (To whom has no knowledge of what is about to happen it may be a little dumb at the end, but this is definitely the audience's mistake.)\nThe final part of the film is where it all comes together. At this part, you feel you know this totally fictitious character as their were real, after all, it's all so perfect mixed there with reality, that it could very well be real. By the time the three Manson family members get by their house something amazing happens, well to me at least. You KNOW he s narrating their entrance at the Polanski house, you KNOW this three will murder Tate and her friends, that he will say he is the devil and everything, but you are been fooled by Tarantino now, cheering for the lives of total fictional characters. The music grows tense and exciting every second and you want to make Cliff Booth do something, and not just stay stoned out of his mind. And he does it. And you will laugh. Loud and hard, because him, Francesca and Rick are about to change history.\nAfter the laughter is pass, something them, truly genius and unique happens. Jay Sebring Invites Rick Dalton to the Polanski residence, and in that moment, the door to Hollywood are opened. A very pregnant Tate receives him to his home and in the most brilliant way I've ever seen, the movie title comes up and with you close your eyes a little bit you can imagine yourself listen someone saying Once Upon a Time, in Hollywood... and let your mind wonder what a different world could have been if the Polankis had a Rick Dalton as a neighbor and a very stoned Cliff Booth as a friend. That is the moment when at least my laughter turned to a little sadness inside, for the different world that could have been.", "Yayyy": "Classic tarantino. Star studded cast. Easy to follow storyline. Wonderful plot. Would be better if it had Gary Busey in it", "Great if you love movies for movies sake.": "If you consider yourself a cinefile go see it. If not you might get bored. Fantastic film.", "Samuel L. Jackson's not in this! How good can it be!? Pretty good.": "Supposedly this will be the second to last Quinten Tarantino picture and from that preceptive, it's interesting how un-Tarantino this film can be at times, but what I did like is that he put these \"movie within the movie\" moments in this film that made you remember who made the overall project.\nCause the main story, about a wash up Actor and his stuntman best friend living next to director Roman Polanski and Charles Manson victim Sharon Tate won't do that.\nWhat you get most from the main plot is some amazing acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. They were shinning like true movie stars in this flick.\nAll the subplots about the world of Hollywood in 1969 is definitely Tarantino filled with so much trivia, cameos and innuendoes, it feels like he's trying to create his own Avengers: End Game.\nIf you like Tarantino the movie can be a little offsetting because on the surface it feels very different from everything he did before(It's these little parts of the picture here and there where he elongates the story that you can feel the Tarantino story style.)\nOtherwise, it's a real good movie to watch. Despite it's long running time at two and a half hours, it's rich with amazing content that always keeps my interest and was always amusing so you would never catch the audience sleeping.\nQuinton still knows how to make them!", "Twisted Fate": "Stellar performances from all the A-list Stars! Tarintino really transports you back into the 60's. He really makes you wait for it!", "Oh Tarantino.... no....": "Truthfully I wasn't sold from the start on this movie but as a Tarantino fan, I ended up budging. Honestly I could've done without. This movie is so random, I don't even know what to say. One of the things I think we all enjoy about Tarantino is the way he can build up a dialogue to let us into a characters personality. Unfortunately this movie is nothing but never ending scenes of Leonardo reanacting scenes from Darltons' movies/shows, leading us absolutely nowhere. It truly feels like Tarantino just wanted to geek out with this one. Introducing random characters like Bruce Lee for no apparent reason, but us fans we know, we know Tarantino likes him so it kinda makes sense, but to the story? Noooooot really. This movie is exactly that aaaaaaaall along. Two and a half hour of random scenes. Don't waste your time watching it.... I just gave it 5 stars for the ending and acting but that's it!\nPs; can we get the old Tarantino back? The one that uses \"old\" actors? Not huge names like Leo and Brad? They're great but it really kills the whole nostalgia, original and authentic vibe he use to bring us. Quentin, have you sold out just a bit?", "Neither Good Nor Bad Nor Ugly": "Patchwork is one word that comes to my mind when I try to describe this movie. There is, undoubtedly , a strong storyline that supports the sub plots , but one can clearly identify the seams.Just as the film tries to depict an era of transition in Hollywod, one can not miss a similar transition in Tarantino's directorial ventures. This transition was partially visible in Inglourious Basterds (2009) and pretty evident in Django Unchained ( 2012). The Hateful Eight (2015) could be called an exception, for despite the lukewarm reception it got from some quarters, it definitely is reminiscent of old school Tarantino. However , with Once Upon...Hollywood (OUH for short) Tarantino seems to have marched up to the precipice.There is abundant absurdism in the movie that is quite welcome. Tarantino also makes good use of most of his actors but they are undone at times by the patchy plots.It seems the whole film is grappling with irreconcilable elements, although each element in itself is fairly entertaining.The movie chugs along at a languid pace in the first half. The director succeeds in presenting an engaging picture of Hollywood and also treats the story itself respectably.The second half of the movie is only marginally quicker in progression than the first. But it is also the half where the movie falters a bit. On the one hand the turn of the plot is well arched and like any good story has a lot of implicit stimuli. On the other hand, the trajectory seems a bit wayward. The action sequences that appear are shot well and are gruesome ( as expected) and do balance the wheel.But there is always something that is missing in the narrative- is it the bite in dialogue? the sharpness in shifting between plots? Character development? Or the absence of substance in some scenes?May be it is just a phase that marks the completion of transition in Tarantino's film making.Whatever may be the case, the movie is a decent effort with some fairly\nentertaining scenes. I wanted to give it 7.8 . Alas would have to give the movie an unfair 7.", "Disappointing drivel.": "For most of the movie I kept asking my wife what the hell we were watching.The end was typical Tarantino, but it made little sense to end it that way. Out of character for our 'heroes' and silly. It was as if the previous 2.5 hours of movie was just for the last 10 minutes.I don't understand critics giving it a perfect, or near perfect, rating.The references to people and events from the late 60s was interesting, if not particularly entertaining. Music from the era was of course great, but that does not a good movie make.Margot Robbie's character was a total waste.At least you were intrigued by Pitt's and DiCaprio's characters a little bit.The scene with Bruce Lee was an abomination. I remember hearing the family was upset about it, and thought they should lighten up. But, it was an embarrassing bit of nonsense.I would never recommend not watching it, as it appears to be an acquired taste.I like Tarantino, and all the actors, but this was a slow, meandering, senseless mess.", "A homage to perhaps the most stylish era of cinema": "Left this movie with my jaw hanging. I don't quite know where I rank this movie among Tarrantino's best and I don't feel the urge to rank it. It was a film all of its own that told a fantastic love story with cinema in the most stylish era of cinema and turmoil. As always the dialogue was outstanding and I think he brought out the very best his cast could offer. What I think I loved the most is that the movie wasn't just one thing, there were so many transitions to the pace and style. Ultraviolence, great storytelling, and taught moments that glue you to your seat. It has so much rewatch value and I already want to watch it again.", "good movie": "Though slow at times, and some might not quite understand what the film is trying to accomplish. \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" is one part send up, one part reinvented history, one part fairytale, and all Quinten Tarantino. The film has great dialogue, a surprising amount of quiet moments, as well as phenomenal performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, this is definitely one film you don't wanna miss.", "The most pointless movie ever made": "I wonder how many stars this movie would have if it hadnt been directed by Tarantino and if Pitt and DiCaprio were not in it. This is the most pointless movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It has absolutely no story and the last 15 minutes takes the pace of the movie from 0 to 100 to the most gruesome massacre I have ever watched in cinema. This movie is an absolute pointless waste of time. I regret the living hell of watching it. Three hours of my life that I will never get back.", "Go watch it!!!!!!": "Man, I love this guy!!! Tarantino did it again! And I don't understand some people saying they were \"waiting and waiting\"... Yes, please, do wait. Because if you love-LOVE Tarantino's work, the end will not dissapoint you and besides, you know he makes long films, right?\nSo I sat back and carried away by the cinematography, the side stories, the whole mood of that era, the innocence and the dirt behind stardust, waiting for the escalation...\nDi Caprio was once more amazing, film by film, he gets so mature as an actor and the same opinion I have for Pitt too (I really enjoyed them together!), beautiful Robbie showed us an ambitious, yet warmhearted, young Tate (and knowing her tragic ending, made me feel more sensitive)... Little Butters was so cute, I laughed with Perry's appearance (such a loss this man), I see why Bruce Lee's daughter got upset, but hey, Quentin is a bit of a troll, yet he made a noticeable reference to that great guy....\nWell, when the narrator started preparing us for the awful night we know, I was getting really anxious, so Mr Tarantino was successful to his cause and then....\nI saw Maya Thurman Hawke leaving the picture all of a sudden and I was like.... Ok... Something's wrong here.... And this is where he leaves his mark!\nYou see, if you \"tolerate\" these 2 hours, then comes the plot twist! And YES, it has Tarantino's massacre, his view of justice (which I SO love!), his insanity and exaggeration! I saw his alternative universe of a terrible insident which I actually wasn't expecting and I deeply thank him for!!! If he eventually stops filming, I'll be very sad!!!\n*Moment I laughed hard: car was falling -Cliff!\n*Moment a tear came up: Tate invites Rick to her appartment -a new life chance for all of them", "Brilliant, ultra hip Paean to 1969": "Not for every taste...but Tarantino has given us the hippest most original American movie in years...DiCaprio is sensational and Brad Pitt literally re invents the word 'cool' ....a must for movie lovers and definitely a must for those of us who lived through 1969!", "Not a masterpiece nor Birdemic, and definitely not for everyone": "I just got home from the cinema, and oh boy I have I got alot of thoughts on this movie.Personally, I think that the acting was on point and the characters believable. DiCaprio, Pitt and the rest of the cast did a great job on this one. Even ten year old Julia Butters pulled off quite the performance, despite her age. The only times when you could see through the acting were during some scenes when they were acting in movies in the movie itself, but I suppose that was kind of the point.What I find truly mindblowing is how well Tarantino recreated Hollywood, 1969. The sets are simply stunning. Heck, it's almost like it's worth seeing the movie just to see the sets. Big kudos to him and everyone else who worked on them.There's one problem that I have with this film however; there doesn't really happen... that much. There's a bit of casual talk, some driving around in cars, some filming movies, but other than that, nothing really too interesting. It wasn't like I had plans on leaving the theatre since I had paid for my ticket after all, and some of the scenes were actually pretty funny and entertaining, Bruce Lee fighting Cliff for example.So, for the first two hours I mostly kind of just sat there, waiting for something to happen. Then, suddently, something did. Classic Tarantino kicked in, along with some castration by dogs and flamethrowers. Never ever did I think death scenes could be that satisfying, but I guess we are talking about members of the Manson family.So, to sum up this movie; not the best but definitely not Birdemic. If you're into non-stop action and majestic explosions, this film will leave you extremely dissapointed. In my opinion, the climactic ending kind of made up for the first two rather long hours of this movie. The sets were beautiful and the acting was very good, so with all of that in mind I am giving this movie an 8/10.", "Goddamn masterpiece!": "A masterpiece. The perfect embodiment of the 1960's. Another Tarantino masterpiece. Brad and Leo were masterful.", "The Oscar Sweep has arrived! Magnificence.": "Cliche to say, or not, but it's true. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a love letter to the Golden Age of cinema, from references to actors, to old commercials, to the rising change in culture, themes about career turnarounds, as well as a fantastic finale that I hope no one spoils. This deserves every Academy Award it could be nominated for. Simply amazing.", "Instant classic!": "People giving this movie a 1/10 Are probably people who will give transformers a 10 out of 10.", "A movie not about story but direction": "A movie portraying 1969 Hollywood and the changes it was encountering, was more about direction than it was about story. A unique in its own way movie showed us like 7 different kinds of directions. It was an excellent piece of art. And those who understood it, enjoyed it thoroughly!", "4 stars just for Margot Robbie": "I actually saw this in a theater and other than seeing Margot and the brief reference to the Manson family, it was a waste of time and money. Not nearly as good as the trailers released on this film.", "A beautiful international anthem to cinema": "First of all, I must say that I am a big fan of the director's work, I am of those who truly think that he is a pure genius. I am surprised and impressed at every movie, and this time wasn't an exception because I didn't expect what I saw.\nMoreover, it's the first Tarantino movie I see in a movie theater and the first I've seen released in my 2 years of passion for cinema so the experience is strongly increased. It's been 5 days now and I still can't believe what I saw, I don't know if I will be able to recover. seriously it has been the less boring and more interesting 3 hours of my life in a movie theater.\nOnce upon a time... in Holywood is once more different from what we were used to with Quentin, I don't think it is my favorite movie of his, but I truly think it is the more accomplished, mature and spectacular one. I wonder how could I not be disappointed for his next and unfortunately last movie after this one.\nTo start the real review\nthe actors are amazing, I mean, have you seen this casting? Even tough I still can't figure out where Dakota Fanning was, except in the opening credits... Leo and Brad are a great duo. I felt more sympathy for the stuntman and I think he is important to show the life of those who invest themselves as much as the actors but who remain in their shadows... And it's not the only profession concerned. Cliff became the handy man of Rick and it's unfair.\nFurthermore, Rick is also an endearing character, for whom I felt pity because he wants to be a better actor everyday but he doesn't get as much attention and opportunities as he used to. The filming scenes and the extracts of movies in the movie are impressive and immerse us into the universe of old westerns perfectly. And of course, Dicaprio's acting is stunning and I still love those moments when he goes wild.\nThere is only one true scene with Sharon but her character seems so young and innocent, I was so afraid for her because I knew what tragedy happened to her in real life and I thought it would happen in the movie. I was already crying when I saw the manson family arrive in her neighbourhood (hello to uma thurmann's daughter btw, good nod). But a Tarantino movie would'nt be a Tarantino movie without revenge, he's not afraid to rewrite the past and I love it! I couldn't stop laughing of enjoyment and astonishment when Rick burnt that b**** (hey inglorious basterds). The scene was so violent, yet absurd, it was raw Tarantino.\nQuentin is a huge cinema lover, particularly of the era you see in this movie, and you can truly feel his passion through this movie, which is beautiful.\nFinally, the sets were great, the story was touching and sad (first time for a tarantino movie) but still funny, to sum up it was both very different and just the same from every tarantino movie, great cinema.", "Yikes!

We want to have some thrills in our routine life. Some seek fame while others seek acceptance in some sort of movement. It's been like that since the beginning.

For most of the movie tarantino sticks to real events besides the inclusion of the two main characters Rick Dalton and Cliff booth -who are fictional - and added creative flair, this is until the scene where Sharon Tate played by Margot Robbie and her friends dine and the el coyote, at which point the movie leaves the tracks of biographical story telling to reach a more fictional destination. Tarintinos use of needle drops helps build the tension in the final scenes before the ultimately grusome but \"happy\" ending. The line \"you'll be a great mother\" is a chilling foreshadow into the real life outcome of the story. Overall tarintino directed a master class as all the stars shone, to make what will no doubt be a classic for years to come.", "A movie you can hangout with": "Honestly I just love to turn this movie on and hang with Cliff and Rick.

More than twenty years since QT made a serious movie -- one with character and style -- that movie would be Jackie Brown, a little seen classic. But here is an uber ambitious, complex, beautiful character driven feast. Yes there is a violent ending. But that is like 2:20 into the film and is totally telegraphed for the squeamish to miss. Most importantly this film feels close to QT's bone. Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown are, in my opinion two of the very best English language films of the past twenty-eight years. They are both perfect. Visually. Aurally. Character wise. Plot wise. But they are basically simple and rather juvenile stories from the ether, not from the director's heart. Here We get oodles about the craft of acting. Done, perhaps, more intelligently than anyone has ever done it. We get a kaleidoscope pastiche of old Hollywood from a million angles in glorious fifties/sixties colors like the automobiles of the time. It is not note perfect like pulp fiction. QT doesn't get the counterculture nor the music that defined the counterculture the way he has a seemingly perfect ear for the Motown and Soul music that was made during the same era. Some things feel wrong. Sometimes the plot wanders. But we see the craft and intelligence of the director. The wisdom and, yes, maturity. It could have been better, maybe, but hopefully it is a harbinger of things to come from one of the most talented directors of our time.", "Not the cinematic journey it should have been": "Being a big fan of Tarantino, I was looking forward to this but walked away feeling he had conned me out of a decent film or story. There is no denying Brad Or Leonardo's acting prowess and that is what gets the stars. Interesting to see Brad looking younger than Leo as each day goes by !The film didn't seems to know what story it was telling with the resulting mess that the story arc was flimsy at the most. The build up wasn't the right build up to the climax, which itself was more of a whimper than a climax (no matter how much you try and pad out with some QT violence). Margot Robbie's character could have been played by anyone with hardly any lines or real acting to do. Had any other writer or director pitched this film, it wouldn't have got any big stars and probably wouldn't have been funded - fortunately for the money men, they were guaranteed a return based on it being QT.the whole point of the film could have been done smartly in a 30 minute short story film.Very very disappointing and a real case of style of substance.....", "Absolutely Spectacular": "Written words cannot do this film justice, but I'll give it a shot.The first thing to mention is that I went into it almost completely blind. I watched the main trailer and nothing else. I was expecting a biopic with a Tarantino twist, and I suppose I got it.I don't want to say anything about the film's actual composition because part of the magic was going in blind. If you've read this far, you've read too far. Just go and see it. Then come back afterwards and agree with everything I've said.Usually when I finish watching a movie I take a few minutes or more to decide on my overall opinion, but that wasn't the case with this one. I've never been so quick to give anything a 10/10, and I once saw Billie Piper and John Barrowman in person.Speaking of attractive people, this film isn't exactly lacking in the looks department. With Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio leading as the Dynamic Duo of Dilfs, and Margot Robbie being Margot Robbie simultaneously, I was losing feeling in my feet from crossing my legs so hard.This film might legitimately be one of the best things I've ever seen. Not just one of the best movies, but one of the best things overall that's ever happened to me. If God himself decided to make a film he wouldn't be able to make one this good, even with the help of the mind-warping drugs that Tarantino undoubtedly uses as snacks when he writes his scripts.If someone were to tell me that I in fact hadn't watched the film and instead had done enough cocaine to kill a bear, set myself on fire, and hallucinated the whole thing, I'd absolutely believe them because that's exactly what it felt like to experience 'Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood'. Just go and see it, you'll never regret anything less.", "Tarantino's revenge on the Manson psychos": "In the late 60s, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a popular TV Western actor, finds his career taking a downturn and tries to recover with the encouragement of his kick-axx stunt double and best friend, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) & Roman Polanski are neighbors with Jay Sebring always hanging around (Emile Hirsch). Meanwhile the Manson Family nutjobs are lurking in the background, prepping to attack.\"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" (2019) is Quentin Tarantino's 9th full film and, for me, ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre. It may not be as great as \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) and \"Django Unchained\" (2012), but it places well with \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009), \"Jackie Brown\" (1997) and \"The Hateful Eight\" (2015).A famous director once succinctly defined a great movie as such: Three good scenes, no bad scenes. While the second part of this definition is debatable with \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" seeing as how the movie could've certainly been tightened up (there are some dull sequences), there's no doubt that it fulfills the first part.My three favorite scenes are: The amusing satirical Bruce Lee confrontation; the great Spahn Ranch episode, which effectively creates an underlying sense of menace; and, of course, the entertaining hippie attack in the final act.Thankfully, there are numerous additional gems: The friendship and respect of Rick and Cliff; the audacious flamethrower sequence; Rick's breakdown with the precocious girl actor (not actress); the beautiful women throughout; the great cast, including several celeb cameos; the entertaining soundtrack; Brandi, the pit bull; Rick's meltdown in his trailer; Rick finally pulling off a quality acting scene via ad libbing; George Spahn not remembering Cliff; everything (surprisingly) turning out to be precisely as so-and-so said; the allusion to what MAY have happened to Cliff's nagging wife (Rebecca Gayheart) on the boat; the way it should have turned out on that infamous night; and the heartwarming close,The film runs 2 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: A-", "Tarantino's Hollywood, or the Once Upon a Time... Hollywood": "Quentin Tarantino is one if not the most visionary director. She loves Hollywood and her older movies. He also makes references to them in his own works, be it the Kung fu films he cites in the Kill Bill films, inspired by Fellini's 8 1/2 film in the Dance Scene. It spins exciting or just thought-provoking lyrics into the mouths of its actors, which everyone then quotes without context. He pushes action scenes in front of us where he spares no blood and brutality. He selects his actors, but he still has favorites like old Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Uma Turman, Tim Roth or just Michael Madsen. Not even working with today's big guns like Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, or just Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt.\nTarantino loves to fetch a mystique for his films, such as what's in the bag that the two thugs keep, or whether Cliff Booth killed his wife or not.\nThis is where we get to the Once Upon a ... Hollywood. The film, which takes place in the late 60s, is the era when Quentin fell in love with cinema, for that was when he was a child. There's everything that mattered then, western (like in a movie, like a series, actors and directors like Steve McQueen or Roman Polanski, and the actor's wife Sharon Tate. Related to that is a sad and horrible concept, the Manson murders). .\nAccording to the story, a downtrodden actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), who plays only the main villains of the series, is just a neighbor of the Polanski, we can follow his everyday life with his stuntman Cliff Both (Brad Pitt), that's pretty much the story, of course. Manson family, how it would get into the picture would already be spoiler, so I'll just touch on their role in the film. Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate plays Tate with the simple but innocent, clownish charm, almost lubricating the role. After watching the movie, I said DiCaprio and Pitt would be there at the Oscars. Their pair is best put together. Brad Pitt's portrayal is restrained yet expressive. And Dicaprio plays with as much intensity, hysteria as a child whose toy has been taken away.\nIt may also be surprising that the series did not count as a high-volume format here as it does today. Today, the actors are killing for a good series role, at the time the series was considered a career cemetery.\nThe story of the film is not very voluminous, simple, but still easy to follow. The lyrics aren't as percussive as they used to be. Maybe there is only one monologue or scene, and that too can be linked to Dicaprio. That may be the only negative for me. The fact is that cinematography here (Robert Richardson) is what has a lot, more weight in the film than ever before. Because it mainly tells about street scenes, the backstage of a shoot, the screening of a film, how the people of that time lived their lives. There are few settings that are always there at Tarantino, but there are a couple. Such is the pointing of the legs. Let's not expect anything else from the foot fetish Tarantino. Not to mention the famous rear seat setup.\nThe music was also well sorted, here's everything, from Simon and Garfunkel to Mrs. Robinson, from Deep Purple to Kentucky Woman, the list would still be long, with a total of 22 tracks on the soundtracklist. It's good music, though it doesn't match the opening music of the Tarpaulin Novel with Misourlo or Kill Bill vol. For his 1st closing chord for The lonely Sheperd\nI now turn to the questionable and or more important parts of the film. First to the Bruce Lee case. When the film came out, the film caused immense astonishment to Shanonn Lee, the daughter of Bruce Lee. For he said that the scene in which his father was portrayed desecrated his person, that his father did not behave in that way. My view of this is that, on the one hand, Tarantino tended to knit together only the characteristics of the characters played by Lee and the figure emerged from it. On the other hand, there can be no complaint about the portrayal of actor Leet Mike Moh, no matter how strangely his character has been created.\nThe other one I want to deal with is the Manson sect. Tarantino only displays a scene to the extent of Charles Manson, not much to deal with. It deals all the more with his followers, who are generally young girls in their 20s and 30s, and a few guys. They are set up for simple hippies compared to being a serial killer sect. Although at the end of the film, they're pushing a bloodbath worthy of a Tarantino movie, not in any way. Their motivation, exceptional, is to kill as they saw it on television as an anno child. This is entirely true of Tarantino. It turns reality on its own. I would not say more about this part.\nOverall, it's an enjoyable comedy drama that, when viewed as a Tarantino film, isn't his best work, but it's not as immersive as the Grinhouse. Those who expect fast-paced dialogues, nerve-wracking action scenes one by one may be disappointed. In any case, I look forward to the master with excitement,", "Tarantino is simply the best!": "Like Inglourious Basterds, here's yet another brilliant twist on real and super sad events. Brilliant writing and directing. Oscar winner for sure!", "I had so much hope..": "Quentin Tarantino directing Brad Pitt and Leo. DeCaprio this was a dreamy colaboration for me, but it turned out to be slow painful 161mins of my wasteful life.\nIn order to rewrite history (again), Quentin tries to take normal viewers through the life of a fading, mid-life crisis facing former TV star trying to be a successful movie actor. This journey was so very stretched, slow and tiring!\nOnly Hollywood people can find any association with this movie, that is why it is beyond my understanding Brad winning all the awards for it when his past record of characters is way better, which involves more acting than just driving around.\nIf this is last movie of Qientin as being said, then it was his ode to Hollywood than his viewers.", "Tarantino made this no for everybody": "The movie is great, a very fun setting with huge characters. It's makes you believe in a what happens if? Charles Manson, Sharon Tate....Cool if you know how to enjoy it.Art it's not for everybody.Good Work QT", "All tension, no release. All build up, no conclusion. Waste of time.": "So what the FK is up with all these glowing movie reviews? Did Tarintino slip you all a Mickey or something before you watched this? Are you sucking his ck or something? Are you on his pay roll? This movie was NOT a 10 star movie. 6 maybe. If you're generous.Is it set in the 60s and has the music, costumes, and style of that time period? Yes. Does it have Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, and Leo DiCaprio? Yes. Do they do some good acting? Sure. Good music? Yeah. Then what's the problem? Well I'll tell ya:IT HAD NO POINT. NO PLOT. A movie can have everything but if it doesn't have a meaningful story then it's useless. This felt more like a fictional documentary than a drama, comedy, or movie. I mean where's the story? Is there a connection between some of the hippie characters and the main characters late in the movie? Yes, but it's tangential and not core relevant. Where's the overall story? The overall point? The conclusion? And was there an action scene in the end? Yes but it was hardly a climax, and definitely not worthy of a 2 hour build up.I mean I kept waiting for a relevant point or a final conclusion or a plot point you could hang your hat on and it never came. I mean Quentin Tarintino is a master of suspense, but all suspense and no resolution makes the suspense meaningless. It defeats the purpose. So even though this movie got the time period right it failed to provide a relatable story which makes it boring and a waste of time.MY conclusion: Some good settings and music, but no point. Skip it.", "One of The Best Endings Ever": "The movie was overall, not that exciting. I suppose it was more for those people (baby boomers), who remember 60s and the culture. It was still interesting but not really exciting during most of the movies.For my taste, it surely was no Pulp Fiction.DiCaprio was great in acting, as usual, yet his character was not really that interesting.\nBrad Pitt, whose character is far from interesting, was great. He played brilliantly, and his scenes were mostly fun.The ending, for sure, was great. Pitt, being high on acid, made it even greater.To me, it felt like Tarantino was sending a message to hippies of today, which are known as WOKEs, and i liked it.", "Best movie you will see in this generation, no contest!!": "Hands down best movie made in the past 20 years. It's no competition. Literally, if you love movies, this has everything you will ever need. Masterpiece!!!", "Boooooooooring": "Left after 45 minutes to do something more useful with my life. Taking out the thrash. Peeling a pack of salt. Anything really, but having to sit through this.", "Excellent Film": "Massive thanks to Quentin Tarantino for directing this film. Best since Kill Bill 2. Go see it this weekend.", "A review from a normal person": "I've never written a review on this site, and probably never will again. But i felt that the quality of this picture warranted such a thing. So here goes. The movie is great, and much of its success should be attributed t o its two main leads. Their chemistry and writing is something that makes me want to watch this film over and over again. If my word counts for anything, please listen to me and see this film.", "Entertainingly self-indulgent": "It's easy to see why Tarantino's film has been such a hit with film critics and film buffs. It's an ode to the movies. It weaves a story around showbiz icons and showbiz trivia. It is crammed with cute cameos. And it revolves around masterly performances by a couple of genuine screen legends. There's also something undeniably mesmerising about the era and the events around the Manson murders in LA. And the film positively oozes with Tarantino's enthusiasm for vintage 1960s Hollywood, and for all manner of sub-genres, from westerns to cheesy television to martial arts. But can we at least acknowledge that, for all the intoxicating nostalgia and quirky revisionist history, Tarantino doesn't really deliver much in the way of narrative drive. The film ambles along like a cowboy with three-day blisters. It shifts between scenarios that are almost devoid of dramatic tension (Sharon goes to the movies; Cliff fixes an antenna). And if it wasn't for Charles Manson and his crazies hovering over the proceedings there would be precious little in the way of suspense or dramatic tension through much of the movie. To that extent, Once Upon A Time is often a bit like a trip to a museum. It's often diverting. Occasionally fascinating. And you glimpse various different stories along the way. But it falls some way short of being a gripping, wholly engaging ride.", "IGNORE BAD REVIEWS IN HERE. PLUS THIS ISNT A FAKE REVIEW !": "I have had the luxury of seeing this film twice and loved it twice.\nIt's beautifully shot as a retro 60's film.\nThe clue is in the title \"once upon a time \" it's a fairytale,and Tarantino delivers one. The main characters are superb,everyone's expecting the story to be about the Manson murders but the twists are brilliantly done. Especially enjoyed the \"twist\" on Bruce lee.\nThe ending is incredible. The story isn't slow,it's all about leading up to the brilliant ending and unexpected ending. Plus WHAT an ending to a fabulous film", "You'll either LOVE it or HATE IT. I LOVED it": "If you're a child of the 60s, how could you NOT love this tribute to the special tinsel flavor of the time? QT captures the essence of all my young teen dreams. I especially adored the Playboy Mansion party scene where the people I wanted to be back then, gathered together in just the ways I imagined were so wonderful (and so sublimely ridiculous) and partied like it was 1969. This movie yanked me right back in history and the acting was phenomenal! There was tension, character (or lack thereof), a feeling of relief that my dreams never came true (although I've had that many times before) yet a delightful reminiscence and affectionate trip back to a fairy tale time in our culture. It would be hard for anybody who didn't grow up in that time to appreciate the genius QT used in constructing this movie so I expected it to be panned and disliked by the vast majority of movie goers. I was surprised to see so many 9s and 10s! The addition of the Manson crew lent a chilling reminder of how the times changed.", "Not my kind of movie.": "The action was SLOW and there was so much minutiae background building that it had me struggling not to fall asleep. It was a LONG movie. That was a dark time in the 60s when Manson was around, but the movie was so slow building that it had me looking at my watch to see when it would end. However the last 5 minutes was fast and furious in typical Tarantino form and had us all hanging on to our seats. I would not recommend this movie.", "Nobody will watch this again": "As a big fan if QT, this film was so disappointing. I can rewatch any of his past movies and enjoy it just as much as the first time I saw then no matter how much time passes. In 30 years I'll still watch Django. In 30 years pulpF and IngloriousB will still hit hard ect.. This movie was so boring I almost fell asleep. Literally nothing happens the entire movie until the last 10 mins. To anyone who says this is good you are insane. Unless you love to just watch something without any plot and people randomly doing scenes then this is a masterpiece. I guess QT is right when he says director's loose their charm after some time. Glad he's almost done.", "Couldn't finish it": "Managed to watch over an hour of this drivel before giving up. Was expecting a lot better but it was oh so boring, meandered aimlessly along without anything happening.\nOverrated piece of rubbish called a masterpiece by pretentious critics who have no idea.", "Love letter to cinema": "Although this movie is not for everybody, sometimes drags on without a seeming point, I enjoyed it very much.\nThe performances are solid and captivating.\nMargot Robbie shines, and Timothy Olyphant is an actor born to star in a Quintin Tarantino movie.", "Another conflated, self-absorbed Tanantino Film": "I'm starting to believe we have convinced ourselves Quentin Tarantino is a bit better than he is. Reservoir Dog's was great and Pulp Fiction a masterpiece. But we now know Tarantino ripped off Roger Avery and took much of the credit for Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown was good but not excellent, and Kill Bill, From Dusk 'til Dawn and Grindhouse were priceless. True Romance was another he ripped off from Roger Avery. But after all this, after he started solo projects; these films broke down to grandiose, self-absorbed entitlement. Inglorious Bastards and the Fateful Eight are prime examples of a narcissist without license, oversight or direction. They are boring, insipid, bloated and fatal, masked as marvels but sitting in our intuitive gut as failures. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the third installment of boring, far too long movies with excellent acting, cinematography and production that money can buy. But if you hated Inglorious and Hateful as much as I did, as the ultimate examples of movies as gaslighting, you will also hate Hollywood. I barely could stand it, writing this review as the gelatinous sand dune of a film progressed. We get the impression Quentin has his hand upon the beating heart of the culture and time period, and yet if we look closer, we see he perceives nothing at best, and a Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver he is not-in fact, nearly the opposite of. I guess I wish Quentin would have just stayed with what he knows, epitomized in Kill Bill, instead of making these massive bore-fests. However, the worst insult of all is making Hollywood absent of the effect of Manson, relegating him and the murders to a mere suggested subplot. I'm boycotting all future Tarantino releases for this reason only.", "One of the best movies I have seen in a while.": "This is definitely one of the best we have seen from Tarantino. As an avid Tarantino fan, I can say without a doubt that this is in the running for his best picture ever. The acting, the characters QT created, the cinematography, the music, the 60s vibe were all marvelous to encounter. A genuinely funny movie, but also suspenseful. A must-see IN THEATERS!! Would not want this movie any other way. Well done!", "Brad Pitt is HOT!!! Movie is too long...": "Went into this movie without any expectations. In fact, I thought I was going to hate it. The scenes with Leo could've been cut in half but the ones with Brad were amazing. The movie was too long but the ending was fabulous. I highly recommend it.", "Once upon a... fairy tale!": "This one seemed odd for Tarantino. There was a lot less blood that usual. The story was sort of bifurcated, with tangential contacts between the story lines. There is also a fun mix of fictional characters and 1969 Hollywood reality, punctuated by some pretty big Hollywood names. (Bruce Dern was perfect for the part he played.)Then, there was the end, when I finally understood the title. This Tarantino's idea of a fairy tale! And it was fabulous!That's all I can say without spoilers.Oh, and Brad Pitt's character is a badass. (Of course, I happen to think he is one of the most talented actors of his generation.)", "Boooooring": "I don't rush out anymore to see any more QT movies. I read a few negative reviews about this first and started watching it. The first 30 mins are boring and not much going on and seemed all over the place. I decided to listen to the reviews that said nothing happens on the movie and gave up.I'm hoping he does a new Star Teek to see his take on that but QT doesn't really excite me any more and is over rated like a lot of stuff that is churned out. Don't get me started on The Irishman.", "The Swinging 60's in Hollywood as told by Tarentino": "A love letter to Hollywood in the 60's this film is everything we have come to know and love from a Tarantino film, with a cleverly written script; witty and humorous dialogue; complex and interesting characters encountering various misadventures all set against the vibrant backdrop and upbeat soundtrack of the 60's.\nArtfully done, I was thoroughly entertained the entire 2 hour and 40 minute run time but then again I know Tarantino films are a slow, delightful burn, which is why I have always been a fan. In today's age of instant gratification, this may be unappealing to more than a few, but for the die hard Tarentino fan, this one hits the spots just right.", "One of Tarantino's best!": "I have not much to say except for this may be one of Tarantino's best films of all time. Yes, there were a few slow parts but that doesn't make the film any less amazing. Great characters, awesome plot points, a hilarious yet brutal final scene with a plot twist that we didn't expect. It's perfect!", "This is what true film it's about..": "No matter politics, economics, or global standards film its to open the eyes of the audience to other reality or their own. As usual tarantino find the perfect balance. Masterpiece", "Amazing cinematography": "The movie is obviously not for everyone like any other 3 hour long movie. BUT if you stay till the end you will see the entire set of beautiful cinematography from the first 2 and a half hours collides in to a final half and hour Tarantino classic. Finishing scene is one of the best in movie history, but you have to watch the whole thing to get it. I enjoyed it and laughed like a child. Loved it!", "Tarantino and Hollywood hit back": "What do Quentin Tarantino and Pedro Almod\u00c3\u00b3var have in common? A lot, of course. First of all, both are among the most important film directors of the generation with which we have the chance to be contemporaries. Each of them released on screen at the Cannes Festival this year a film that deals with the world of film and its heroes. Films belong to the category I call 'movies about movies', an apparently narcissistic preoccupation of cinematography, but one that has resulted in many memorable films. Apparently Almod\u00c3\u00b3var's film, 'Pain and Glory' is more personal, many of those who saw it defined it as autobiographical. I dare say that Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in ... Hollywood\" is largely a personal film, which tells a lot about the American director who is still threatening us to put an end to his film career. It tells it of course, in his own special style. The Tarantino style.The most frequently heard criticism of this film is the one that claims it is too long. Maybe it's a justified claim. Maybe out of the 161 minutes of screening, 20 or 30 or 40 could have been cut out and then there would have also been a better balance between the two episodes that make up the story, episodes which take place six months apart, in 1969. But I must confess that I enjoyed each of these 161 minutes. Tarantino managed to transport us in his version of that year at the end of a decade that transformed America and the world, into the universe of the movie studios and in the Hollywood streets populated by famous actors and hopeful extras, by hippies and riches, a puzzle of bright kitsch and contrasts. I enjoyed the episodes from the films and television shows of the time, and I enjoyed sharing with the character of Sharon Tate, the starlet with a tragic destiny, in the darkness of a cinema hall the spectators' reactions to her acting in a supporting role in her last movie. Tarantino was only a child that year, but his insider vision over time, the combination of reality and imagination, between vintage films and his own implants works very well.Tarantino also provides to Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt the opportunity of some of the fine roles in their fine careers. DiCaprio is fantastic in the role of the actor who feels his career is fading out and that his age catches behind before he managed to impose himself as a great star. His character is a combination of kitsch and self-doubt masked by boasting. Pitt ris his partner, a very Tarantinoesque role, and he again demonstrates the good reasons why he is the director's favorite actor. Even Al Pacino finds the opportunity in this film to play a sapid and important supporting role in the story. For much of the film, we have the illusion that Tarantino has renounced explicit violence as a means of cinematic expression. The last part of the film proves us wrong, the ending is spectacular, one of these that we expect from him, spectacular not by the graphics of violence (which is not lacking) but by ideas. Same as he has recovered in other well-known and controversial historical episodes, such as World War II and the Holocaust or civil war and slavery, Tarantino does not hesitate here to rectify history and to make justice, the way he knows to do it, a la Hollywood. Exaggerated? Implausible? Let's not forget the title of the movie. Fairy tales can be a source of serious lessons but the genre is not obliged to adhere to historical truths. In addition, we can, at any age, enjoy their beauty and charm.", "I don't like this Movie. I LOVED IT!!!": "I don't like this Movie. I LOVED IT!!! This is the most outstanding Film I've ever watched. That Film deserves an Oscar for Best Picture! 10/10", "Crazy ride that you shouldn't miss!": "Absolutely loved this movie. The acting was superb, Leo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Brad 100% deserved the Oscar. Story was captivating, 1969 setting amazing (as is the music) and at moments was at time's a laugh riot. The ending. OMG wait until you see the ending.

Leo was great, Brad was Brad (he's not a bad actor, but has done better) and i find it ludicrous that he won the golden globe for this role that required almost zero range as an actor. The movie is ultimately very forgettable and an utter disappointment for any QT fans expecting something edgy and original.", "You have to watched as it's own way": "I get it , not everyone have lo love a movie but many of the comments are like \"not plot\", \"to long\" and I get it. This movie is not like a normal QT movie , there is not enough story but that's not the point of the movie , this is a love letter to hollywood , a enjoyable ride with remarkable scenes, the point is not to make tension ,not to make a complex story. Is to transport you to Hollywood, and showing a life of an actor, QT make a really artistic movie. But thats my point. I think you should watch it but you have to watched as it's own way.

I'm about to give up on all movies and wait 10 yrs until they are shown on cable.", "Feet shots have never been this gratuitous": "I'm gonna get my one negative feeling for this movie out of the way before I start sucking Quinton Tarantino's toes. The decision to change the historical events for a happy ending I personally feel was the right way to go, especially for a movie that feels like Tarantino's personal wish fulfillment (not a bad thing). However this wish fulfillment makes an odd point, and I don't think it was intentional. If Sharon Tate's death was seen as the end of that era then symbolically this movie shows a world where those times didn't have to end. But isn't it weird that the symbolic death of the sixties at the hands of an extremely violent act was prevented by another extremely violent action, and I'm not saying the psycho hippies were victims, I'm just saying that ending you're movie on that point feels odd.That being said I still love the movie. Every shot, and every song, and every moment the characters don't wear seat belts makes you wish you could live in that time. And that's why despite my complaint I have zero problem with the ending. Because my heart is warmed by the idea of a universe where the hippie movement got to live a little longer, Sharron Tate's career could be fully realized, hitchhikers could still get rides, and acid could be 50 cents. I even found myself on the ride home listening to classics from that decade just to keep that warm nostalgic feeling going, and I wasn't even alive to experience that time.Despite its simplicity in its intention once upon a time in Hollywood manages to be the perfect sum up of Tarantino's career, a lot of cigarettes, feet, and an overwhelming sense of longing for a time you know no one will ever get to experience again.Also I burst out laughing when Margaret Qualley had her feet pressed against the windshield of Rick's car, and I feel so bad for being disruptive like that, but I think we can all agree that whole scene was the peak of Tarantino's foot fetish. That shots gonna circulate among guys who like feet for a long time.", "Worst movie on the year": "I don't want to spoil anything for anybody but this is a waste of time. It is the worse acting I've seen in an \"expensive\" film. Pitt did not perform to Oscar heights. The handling of Sharon Tate in the end is hideous and so troubling.

No character development, no story driving this movie forward! My last Tarantino movie!", "Unwatchable": "I love Tarantino films but I couldn't even get through half of this movie. It's boring with boring characters and no story.", "Mature, lovely and blood.": "It's a calmer film, contained and full of references. Despite all this he doesn't lose the touches of Tarantino, all the time you're reminded that you're watching a movie of Tarantino, his whole montage and driving is still very present in the whole movie. In the end we finally have the icing on the cake, the typical Tarantino energy and adrenaline injection and at the right time.", "Absolutely stunning": "I don't know how to describe what I felt during the movie, I had a constant smile for the fantastic locations, for the fantastic camera movements, the well-constructed and dynamic dialogues, and Oscar-worthy actorial performances.\nIt's not a movie for everyone, but if you love cinema, the art of filmmaking and storytelling, you'll love this movie.\nIn addition it is one of the few films that after having seen it, you think about it for days and you always want to go deeper and watch it several times.\nJust wonderful.", "I'm just giving this ten stars for the last scene": "I'm not gonna lie, the first two hours and thirty minutes of the movie, I was laughing, but I didn't get the hype. Wasn't much of a plot, just a bunch of random scenes. But then the last scene with the hippie slaughter fest was literally the most hysterical thing I have ever seen on TV. My friend and I were laughing out asses of the entire time. 100% worth it to get to that scene.", "One of Tarantino's best": "It has some of his best writing and probably his best characters. All of the cast is great (especially Brad Pitt). If you like movies, I highly recommend for the cool Hollywood aspect and a filmmaking aspect. I would've been perfectly fine with it being 4 hours long, they should make a extended version like how the did with The Hateful Eight", "GENIUS!!!! BEST MOVIE ALL TIME": "This is absolutely my new favorite movie of all time. The performance, the plot, the tones in the film. Everything just works together and I cannot imagine it any better. You either hate the movie or you love it. Brad Pitt and Leonardo Decaprio have a beautiful bromance and Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate to the T. Even the way the movie was filmed the angles and scenes were just jaw dropping. The car scene at the beginning definitely sets the tone and the Easter eggs pay homage to the final days of the Golden age of Hollywood. I highly highly suggest watching a documentary on the Manson Family if you're not familiar with the story because There are subtle shots throughout the movie and characters that play major role in the plot and the actual real events that you would not catch. The ending was just fantastic and Brad Pitt nailed it. It might be slow for some people but for me the pacing was perfect even with the actual events the Manson Family cult started off as peace love hippies and Charles Manson over the years turned on Hollywood after they rejected him for his failed music career which correlates with the narrative. You have to know the story to get the movie. But yeah the movie was absolutely brilliant and incredible acting.", "God awful, slow , boring & pointless": "Complete long winded, really pointless. No idea what is wrong with all the actors who thought this was a good use of there time! Wasted my life watching actors in a abysmal film. Long scenes and dialogue for no reason at all.", "Great all-around": "The movie was beautiful and the pacing was pure art", "when a semi director losing rest of his mind": "What is that garbage Mr tarantino? do you think people are stupid?\nno, you are stupid with such crap movies. time to retire Mr tarantino.\nyou are finished after pulp fiction.\nGuys who give rewards to your crap garbage, are stupid than you", "Gods amongst men": "What can i say? One of the greatest films of 2019. You got the Gods themselves BP and Leo himself. Legends . And of course your in amazing Hollywood, great seeing the streets and stuff we've all taken before. I really enjoyed that, along with the great supporting act of Brad Pitt with Leo. So many good and funny scenes, i loved this film. It was solid acting by everyone and a great film to watch with your friends. I reccomend everyone to watch this.", "The Apex of Tarantino's 9 films...": "Although \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" imbues an inchoate aura, it does - however - succeed in its depiction of the antiquated beauty of cinema during the 1960's. It's redolent presentation of this era also contains outstanding cinematography, with DiCaprio's visage and bravura of \"Rick Dalton\", who is meticulous in his representation of the character's impediment. As for Pitt's \"Cliff\", the character offers an insight into the adroit of a stuntman - whilst also elucidating Cliff's ingrained intonation, which ultimately coalesces Rick Dalton's act. Forbye, DiCaprio and Pitt out-perform one another, whilst Margot Robbie further augments this idyllic image of retro Hollywood; irrefutably, this picture is the superior of Tarantino's 9 films, which merely adumbrates his intentions of the 10th and final film he shall direct - will it be his best?Initial Rating - 8.9/10", "QTs third best film": "QTs homage to Hollywood is a thoroughly enjoyable affair, if a little overlong. Although the film is chronologically linear, you could quite easily miss a good chunk of the film and not feel you've missed out. The film was effectively a series of vignettes that you could easily dip in and out of. Now I've seen the whole film I'll happily watch one or two stand alone vignettes and be thoroughly entertained. I found myself a bit annoyed at first in the 'sox months later' section as it seemed utterly absurd and out of kilt compared with the previous 2 hours. Yet it was the most enjoyable laugh out loud sequence of the whole film. So it worked. QTs finest for many years - I loved it.", "Way too long... missed direction": "Another missed opportunity. So much muscle power waisted in an irrelevant story missing direction and momentum. I was seriously bored even though the scenography was truly great", "Missed the mark for me": "I love QT. Love the Kill Bills, Pulp, Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs, Death Proof...but this one missed the mark for me. I didn't find the dialogue witty or clever as it usually is. I didn't find it very funny except once with Leo lamenting on being a has been and the Bruce Lee scene. To me the Bruce Lee scene was the best part of the movie. That scene had the witty clever feel to it and the fight was both funny and realistic. I also appreciated all the QT favorites showing up like Zoe Bell, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, and Red Apple cigs to name a few.Like the fictional fantastic ending of Inglorious Basterds, I was happier with this ending but without the real deal what was the point of developing the Sharon Tate character? I do think the acting was absolute topnotch especially from Leo, Brad, Brad's dog, and the little girl, Julia Butters, who stole thunder from the big guns. However I was often bored throughout the movie. There was too much down time with zero dialogue. Lots of driving and walking.I was just overall disappointed but I still love QT and always will.", "Not Tarantino's best": "This movie is not Pulp fiction, Reservoir dogs. It's not even Death proof. When I say this movie is not Tarantino's best, I mean it's Tarantino's worst movie he made. That still makes it an ok movie to go and see, an average movie. Five out of ten stars. I could say that Brad Pitt and Leonardo have no chemistry like Travolta and Sam Jackson. But they really did the best they could with an average script. Yes, I said average. An average script from the genius himself.\nThe pace of the movie is horrendous, the movie moves very slowly while absolutely nothing is happening except for the classic Tarantino's ultra violence in the last 5 min of the movie.\nNow, don't think I am all about the violence. I like Tarantino for his dialogue and characters. Not in this film, like I said the script is average. The characters forgettable, it is Tarantino's fault.", "The Manson story in a parallel universe.": "I loved both the acting and the story. Brad Pitt shows a maturity playing \"The old guy\", and DiCaprio is spot on as the self absorbed, insecure fading star. The ending is classic Tarentino with a twist that caught me totally by surprise. I will watch this movie again. Loved it!", "(In)Glorious Doubling": "\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a thoroughly self-reflexive piece of revisionist nostalgia of Hollywood and its motion pictures--theatrically screened, televised and drive-in. That the leads are an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) underscores this. Live-action film (and it's important that this one was actually shot on celluloid instead of digitally) is fundamentally a process of reproduction, or doubling; it's a photographic copy and imitation of reality, which in turn is reproduced manifold in its public distribution. Likewise, Pitt's character doubles DiCaprio's in the films-within-this-film; he pretends to be him while performing manful feats, while the actor pretends those acts for himself. Like film, they are of two characters in one. On top of this, the narrative involves both their past glories and present struggles in the movie industry. Although in many other films, such self-referential doubling tends to play out as haunting doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers or whimsical twins, here we mostly get a buddy picture. Moreover, Pitt is not DiCaprio's exact clone and obviously neither is \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" faithful to the history it enters.I'm so fond of this meta filmmaking--beyond the more limited simple borrowings, homages and recollections that occupy director Quentin Tarantino's entire oeuvre--that I'm tempted to overlook how hollow and self-indulgent much of Tarantino's cinematic insight has ultimately turned out to be. The indiscernibility in style between the outer film and the inner TV episode in a sequence where DiCaprio's aging star plays the baddie is especially well done in the former regard. But while entertaining and well constructed in its mirroring itself, Tarantino often wanders into mere pastiche and even into making a pastiche of his own prior movies. The nostalgia is likewise immoderate--contributing to an often cluttered and meandering trip down memory lane that would've benefited from further cuts. Even the full display of the title, with its ellipsis, is indicative of the roundabout nature of the picture. And after lulling the spectator with series upon series expressing his eclectic pop-culture tastes and sentimental reminiscences, Tarantino resorts to an all-too-familiar Grand Guignol finale to satiate said spectator's, or at least his, assumed lust for ultraviolence.Contributing to the languid pace is the adjacent story of Sharon Tate and the Manson Family. Much of \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is ripe for a film theory thesis in the Laura Mulvey tradition concerning the alleged objectification of women through the cinematic male gaze. And perhaps Tarantino and company cultivated the era placement of this film, sepia tones and all, so much so that they adopted the treatment of gender by the kind of films Mulvey criticized in her essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,\" published only a few years after this film's 1969 setting. While most of the focus here is on the emotional performance of DiCaprio's actor and laid-back gallantry of Pitt's stuntman, central to the masculine/feminine dichotomy in the picture is the role of Tate (Margot Robbie), who's mostly a mute, idle and passive object to be looked at--by the active male characters within the film and by the spectator meant to identify with those men outside of the picture. There's also the casual inclusion of uxoricide, let alone the fact that this is Tarantino's first film after the public disgracing of his former producer, Harvey Weinstein, to raise the ire of anyone dissatisfied with the picture's gender imbalance. There's also the unmentioned (within the film) subsequent rape by Roman Polanski, although one may suppose that this is alluded to and rebuked in the scene where the stuntman refuses the advances of a girl absent identification proving her adulthood.Regardless, one scene with Tate here is interesting by playing with assumptions about the power balance in the cinematic gaze. In it, she attends a theatrical screening of one of her films--joining in the gazing upon herself and, all the while, reveling in her doubled to-be-looked-at-ness as the audience enjoys her performance on screen. It's a terrific mise-en-abyme that separates the real Tate with her double in contrast to the obliteration of that separation in the sequence involving DiCaprio's actor filming the TV episode. Additionally, it gives an agency to the Tate character that is otherwise denied in the film, including her as an unbeknownst damsel-in-distress for the denouement akin to the victims of Henry Fonda's gang in the film for which Tarantino is presumably giving a nod to with the title of his own quasi-Western and with all of the spaghetti Western references--\"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968)--and denied to her more horrifically in reality by her murder at the hands of the Manson cultists.It's because the victims of injustice were the active agents in Tarantino's prior forays into historical revisionism that his ultraviolent climaxes were more satisfying--from righting the wrongs of Nazis in \"Inglorious Basterds\" (2009), to slavery in \"Django Unchained\" (2012) and, somewhat, even fixing racism of the Reconstruction era in \"The Hateful Eight\" (2015). Plus, at some point, if you keep employing the same gimmick, fatigue sets in. \"Inglorious Basterds\" even mixed that ultraviolence with cinematic self-reflexivity, and unlike here it did so by combining them in a theatrical showdown. There, it wasn't just a film where Nazis were scorched in flames (which also happens in this one), nor did it merely flame out in an orgy of brutality; in it, too, the film caught fire. Here, instead, we get smoke, or rather and literally, lots of smoking caught on film.", "The IMDB ratings let me down this time": "I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as I didn't want to miss on three historic movies this year. The highest grossing film of all time in Avengers End game, and that movie is also supposedly one of the greatest movies of all time, the 9th highest grossing movie of all time in the Lion King, and this movie, which is rated as one of the greatest movies of all time. I don't care at all about seeing the Lion King as I'm not a child, and I was too slow to get around to seeing Avengers End game before it left the movie theaters. The rating system worked out perfectly when there was a high rating for Bumblebee, and I enjoyed that movie very much.The rating system let me down immensely with this movie. It was just awful. The acting was solid, and that is all I can say positive about this movie. The movie was just plain boring until the end. More specifically, the movie felt like it was aimless. It seemed to have no point, or at least no point it was in any hurry to get to. A lot of the scenes felt pointless or unnecessary in advancing the plot. One of my biggest complaints from a technical standpoint was Tarantino's pacing was awful. Unlike the superb pacing of films such as Bumblebee, John Wick, Black Mass and Hell or High Water.I hated everything about the movie. I hated the feel, I hated the dialogue. I even found Tarantino's foot fetish to be cringey and forced. When he had the naked feet on camera several times I was like rolling my eyes that this was so Tarantino-cliched and forced that it was cringey.Even the exciting part at the end seemed forced and as if it was tacked on just to give it a climax. This is because it came out of nowhere. From what I recall at least, there was nothing prior to the attempted mass murder that would let you know the four were planning it. It was sprung on the audience ad hoc if you will.It was funny because in the theater I was in, 3 Hispanics that were together walked out on the movie about 40 minutes before it was over, and that was actually the most exciting part. Man I hated this movie. I could tell by 22 minutes in it was not going to be any good, but I had no choice but to give it a chance since I paid $13 for it. So I was hoping it would get better, but it never did until the very end.Another thing about the movie I hated was the narration. I kept thinking about Cinemasins on YouTube and them constantly complaining about exposition; which this movie did a lot of. I even checked Rottentomatoes to make sure the high rating was legit, and it also had a high rating of 85%. I'm not sure why the rating was so high. The script lacked cohesion and cinematic momentum building if you will. A perfect example of cinematic momentum building is Hell or High Water, Quills, Scarface, John Wick and Training Day.I also hated all the parts in he movie where it was just music playing with the scene and no dialogue. It felt like too many times in this movie it was just a music video or musical concert.", "Another Quentin Tarantino classic": "Quentin Tarantino has some of the best movies and this is definitely one of them another Hollywood classic about Hollywood movies", "Why??": "Half of the theatre was sleepy and we were happy that the movie was over, no story nothing, total waste of time and expectations", "60's Hollywood Eye Candy With Great Performances": "This movie is definitely not for everyone. It's a slow burn with amazing camera work and cinematography. The amount of work that went in to making Hollywood look like the 60's (70's) again is incredible.Does the movie feel a little bit long, yes. I regret going tired to a late screening. I could hear people complaining about being bored leaving the theatre. This movie isn't for your average blockbuster viewer.If you want to watch a master class in cinematography and character development go check it out. If you like CGI explosion/monster/shoot em up movies, skip this one.", "definitely not for everyone": "If you like to see sime plot or a story this movie is not for you. please stop reviewing if you're dumb", "Once Upon A Time in Hollywood gut reaction:": "Once Upon A Time in Hollywood gut reaction:I really enjoyed it. A few things that I could see as potential negatives for general audiences: it has very slow pacing and is lacking a traditional plot structure, which tends to provide most films a compelling narrative. It is similar to his film Jackie Brown with its pacing. Also a bit on par with Pulp Fiction in terms of the storytelling approach/style. In essence, it takes its sweet time and doesn't have a straightforward plot. It's about two former Hollywood stars facing the reality of being washed up in the late 20th century. So, if you're a Tarantino fan, you'll enjoy the film regardless of the aforementioned \"negatives\", and perhaps, like me, will want even more runtime to enjoy. I absolutely gush and ultimately \"eat up\" the way QT shoots his scenes, writes his quirky dialogue, etc. I joyfully soak in every frame of his movies, no matter what. I'd see a film about landscapers mulching a house if he made it. To the shock of probably nobody, the ninth film by QT has great performances from the whole ensemble. Especially Leo. I'm still digesting that eight course meal of a film, but I really enjoyed it. Quentin Tarantino does a masterful job at delivering a comedic love letter to honor old Hollywood movies, especially the indie-western genre of old. Go see it!", "The one thing this sublimely directed film is missing is, well, direction": "First Tarantino movie, oh boy. My plan was to watch Pulp Fiction before going into this but I ran out of time. Doesn't matter however. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood will not be immune to common flaws Tarantino films may or may not have over the years of their production. That being said, I enjoyed this movie and think the positives outweigh the negatives, despite the negatives being pretty damning from my perspective.I understand that not everyone is going to have the same experience as I did, and that's fine. I almost don't want to use my bullet point format now, seeing as this one needs more than a sentence or two per point to explain how I felt about certain things. I will also be marking this as containing spoilers against the will of Mr. Director, because some stuff I have problems with happens at the cost of explaining the plot. We'll start with said stuff.* Margot Robbie, also known as Sharron Tate, has absolutely zero impact on the plot whatsoever. We keep cutting to her like she's important, but nothing she does influences anything. I get now that I've done my research that this is somewhat based on the real life events of her death. But this movie doesn't do that. The ending is amazing, but she doesn't die like in real life. We have scenes of her sitting in a theater. We have scenes of her dancing to music. Neither of which influence her character, neither of which are even setup to the climax. She's just nothing.* This segways into my other big issue: It's too long! This movie did not need to be 3 hours long, at all. Half the movie is just filler! Entertaining filler? Sometimes. Well directed filler, absolutely. But filler nonetheless. You could have easily cut the movie down by at least half the runtime. Cut Margot Robbie, cut the multitude of driving or dancing sequences, cut the subplots that go nowhere, and you'd have a tighter movie. Because for chunks of the movie the plot is meandering and meaningless, and the nearly 3 hour runtime begins to feel like a full day.* Sloppy narration. It's not only inconsistent, as it only happens during the first 10 minutes and last half hour, it's just explaining what we already see happening on the screen. Apparently this is a trope of his. Oh boy.Those are my seriously major issues. However, for as much as I dislike those aspects, this movie has some seriously amazing things.* Fantastic direction. Despite the plot and events having zero real direction for half the movie, the camerawork, the way Tarantino made the movie, is so dang good. Long shots, well edited sequences, the acting, lord it's so good. I'd recommend this movie based on that alone.* Fantastic production design. The sets, the lighting, the costumes are just... mmph! So good.* Leonardo was great. He really immersed themselves in his roles within roles, and he gives probably one of the best performances of the year. Brad was really good as well, I love the intrigue behind his character and he has easily the best scenes in the movie.* When the plot wants to do something interesting, I was on the edge of my seat. The abandoned Western set sequence was uncomfortable in all the best ways.* The climax is just amazing. Did we really need to sit through 2 and half hours of not so needed stuff to see it? No. Was it worth it? Yes. It's so satisfying. The gore, the reincorporation, the dog?* Brad Pitt pets the dog. +1 star.Bottom Line: Does this movie work? Yes. It could have stood to be cut and given some characters something to do. But overall it's a damn interesting movie. I'd still recommend it regardless of my problems with it.", "Short and sweet review": "Great performances that are definitely Oscar worthy. It does feeling a bit long at times but the climax is worth it . All in all an amazing time at the movies.", "Understated": "Awesome title, makes you think.. What if? What if those horrible people would have gone to the adress next door to Sharon Tate? What if... What if they would have had their asses handed to them instead of the tragedy that happened? Ohh you know what!? I hope this movie, actors, producers etc win.. Because they gave us what if?!...", "As real as a donut": "Whenever I go to watch a Tarantino film, I know that something huge is coming. He is one of those filmmakers that made me love cinema and understand its value and force. I remember the first time I watched \"Kill Bill\". I was home sick, sitting in the coutch and I thought: \"Well, if the medicines can't make me fine, something has to!\". And eventually he did. \"Kill Bill\" fixed my mood and made me revalue art. It was creative, took risks and it was lots of fun. And now, Quentin makes his 9th film and boy, oh boy, isn't it a blast.\"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is one of Quentin's mosot intellligent, detailed and fun films to watch and also serves as insant love letter to film and to this crazy world called Hollwood, Let's dig into it.Firstly, the world. Right form the first 15 minutes of the film it is visible that Quentin has given life to the 69' Hollywood era. Everything feels so real and the whole film looks like it is set that exact time, even if I never lived there to see what it is liked. The funky streets, the pop-up graphittis, the clothing, the cafeterias and cinemas, the shiny billboards, the 69' cars and lastly the car radios that play constantly during the film and ads are included. Quentin used all of the tracks included in an old radio station \"Boss Radio\" and he actually remembers that during that time people would not switch from one radio station to the other, but keep it there for their whole drive, even if they disliked a song or the adverstisments started playing. That's a nice touch.\nAlso, Quentin created made-up films for the film and also reshot of these films with new actors. His team crafted posters, mugs and turned a whole street into 69' Hollywood. Now that demands your attention.OF course, there is no Tarantino film without Tarantino characters in it. And he manages to birng out one of the most dinamic and fun to watch duos in cinema history. We got famous actor Rick Dalton, known for his presense in westerns and other films and his stuntman Cliff Booth, who, as they both agree to, has the job of carrying his load. Rick is at the ends of his career, he has been playing the bad guy in TV series pilots for the past years and his good, shiny days are gone. He feels like a nobody and in his face we see a faiding star who desperately tries to shine again. Cliff, on the other hand, is more calm and controlled. He just finds driving Rick to his jobs and bein his buddy fun and does not really care that his career is ending. Their story takes place during the infamous Hollywood scandal of the Sharon Tate murders ( 9 of August, 1969) . We also get to see the life of Tate before these events, as she enjoys the goods and luxurys of being a pretty actress in the Hollywood world.As I see it, the whole film is centered around the friendly bond of Rick and Cliff, even if the story drags them to different paths. Their friendship is what gives soul to the film. Rick keeps trying to be a star again and Cliff is there to remind his that he is Rick-f-word-Dalton. In the two fo them we see a duality of man. We have the worrying actor who fears of his finishing career and the relaxed stuntman who has accepeted his situation and just keeps living. Put these two together and there you have it.The cast is tremendous. Margot nails non-verbal acting, escpecially at the cinema scene with her really authentic reactions, Leo is has not been more mad and Brat is just... priceless. His performance along with Cliff's easy-going personality and violent-nature all come together and create what might be one of Quentin's most memorable characters. Pacino has a nice role too and Curt Russel hating a stuntman is alreary a hit. Oh, and the Bruce Lee scene is the most funny scene I've seen in a while and those who claim that it is mean to portray him like that are just dump people with no sense of humour.Now, let's talk about the story's stucture because a lot of people call this film boring and claim that nothing is going on, but the poor ones just don't get it.\nTo beign with, there is a difference between slow-paced and boring. Yes, the movie has a slow pace, but it is not boring at all. To me, it's all about the characters and the world they live in. We get the chance to see and feel what Hollywood felt like during 69' and we actually get to see the life of two really ineresting personalities portrayed by brilliant actors. Yes, the film does not have a certain goal or a narrative whch goes from one point to the other, like Django or Reservoir Dogs. It is more of a collection of moments that come togeher and create such a fun watch. We get western scenes, hippie scenes, a lot of driving scenes... how isn't this fun? I can't say that I got bored in the film at any means.Maybe the Sharon Tate parts felt kind of less interesting compared to the other two stories, especially the first itme I watched the film, and at some points the film goes at weird directions, but it is all about the characters the portayal of the industry.Okay, the soundtrack is just pure gold. \"Hush\", \"Treat Her Right\", \"Son of a Loving Man\", \"California Dreamin'\", 'Out of Time\", Bring a Little Lovin'\"... one of Tarantino's best tracks and it makes the film much more energetic and atmospheric.The ending is really, really clever and it feels like a huge hug of consolation to Tate and to Hollywood's history from the one and only, Quentin Tarantino. By the end, I just wanted more and more...\"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is a cinematic joy. It is powerful, stylish, funny, comfy, clever, atmospheric, melancholic, beautiful and I feel that one day it will be considered of those film's that told history in the most fun and sweet of ways.See you in the next one, Quentie.", "OMG what did I just watch": "This is a lovely looking film with a decent storyline that overstays it's welcome by about 60 minutes. Every one of those minutes are felt and worse as they go on. It's an odd trick that kind of works to craft a story around real events and throw in representations of real people. This gives weight but also distorts. Ultimately it's a lingering tale of Hollywood which goes south in the middle, almost as though the director knows he has 3/4 of story left to tell but has already used up 1/2 the running time. It all goes wrong when we get a narrator, Kurt Russell I think, to tell us what is happening. Then the spell is well and truly broken and it's a mess that gets swept up to the end. I guess the rewriting of history using history is the fairytale part with the fairytale ending. With less filling and less time it could have been magic", "Amazing work again by Tarantino": "I absolutely loved this film. Tarantino's flawless cinematography brings this vibrant world and it's rich characters and their story to glorious life. The score is very well thought out fitting the time period perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors in Hollywood right now and Brad Pitt is the coolest man alive. What keeps it away from being 10/10 is the movie starts to drag slightly a bit towards the end of the second act. Nevertheless, there isn't a dull moment and the ending is my favourite of any film ever.", "Instant Classic": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood makes truly puts you in the shoes of a struggling actor in the golden age of Hollywood. It is also a heartfelt tale about friendship.", "This isnt a typical Comedy": "Leonardo kills it in this movie top to bottom what a performance. Brad is solid and delivers well in his scenes also kills it. Margot at times feels like a bit wallpaper but her sitting in the movie was so sweet and made me smile. The ultimate thing is the buildup is worth the wait this movie delivers in a hardcore fashion. It is almost like this is how the manson craziness would go down Tarantino style i loved it and yea people may not like this movie but it is brilliant. Tarantino has crafted a great comedy movie with some interesting subtexts ENJOY IT i cried from laughter at this movie.", "What a film !!!": "Honestly this film is like no other.... QT has smashed it again I'm a huge fan of his work I mean a few of his films have been slow we can all accept that but this film has me interested from the first scene...this film contains comedy, violence and even a bit of thriller this film had my hands sweating in some scenes it's like no QT film ever but it felt like a QT film...the music is what makes a Tarantino film and this had some great 60-70 tunes....honestly one of the best films I've seen in a long time", "One unrelated event after another.": "Big disappointment. Watched this hoping for another Tarrantino masterpiece, instead it was a slow boring unrelated scene by scene almost 3 hrs movie. I was desperate for something to happen along with the audience. Some people even walked out. Shocked at all the high reviews.", "WHAT A FILM": "Never seen a film like it. It manages to tell a story without telling one. The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Leonardo Di Caprio was phonemenal.

Amazing acting job, great story - gave me the pulp fiction vibe.", "Garbage movie": "I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, I love Kill Bill,Pulp Fiction,Inglorious bastards,Django...but this one was just long boring crap. I think he made this movie for him self. Nothing really happened in the movie and I cannot spoil it even if I want to.

All around just a great entertaining movie", "I thought Tarantino knew about movies?": "This movie is supposed to take place in 1969, yet Bruce Lee's hairstyle in the movie did not appear until 1972..

If Mr. Tarantino is going to make another movie, I will wait until it comes on Putlocker, am not wasting my money again.....conned.", "There wasn't a plot, but why did there need to be?": "Tarantino's new movie explored 3 sets of characters in an intermingled revisionist story that ultimately ended with a twist to how the Sharon Tate tragedy went. We enjoyed a film with deep character development told through flashbacks, interactions with fellow cast/crew members, and suspenseful moments that helped solidify the character's motives. The acting, cinematography, and sets gorgeously painted the picture in Tarantino's head for us to enjoy. In the same way that the Basterds kill Hitler, we're met with a twist that ultimately ends with Sharon Tate not dying, but instead an assault that plays out in the home of our protagonists, Rick and Cliff. It shares many concepts with that of Pulp Fiction, in that it's a nonlinear telling of a few stories that end in a climactic scene, but without a lot of the structure Pulp Fiction had to indicate what was happening or where we were. Ultimately, I think this decision added to the impending feeling of doom and unease that all the characters felt in their situations. It felt as if there was no plot because none of the characters were confident in where they were going to end up. We were just following the characters along for the ride, seeing what was going to happen to them as opposed to predicting where their stories would end. This movie is a different kind of masterpiece. It's unique and has bold storytelling choices, but I don't think it should be docked for being a different kind of story. An incredible feet for Quentin Tarantino, pun intended.", "Tarantino Asks \"What If?\"": "48 hrs since watching this movie. I've had a chance to digest the movie, acting, writing, visuals. 10/10. I loved it. Tarantino gets a chance to ask what if the dirty murderous hippies had gone into the next door neighbors house instead of the house Sharon Tate lived in.\nEnter the neighbors house where a real hombre lives and his driver (tough guy Brad Pitt) and his way too cool pit bull go on to kill and humiliate them. Maybe...just maybe a retreat of sorts would have taken place and the men and women of Hollywood would have been able to keep Hollywood real for a little while longer. Instead of they terrible stain the hippies left on Hollywood it would have just been a case of some home invaders were killed.", "WOW": "Best of the best. Because of this film I made my very first IMDb account, just so I can review it. I didn't know about a big part of the story until I read about it afterwards on Wikipedia and yet I was able to thoroughly enjoy this movie on every level enough to give it a 10/10. Imagine if I actually knew what story the movie was based on.The lighting and camera-work and acting and everything is just spot on. Tarantino is a contemporary artist with his choices and the excellency of those choices is magnified in multitudes by the amazing people that he has access to in Hollywood. All of the main actors acted their hearts out. An absolute 10/10.", "Unbearable tension": "Why are are people so bored and disappointed with this movie? Not enough blood or what? The period setting already had the undercurrent of horror.\nWhy does Cliff not leave the Manson commune? Surely he can tell bad things could happen. Is George Spahn going to be a shriveled corpse in a rocking chair? Then there's poor Rick, the 50's hack whose time is running out, but Shwarz throws him a lifeline and the precocious child actor throws him a bone.\nThe whole time you're wondering if we're going to have to endure the vile Tate/Manson horror show but QT slightly eases the tension with Cliff confrontation. If he can take on Bruce, maybe he can save himself and the Daltons, but will the psycho shoot him in the face first? There's no way to know if Quentin's going to go Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction.\nThe beautiful set dressing was so distracting I'll have to watch it at least once more to try and keep up with the actual script and visual clues and gems. .", "Quentin hits this one high up in the bleachers. . .": "Some sharp dialogue in this one.

The story is so interesting and QT & company really pull you into the era, you actually feel you are transported to LA-1969.

I even defending his last film, The Hateful Eight, as I thought it was weak, but still enjoyable.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was just a miss. The acting was good, attention to detail was phenomenal as I felt I was watching 1960's Hollywood. But there was almost no plot. It was just a couple guys driving around doing everyday things...for 3 hours!The last 15 mins of the film are excellent and almost redeem the prior bore fest.

It's a beautiful tribute to old Hollywood and Cinema. I think this is the best of all Tarantino's work since Inglorious Basterds. Leo and Brad had a great chemistry to each other. All of the cast even the minor characters are great. Margot Robbie really embodied Sharon Tate but Leo and Brad really takes the cake. The actor who played Charles Manson even if it's just a brief moment really blows me away that i thought he is Charles Manson, now that's a great acting.

QT has trivialized slavery, the Holocaust, and now, sensationalized murder.

Viewing this film this past August 2019 (in a luxury movie theater) was one of my birthday presents from my beloved. To say that I cherished this gift was an understatement! I am a devoted Brad Pitt, Quentin Tarantino and Leonardo DiCaprio fan ...so for the three of them to team up reminded me that we have greatness in our midst. Brad Pitt performed Cliff Booth with a purposeful clean and concise confidence and gravitas, providing us awe-inspiring work we have loved about Brad our entire lives. I appreciate his ability to exhibit his healthy physical form, that can only come from discipline and hard work, which may be the source of Brad's wellspring we all count on Brad to exude. Leo DiCaprio's complicated persona of Rick Dalton was executed with surgical precision, perhaps his most multifaceted, complicated monologue and emotional array we may have ever witnessed from Leo. I absolutely adored Quentin's creative force-to-be-reckoned-with writing and directing in this film. The action was riveting, strenuous, thrilling and provided heart palpitations with sheer raw physicality portrayed by Brad Pitt.

Not even close.This is a movie that QT seemed to create for himself.I liked the 60s references and a few of the scenes (here and there), but overall the movie is a disappointment. I like QT movies, so I was looking forward to this one. But it rambled on far too long and really didn't end up anywhere.The story could have been much better, especially for the very long run time. In fact, I feel it could have been better even with 45 minutes less screen time. This is the first QT movie that I was looking at my watch, hoping to leave the theater soon. I don't mind long movies...if they have a compelling plot. This movie was a mess.The story of the Manson Family Members and the Sharon Tate murder could have made an interesting script, especially in the hands of Tarantino. I'm confused as to why this fell on its face so hard.DiCaprio's character was so-so, but he played Rick Dalton well (with what he was given).Brad Pitt did well with his character (Cliff Booth) and was the more interesting than Dalton. Heck, Booth's dog was more interesting than most of the characters.I guess Robbie did well as Sharon Tate, but she didn't have a lot to do.Al Pacino did a good job as Marvin Schwarzs. I was dubious of the type of role he was going to have in the movie, but it worked well.It's not the worse movie that I saw this year, but don't expect it to be anywhere near the level of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, Jackie Brown, ...", "What was that": "Can't believe how poor this film is after all of the hype and how it can have a 7.7 rating is beyond me.It is well over an hour to long for the story and like watching paint dry.You are expecting something, anything to happen and it is simply boring.The acting by Brad Pitt is the only reason I did not give it a 1.Even the finale was so far fetched it was just an awful waste of nearly three hours.Give it a massive miss and watch something else", "Its tarantinoo": "Movie was amazing, little bit of american history but, its still fantastic, and at end its tarantinos job", "It's a great movie, but this is in NO WAY a masterpiece": "My actual Rating: 7.6/10I'm feeling so mixed about this movie. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie. However, there was just no plot to this movie. Absolutely none. It's just the everyday life of a struggling actor with no life altering events to give this movie a plot.However, I enjoyed everything else about this movie. I loved the dialogue and it's witty humor. Dicaprio gave an amazing performance (the first time I saw leo as a character rather than an actor playing a character). Pitt's character was my favorite. Margot Robbie definitely did a great job for what little substance her character had. She had 15 lines in the entire movie. I wish there was substance for her. Cinematography was good. Costumes were great in creating the nostalgia. The ending was my favorite part of the movie: true Quentin Tarantino fashion. Everything in this movie was good except for the story.Now you maybe asking why I gave this movie an 7.6 instead of 4 or 6 if I hated the story so much. Well, I was completely entranced by this movie. I was never bored when watching this in the theatre. However, after watching it, I came out of the theatre saying \"What did I just watch?\" and not in the best way. Not in a bad way, but not in like the best way. I didn't really know how to process this movie, yet i enjoyed myself when watching it. So i'm honestly just mixed about this movieAnother thing I'm confused about is why are people calling this a \"masterpiece\" or saying \"We don't deserve this film.\" These are probably the same people who think that the actually great movies of this decade which deserve to be classics are bad movies (sorry for that phrasing, I hope that makes sense). Anyways, in my eyes, this film is an enigma I need to crack because i feel like there's something i'm not getting. I will definitely be watching this again to see if there's something I'm missing.Now coming to the end of this confusing review, should you go this film? yes, I think you go see this film. You either will love this movie, or just be confused by it (just like me)", "Both fascinating and frustrating": "A faded actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) try to make it in 1969 Hollywood. Somehow Sharon Tate (Margot Robie) is mixed into all this. Charles Manson too.OK--in some ways this film is brilliant. Wonderful direction by Quentin Tarantino, great acting by the entire cast and 2/3rds of it is superb. However the first section is deadly dull with a LONG sequence showing DiCaprio acting in a 1969 TV western. I hate westerns and this did nothing to change my mind. It drones on endlessly and I was fighting to stay awake. After that it was fantastic. There's one sequence with Pitt at the Spahm Ranch which is downright chilling. It all ends with some VERY extreme blood and gore. Recommended with reservations.", "I'll keep it simple, unlike the movie": "This movie is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. In order to understand it, you need to know who Tarantino is and where he comes from.\nHe's a guy who loves cinema and has reached enough maturity to try and show us his passion.\nIf you don't get it, that's fine. Try and watch it again.\nBut if you give this 1/10 well... maybe cinema is not your thing.", "Smart, funny ode to film , stars, and Hollywood.": "Tarantino draws out the best of his two stars while subtly building to an unforgettable climax that provides a greag revision of one of Hollywood's greatest tradgedies.", "Best Third Act of any Tarantino film": "Going into this movie, audiences worldwide can come to an agreement that over the years, a sense of trust with Quentin Tarantino has been built, as he has never made a BAD movie, or even a 'meh' one. 'Once Upon aTime in Hollywood' confirms his role as one of the most influential directors in this industry. The set design is brilliant, the acting is oscar-worthy, the dialogue is clever, the screenplay is unique, the list can go on. But I think that this movie really shines in its third act, leaving all audiences with a sense of satisfaction. Some may argue that this ending is not worth the long-feeling second act, but for me it most definitely did. I think it really comes down to what type of movies you enjoy. Those who enter this movie thinking that they are in for a rollercoaster of gore and snappy Tarantino out of the blue moments may be disappointed, but those who adore his movies for the unforgettable dialogue are in for a ride. Also, the third act provides plenty of Tarantino moments for an ultimate time in the theater. For me, this is one of the best movies of the year.", "Plotless montage with genius ending": "The ending is genius.

But I have to admit, other than Pulp Fiction and (to a lesser extent) Reservoir Dogs, I have no interest in watching them again after the first viewing. He just seems to be trying to hard to entertain, create interesting dialogue, whatever... I can't put my finger on it, but it's there. They do not stick in the mind, other than stylistically.Until this picture. There are movies that somehow just scratch an itch in your mind. You want to go back to them. Need to. This movie really scratches that itch for me. There are so many elements that seemlessly come together to make this a true masterpiece of cinema. From the amazing soundtrack, one of the best of the year IMHO, to the fantastic pacing (one of the most under-rated and misunderstood characteristics of great movies), to the incredible acting.Let's talk about the actors. Brad Pitt and Leo Decaprio are truly at the top of their game here. Truly astounding acting. Pitt is the lens for the entire '60's vibe going on here. We see this slice of life through his eyes, and also see how he deals with it. A truly great character. And Leo, wow, one of his best movies as far as I'm concerned. I've been in the 'he's way over-rated' group of people regarding DeCaprio's talent. But he absolutely shines here as the actor in the downside of his career, knowing that, yet still trying for that great role.The supporting actors who deserve special mention are that group of dirty, f@*!king, smelly hippies who are central to this story. Tarantino really (and intentionally) takes the luster out of part of the '60's era. This group of people is not presented sympathetically, as so many other movies have done. It probably is a more realistic depiction (to some degree), which adds to the originality of this screenplay. One other truly outstanding performance is the little girl actress who bonds with Leo's character. She is a joy to watch. The chemistry between those two is fantastic.In conclusion. the best Tarantino pic since Pulp Fiction. I've watched it 3 times already, and encourage others to do the same. It wasn't until my third viewing until I noticed that my wide screen literally turns into a '60's old fashioned television set. I mean it is quite literal. It blew my mind.", "Its excellent pure cinema accompanied with great acting.": "Tarantino showing why he is the the 2000's father of cool", "Ambitious, Fascinating yet Bloated Tarantino Epic": "Quentin Tarantino is back with his ninth film, \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.\" I've long been looking forward to this film for its outstanding cast and unique subject matter (1960s Hollywood) for Tarantino to work with. I thought this film was good but not great. It's an extraordinarily ambitious film that manages to showcase Tarantino's unbelievable cinephilia in a unique way, but it also can feel a bit bloated and tonally ridiculous in a few places.First and foremost, the acting in the film is very strong. Both DiCaprio and Pitt are charismatic and potent in their roles, and have exceptional chemistry together. Unfortunately, however, much of the supporting cast is severely underused. The production design here is both meticulous and magnificent, as Tarantino's affinity for --and knowledge of--the era is fully showcased. Viewers genuinely feel transported to Hollywood in 1969 while watching the film. The script is thoughtful and engaging, although it lacks the wit or punchiness of some of the writing in Tarantino's best films (like \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\") The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, as is the uniqueness and cleverness of many of its popular culture references. However, the film does drag from time to time, and lacks a clear plot and consistent focus for the first two hours. It's a unique and highly entertaining amalgamation of late 60s film history that feels unlike anything else, but I feel that a more defined plot would have helped the film considerably. Even though, for example, \"The Hateful Eight\" was very long, it still had a generally defined plot. Furthermore, the film feels rather tonally uneven by its conclusion. (Note: I do not mention any specific plot details of the climax and ending, but discuss its tone and general vibe, so I have marked the review with a spoiler warning just to err on the side of caution.) The film's outlandish finale feels like the over-the-top stuff that Tarantino is typically known for. But unlike many of Tarantino's more \"over-the-top\" movies like \"Kill Bill\" or \"Django Unchained\" or his more \"slow-burn up to a boil\" movies like \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"The Hateful Eight,\" this tonal shift just comes out of nowhere. As a result, this probably ends up being the most tonally inconsistent Tarantino movie, which is bitterly ironic given that the tone up until its climax is composed and steady. Still, this is an entertaining reflection on the late 60s that manages to serve as a time capsule to an era that Tarantino loves. Recommended, but it's not one of his best films. 7/10", "ONCE UPON A TIME... IN THE MIND OF QUENTIN TARANTINO": "ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD B- (65)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a 2019 Comedy, Drama film, starring; Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie, directed by; Quentin Tarantino\n'A faded television actor and his stunt double strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry during the final years of Hollywood's Golden Age in 1969 Los Angeles.'\nTarantino has always been a director that's at the top of most audience's favourite directors, so obviously a new film in his career will be on a lot of Most-Anticipated lists. At first I was a bit shocked at the initial reactions being very mixed. I prefer to ignore reactions prior to viewing the project in question and that's what I did with this film.\nSo, let's see how it is...\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPOSITIVES!\nThe fact that the film touches on and explores Hollywood and filmmaking is entertaining to selective audiences. As someone that enjoys the behind-the-scenes of filmmaking, this was enjoyable. This is perhaps the funniest Quentin Tarantino movie with plenty of laughs to be had by all. A lot of it was physical humour, and there were practical effects in those limited number of scenes that were vastly sturdy. A film with both Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt is seriously stimulating and the two-share strong chemistry together whilst being solid respectively. I'll admit that Brad Pitt was the more enjoyable side of the two with the comedy, physical, and other attributes. There's also a lot of other talent in the cast that will have audiences in a state of surprise. The cinematography is great, and the overall film looks gorgeous along with some entertaining editing. The costumes and other forms of makeup were all good restorations of the certain period being adapted. And there's a lot of music to tap along to.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMIXED!\nThere is no denying that Quentin Tarantino has made some of the best films throughout his filmography, but this has the least Tarantino-esk atmosphere. This film had a very straightforward direction and what's so brilliant about Tarantino's vision is that it's always ahead of everyone else's. Although the recreation of the times and structures was fantastic and wonderful to observe, there seemed to be too much focus on those recreations rather than producing a significant story...\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNEGATIVES!\nThe story? There were components to manufacture an entertaining narrative set in a \"Golden Age\" of Hollywood, but they never assembled. The film was more about glorifying Hollywood, which is something that Tarantino is fascinated by, but that doesn't mean that respective audiences would be as attracted. Sharon Tate's (Margot Robbie) appearance in the film and the way the character is written in the script is very empty. She's only in the film to allude to the tragic events that occurred in her life. And these elements really effect the enjoyment of the project. If you were expecting a clever and unique story then I apologise.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the end, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is an awfully varied project in my eyes, like most critics. Whilst I enjoy the performances, comedy elements, and just the period being adapted, Tarantino made a film for HIS enjoyment and not so much yours. I'm not persecuting the director, he's phenomenal, but this could be towards the bottom of my ranking for his career.", "Tarantino Firing On All Cylinders, But Mainstream Audiences Will Stay Away": "My Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood review at imdb.com\nOnce Upon A Time ... in Hollywood well be QT's magnum opus, to date anyway.

Likely his best performance on film, even if threads of late 1960s Jack Nicholson glimmer just below the surfaceDoubtless benefitting from both the advantages of experience and chronological age (he's just old enough to remember Woodstock, Altamont, perhaps even contemporaneous TV news stories of the Manson murders that signaled the tail end of the 60s), Pitt comes out on top and wins the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award going awayLong-legged Sarah Qualley is delightful and merits special mention as the mercurial, manic hippie chick and Manson disciple, PussycatFor those familiar with the actual, brutal and evil events of August 9 1969, Margot Robbie presents as an indistinguishable, breath-taking and alas, heart-breaking 21st century Sharon Tate.

I'm usually not entranced by his work, but the slow burn love letter to Hollywood leading up to what I've come to expect from him made me enjoy \"classic Tarantino\" far more then I otherwise would as well as leading me to want to rewatch his work with a newfound love. There wasn't a moment I found tedious while watching it, something I can't say for some of his others. I will say this is potentially due to my love of late 60s-70s aesthetics, making the cinematography that much more enchanting to me. As well as that, the acting is incredible and casting Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate is perfect. Overall, this film is amazing and definitely worth watching!", "pointless": "What was the point of this movie. The movie really didn't go anywhere narratively speaking.

Jeesh it kinda sucks to be truly honest. Decaprio is gold as always and Pitt does a fairly meh job of supporting but you can't carry a movie on just the acting.

I'm 59 and appreciated the nostalgia throughout. But the palpable tension from the back story that built in my gut surprised me. I almost turned it off knowing what was coming. Outstanding movie. Best I've seen in years. The music, as in other Tarantino (and Coen Bros.) flicks is surprising, apt, perfect (the JRB Theme made me laugh out loud). Lastly, as a male barely three years older than Brad Pitt, when he climbed up on that roof and took his shirt off I almost swooned. It would be easy to hate him if he wasn't so likeable.", "Hilarious, endearing, and we'll worth the watch.": "Is it a perfect movie? No! This movie has some flaws, it may move slowly at times, and the narration portion was a little bit clunky, but overall it really delivered. This is easily Tarantino's funniest movie, and I would argue Brad Pitt's finest performances as an actor. if you are going into this movie expecting non-stop action then you are going to be disappointed, but if you're okay with a slow burn with great dialogue then you can't help but love once upon a time in Hollywood. The ending is insane but I'll leave it at that as I wouldn't want to spoil it.", "Either the Worst or the Best Film...": "Before watching this film, it is CRITICAL that you have somewhat of a knowledge about Charles Manson (and Sharron Tate). If I did not have my sister next to me pointing out the small references to this serial killer's story, I would not have understood at least 80% of the movie. Understanding the significant details adds a specific intensity in every other scene, like you know something that the characters don't, and always keeps your eyes glued to the screen.Although I can see how a few scenes were fairly slow, and the middle was not particularly engaging, Tarantino definitely had a purpose for each scene, even if I don't have all the answers. Even the smallest of details, like a gun holster of beer or the way the characters drive down the highway, reveals hidden thoughts, feelings, and backstories to the audience. If you do not catch onto these specific details, I can understand how some points seem overindulgent of \"the golden age\" of Hollywood. But the beautifully nostalgic filming in these moments is what makes this film not only entertaining, but a piece of art.It's the juxtaposition of Sharron and Dalton's storyline, it's the wonder and the dimensional characters, it's the brilliant manipulation of the audience's emotions, causing you to laugh, scream, and cry (sometimes simultaneously) that makes this film utterly perfect.The ending leaves you wondering \"What if...\" over and over again, questioning what reality would look like if these fictional characters of Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth actually existed. And I think that's when I realized how perfect the title was: it's a humorous, fairy-tale (although not completely violent-free) ending to the tragic fate of Hollywood in the 60s...", "Typical Tarantino rubbish": "I wish I had know that this was a Tarantino movie before enduring 2+ hours of simply mind numbing, boring nothingness followed by typical Tarantino mindless violence.In usual Tarantino fashion it is like a movie of two schitzophrenic halves that seem to have no relevance to each other.I fail to see how this movie gets so many rave reviews, it's frankly awful.Some great filming with loads of retro cars and some good acting fails to make this an interesting movie....\nHollywood is so obviously way past it's best as this movie shows.....\nIf this was written by anybody else it would've been left where it should've been left, in the garbage bin!I am just grateful that it didn't cost anything to see as paying to see it would've been even worse!!!", "Wow. What an ending.": "Without giving too much away - the ending is, in a word, satisfying. VERY satisfying.\nPitt does a great job, through out. Impressive. DiCaprio too, is likable - and I am no fan of his.\nIt is a bit slow in places. I did catch myself checking my watch. NOT a good sign - but do yourself a favor and stay until the end. Though graphically violent, like Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, it works. If you know anything about the Manson murders. Yes, see it to the end.

Brad - fit the role perfectly. Margot - ray of sunshine. Tarantino - on point.": "Let's start with - what do you expect from Tarantino? The answer is simple - unexpected! And it's true, he always was and still is the king of the unexpected. His mind is so genius, and always left me stunned. I adore people who succeed to articulate and canalize the madness that they have into something so meaningful and good. Fans of Tarantino probably know thru his interviews how much he is passionate about movies and the way he talks about them is so infectious. He really knows how to put all that love into visual magic and deliver every time something special.As for the Once upon a time... in Hollywood, he really did put together all his previous movies into this one. It's a perfect mix, I would say. The cast can't get any better. Every role suits each actor perfectly. Leo surprises me, to be honest. He really is elite actor. For this one he really deserves an Oscar. I respected him from before, but now I get it. He put everything that he has in this role. Brad also, his character is so funny and chill, embodiment of casualness and nonchalance, and because of that Cliff Booth became one of my favorite character ever. And Margot Robbie truly is a ray of sunshine as Sharon Tate.Yeah, the first two hours of the movie are slow, but it is dramatic and beautifully shot, with perfect dialogue. And then in the last 45 minutes you get everything you want from Tarantino. His signature sigh as I call \"blood to the knees\" is there, the humor in this morbid and scary situations and scenes, and of course the ending is never as such as you expected to be, always even better. And also, this movie is full of references which only someone who knows Tarantino's work will understand how to read them and what they means in the context of the story.So, this movie isn't for everyone, and will not be liked by everyone, but truly is the work of art.", "Went to see a western and that's what I got": "There are a few times when you have high expectations for a movie and you come out satisfied. This was definitely one of them. I can't really say whether this is a good or bad movie but I know for sure that I enjoyed every second and I think that's the beauty of it, pure entertainment. When the movie was over I didn't realize it had already been running for 3 hours. Don't get me wrong this is not a western in the normal sense but a smart and highly sophisticated take on the life on Hollywood. There's a thin line between nonsense and perfection. I guess only a few people could have pulled that off, Tarantino being one of them. Incredible cast, great script and amazing directing. A must see!", "Nothing Is IN Here - Empty Can": "I must say I have never been Quentin Tarantino's admirer, and within the years this idea has only grown stronger. His movies are bland, blatant, cruel, empty flicks with no sense, essence or taste. Lack of everything ruins his films - lack of self-control, lack of dynamics, lack od ideas, lack of continuity, lack of good taste and above all, lack of cleverness.\nTHis movie is all that - long, painfully prolonged, shallow, bland, blunt, empty, silly, boring, insipid, languid, untasty, cold, vapid, exhausting array of senseless scenes and with total lack of cohesion on top.\nDiCaprio? Pitt? Robbie? Russel? Nay, they all seem leaden and puffed-up beyond belief. Qualley is stunningly beautiful, but she overplays so badly, it smacks of real low taste.\nPlot? Forget it. Music? Nice, but nothing thrilling. Moral? None, whatsoever.\nThe worst film of 2019 for sure. Typical QT's bunch of baloney.", "Interesting concept not fully actualized...": "To continue the caption \"...because of DiCaprio's painfully awkward and unconvincing portrayal of a Hollywood wannabe action star.\" I absolutely loathed his performance and if not for Brad Pitt and the luminous Margot Robbie, I found this movie unbearable to watch whenever DiCaprio was in the scene. However, the concept of rewriting history regarding that tragic and violent August 9, 1969 event was so promising. In addition, the cast boasted a multitude of talented actors so I was expecting much more from this movie. Unfortunately, I've never been a fan of Tarantino either and feel his talent is monumentally overrated. And one additional complaint - Damian Lewis looked NOTHING like Steve McQueen and his hairstyle was ridiculous! 3 stars for Pitt, Robbie and the compelling concept of reversing the tragic events in that tumultuous Summer of 1969.", "Perfect acting": "Our lives shouldn't be subjected to this 7am-11pm strings.

Led Zeppelin songs might help.", "1969 with a better ending, self defense classes & a flame thrower": "I loved, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" primarily for the ending of the movie, wishful thinking, if only the ending could have been true.But it wasn't, and because of the true life ending, I love how Quentin Tarantino created a magical, happy ending story.My 1969, was high school in Southern California, so I knew and recognized everything in this movie. I knew about the Manson Family - one of the judge's at the trial was the father of a student at a local high school.But I can appreciate someone being lost in the storyline and wondering, what is going on? No explanation of historical events were given and I actually felt bad for the audience that did doze off.Still, this is one of my all time favorite movies. I wish for those who were lost in the movie, a voice over once in a while, explaining what was going on historically would have been introduced, but it wasn't. This is a first rate, excellent movie I will love forever.", "Pretentious Crap - despite a great cast, good acting, photography & sound": "Save yourself a wasted evening and only turn up at the big screen for the last forty minutes. A completely pointless film full of set pieces about nothing, no story worthy of comment so even a great cast, good acting, soundtrack and cinematography can't lift this beyond a stinker rating. I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to help save other people's money , and I normally like most QT stuff. He's lost the plot like many a big name before him.", "I'm the heavy": "Once again...but with feeling, blood and of course feet. Tarantino lets lift to create the late 1960s of Los Angeles like only he can, and it works on many levels. Remember stunt man Mike? Well this time it's stunt man Brad. Brad Pitt coming into his own in a movie where it would be unfair to call him anything other than Cliff Booth. The stand out performance in a movie with so many. At a time where everything is changing Rick Dalton played exquisitely captivating by Leonardo DiCaprio is a faded television actor trying to keep himself relevant. Cliff Booth is his stunt double and chauffeur and of course we have Sharon Tate played by the oh so relevant Margot Robbie. Part fiction, part based on truth all these characters stories intertwined in a intense finale only worthy of a Tarantino film. What's interesting is how parts of the film is Rick Dalton acting out his scenes or Sharon Tate even watching her own film in a cinema. Watching someone work, these things would normally be seen as boring to some, but this is no normal director. Tarantino shoots the movie in a way where the minor delicate things matter. Traveling to work...he shoots Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth TRAVELING TO WORK!!! Yet somehow we the audience feel like we are part of their journey in the back seat of the Cadillac. No 3D, no special cgi effect, yet I am compelled to be on the tv set with Rick Dalton,Cliff Booth and yes even Bruce Lee. Just as compelled am I to be in the cinema watching Sharon Tate movies. I wasn't around for the sixties, and I certainly wasn't in Hollywood. Yet now it seems captured to a tee. I didn't know the real story and although this is fiction too I now am interested to find out more. Not only is this a depiction of hollywood and hippies, poor Hollywood vs rich but has some great guest stars like Kurt Russel and my all time favourite Al Pacino. The typical poignant never good enough Hollywood actor must convince himself when enough is enough. The content friend in Cliff Booth and the living life happy go lucky actress Sharon Tate. From cinema drive throughs to playboy mansions and the Manson's lair at the Spahn movie ranch where bounty law was shot, this atmospheric depiction into the life of Rick Dalton is as heartwarmingly fun as it is gore. From sixties style radio playing in the Cadillac to old adverts of his show nothing is more of a homage to that lifetime and nobody is gonna tell Rick Dalton goodnight!!!", "I'm not officially on the \"Tarantino Bandwagon\" but...": "...If you follow anything involving the Sharon Tate/Manson Massacre, this movie will hit you hard. There's no disputing Tarantino is brilliant. I've seen all of his movies, and only didn't care for one: 'Jackie Brown'.\nI will see his movies, but since 'Jackie Brown', I'm always hesitant about what to expect. I'm a huge fan of true crime so this was a no-brainer for me and couldn't wait to see what Tarantino would do with it. To my surprise I was crying at the end! What an emotional roller coaster he took me on! Tarantino honestly doesn't disappoint within this film. Absolutely brilliantly written! Brilliantly casted! Acted! Etc. you get the idea. I will no longer hesitate to his films. He's truly an ingenious in his field. Oh my! See this movie!", "Not very great": "Tarantino wants to end his carrier as a director..I can't agree more! I am sure most of people will get mad of be because of this statesment, but truth is that this movie is far from what I expected from the director of pulpfiction..the way Tarantino depicts Bruce lee is insulting and I am sure is couple of months the score of this movie will be below 7.5", "As usual, another masterpiece from the terrific Quentin Tarantino , Not for everyone": "This film is not pulp fiction nor django unchained, it was a gift to hollywood , he was expressing how much he loved hollywood , The acting , the cinematography and the writing it was all great ! The only negative thing in the film is some of the scenes can be shorted and that's all , Thanks Tarantino", "Cinematic art": "I cant put this 10 out 10 movie into words. But a few words of description would be that this films incaptulates the style and authenticity of 1969 hollywood. The characters played by brad pit and leo DiCaprio are so well written that I believe both will receive Oscar nominations. It is a long film, not to lie about that. But in contrast it is a fun pact 2 and a half hour film of an authentic hollywood portrayed through a purely cinematic masterpiece. I loved the music, and this films makes me love the 60s also.", "Watch this in theaters!": "This is a movie you cannot miss in theaters. This is an event film on the scales of the best comic book movies, BUT, its a hang out film with Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio. I don't know if that makes sense lol, but its really how I feel. Will this movie feel long for some? Sure. But I'm telling you it's worth it for how funny it is, how amazing the spectacle is, and how great the acting is.", "Tarantino's poetic story about life in Hollywood!": "Like many others, I was somewhat thrown off with the pace of the film. However, the characters...the characters and the little situations they went through were hilarious and very engaging. I don't understand why the kids are upset! Whining about no plot and criticizing the film went nowhere. It seems like this latest generation of cinema lovers can only find entertainment in a movie being constantly fed countless fighting sequences and explosions and whatnot. The movie was comedy, and a DAMN good one! The Tarantino suspense was there, the Tarantino violence was there, Tarantino dialogue was everywhere. The music was great and made me feel ironically nostalgic even though I only grew up in the 90s. The set looked fantastic. Margot Robbie was a ray of sunshine in the movie and I believe she portrayed Sharon Tate beautifully. The innocence of her character and her joyous presence really developed throughout the movie. The more I watched, the more I understood the characters! So many little easter eggs were thrown in that I'm sure 60s folk Tarantino fanbase would love. The film sort of did have a plot, while also charmingly shying away from the plot by ingeniously dissecting movie and tv sets. It is so much like Pulp Fiction without chapters. Pulp Fiction had no plot and was praised, praised because of the characters. I have no doubt that if Pulp Fiction were to come out today rather than in '94, it would be receiving the same backlash as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. With that said, I've watched the movie 2 times in theaters with different friends and going again in a couple days with a couple of other friends! So far most of them have enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll enjoy it even more the third time. There's so much material in the movie, it's like studying through a textbook!", "So boring this put me to sleep": "I dont get how anyone call this movie great, a movie is meant to entertain and this one does not or Did Not! I got bored and fell asleep for around 20 mins and dont think I missed much when I woke up.\nAvoid it like the plague", "C'era una volta il Tarantinoland": "\"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is an American movie from 2019, so still really fresh and new and this is without a doubt gonna be a big player this awards season. The reason is of course that the man in charge here of script and direction was a certain Quentin Tarantino. There are some parallels and some differences compared to his other recent films. First of all the movie takes us again back in time, but this time not as far as the days of slavery and also not even as far as the days of WWII, but \"only\" into the year 1969. Like with other (recent) films from him, it is really long, clocks in at over 2.5 hours, but also as with other films from him, it does not feel this long because of how good it is. Looking at the cast, you will find familiar names you have seen in Tarantino films not too long ago. DiCaprio was a key supporting player in his previous work, Brad Pitt was in the one before that. If you pay close enough attention, you will also see brief appearances by Tarantino regulars Russell, Madsen and Bell. Tim Roth also shot scenes, but they were deleted sadly. Still you can see Tarantino is a loyal filmmaker when it comes to who he casts, not Fassbinder level maybe, but still. But there are also other actors in here who (I think) have not been in Q's works before. This includes the great Al Pacino and Bruce Dern who I like as well and who has one scene only in here. I also liked to see Timothy Olyphant in here as I really adored him on Justified and it's kinda fitting he plays in here in a year when a Deadwood movie was made and became quite a success. Also he's on Fargo now, so his career is going strong. Dakota Fanning many will recognize here, but she did not do too much for me. I have always been more of an Elle Fan(ning).Who else? Oh yeah Luke Perry who sadly died not too long ago has also one scene here together with DiCaprio. Emile Hirsch was okay. Damien Lewis, well I have never been a big Homeland fan admittedly, even when he was on it, but his one-scene turn as Steve McQueen was pretty hilarious how they talk about Sharon Tate's taste in men. And there we have the name of the central female character already, namely the one played by recent Oscar nominee Margot Robbie, certainly one of the hottest actresses on the planet right now, well I mean in terms of how much people are interested in their talent, not only in their looks, even if I as somebody with a preference in dark-haired girls cannot call her unattractive either. She is stunning. And while I was not really won over by her acting talent after Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, her role selections as Harley Quinn, Tonya Harding and now Sharon Tate were not only daring, but also she really made a lot with these characters honestly and she was memorable in this film here too, which was admittedly impressive because she had far from the baity material Pitt and DiCaprio did. Maybe the reason was that she rarely had to share the screen with others or at least not with others who really took the spotlight away from her and with that also I mean Polanski, who wasn't present anyway in the key scene at the theater (that was all hers) and also at the end of course.So you already saw I mentioned several scenes that really made an impact, but even if the overall outcome and congruent story line was certainly not bad, it was not nearly as great as the individual scenes, but then again that is really something that applies to almost every Tarantino film. I will mention another handful of scenes that stay(ed) in the mind. The one I think of immediately is the one with the child actress, the little girl who plays the character that DiCaprio's character in character holds hostage. This hostage scene with how amazed she is by him and his performance and improvisation is also pretty good, but not nearly half as good as their first meeting that is about the books they read, especially about the book Rick (LDC) reads and in which the main character stands for DiCaprio's character himself. I mean Leo was good there too, but the girl was a true scene stealer. The name is Julia Butters and I am truly curious about what we will see from her in decades to come. I hope she stays in the industry and of course stays as great as she was here. Then also the flame thrower scene. That was also pretty funny earlier when Rick Dalton asks if they can turn the temperature a bit down and the guy working there says something like \"Rick, it is a flame thrower\", but again of course when Tarantino picks up on this gadget near the end with one of the intruders being at the wrong end of it. It's pretty hilarious and epic when Leo comes out with it in his hands and I laughed a lot.Now I mentioned Leo a lot, but the one who deserves at least as much praise here is Brad Pitt who finally seems to have managed to cut himself loose from the ugly aftermath of his marriage to Angelina Jolie and has two promising films and performances coming out here. So Pitt had many memorable scenes too and he gives it the right approach without a doubt. I am talking about the moment he pushes Bruce Lee into an expensive car, the scenes with the hot young girl (now I am not sure I could have resisted her) and what followed in what looked like outback when he goes to visit Dern's character. There it was a typical scene when you expected some escalation or anything because of how tense the atmosphere was, but it stayed all relatively harmless surprisingly except the tyre changing perhaps at the end. And with Pitt you also have to mention the scenes at the house of course with his dog. I mean nobody can make a starving dog seem as entertaining as Tarantino that much is safe. The dog wasn't even cute and still I could not look away. As for the end, it is really violent, but this is also Tarantino and if that keeps you from watching the entire film, then that's your loss. Like, REALLY violent with what happens to two of the three intruders. I won't go into detail, but lets just say the dog is not a chihuahua and Pitt's character basically the canine's human equivalent. Last two movies it was the racists and the Nazis (well they are racists too aren't they?) who really got punished hard, this time it is the satanists.Okay what else can I say here. I mean Tarantino is a big film junkie and film fan everybody knows, so no surprise you can literally see on the screen how much fun he had making a film about the movies here (even if in the broadest sense Basterds was that too, but not to such an extent). As a consequence, it is packed with interesting and captivating references about the world of movies, not just about Polanski and Rosemary's Baby, but a lot different stuff too. And Tarantino used many fun songs for this one too. Not the film's greatest strength, but only because other aspects were better. As for the ending, you never knew where this was heading. Obviously he would not give us an authentic retelling of the events that night when super-pregnant Sharon Tate was killed in cold blood by Manson's helpers, but instead his own take, his fictitious take on things. This alone should be obvious already by the use of Dalton and Cliff Booth (Pitt) who I believe are completely fictitious characters, so no surprise that the ending also had nothing to do with how things went that night. I usually hate unrealistic fake endings for the only purpose to have audiences leave the theater with a smile, but this is totally not it here. It was a great choice and execution as we see Rick enter Tate's house to play cards or so with the gang. Actually what he dreamt of as he mentioned earlier to be included in her and Polanski's circle of friends. As for Leo, the film also could have ended already for all I care the moment when he is totally moved by the compliment from the young actress as he did not add too much later on again, well except the flame thrower scene of course. That alone was worth it to continue his story line in the pool.Okay now, I started my review to talk about awards attention and I will finish it like that too. I am not sure if this film will give Tarantino another screenplay Oscar, but a nomination seems really safe and a win also possible. Some even list him first for Best Director at the Academy Awards, but even if i thought this was mostly a great watch I am not sure this should be the film that gets him his first director Oscar. It is not his best work, maybe not even Top3, but good to see him this strong again in his mid 50s and if it takes like five years between his movies always, then I am really looking forward to his next effort already when he will be like 60. Maybe Kill Bill 3? Come on Quentin, we've been waiting for it so long. Anyway, as for the awards, Brad Pitt is considered a frontrunner for the Supporting Actor Oscar right now at this admittedly really early stage, but I am also a bit skeptical here. I mean he was good and all, but is it a performance that really stands out in his career compared to other stuff he did? I don't know. But it would not be entirely undeserving I guess. Same with Robbie who had a more difficult challenge here than it seems to the untrained eye I think. As for the film's Best Picture chances, I will wait with a final verdict there. It is in my top3 right now from 2019 with the other two having no chance to win Best Picture, but lets see what I think about the other nominees, such as Scorsese's new film of course. Okay back to Hollywood now, very fitting that Tarantino claimed this film title after OUATI the West and OUATI New York and he sure is deserving and what he did with this movie is more than just repectable. So overall, a big thumbs-up. Do I even have to say this one gets a bold positive recommendation from me? It's Q after all. Watch. Highly recommended.", "Keeping it simple": "Long, boring, pointless wasted 3 hrs of my life.

This movie is not about the story, but about the atmosphere. And boy, it is good. The colors, the costumes, the beautifully shot scenes, the glamour, the lights. It's slow burning because you need time to enjoy the ride. It makes you feel like you're inside the movie, absorbing Hollywood in its purest state. The cast is amazing, Leonardo Dicaprio never disappoints, and I don't remember ever seeing him in a role as funny as this one. Brad Pitt is just as good, even though I wish we learnt more about his character's past. Margot Robbie is delightful. All of the Manson Girls were fabulous delivering a creepy yet seductive feel.

Not the worst either.": "The biggest difference between Tarantinos earlier movies, as opposed to his most recent(Hateful 8 & Once upon a time...) is in his earlier films, you are immediately pulled into the story. You are immersed in the characters' personality and you hang on to every word they say, because everything they said was interesting or part of the story, or both!His more recent films have little to none if that. Although they are great movies, they no longer follow an incohesive story where you are always eager to know what happens next. Hateful 8 and Once upon a time spend too much time building the world the characters are in, and get lost along the way. The stories take too long to reveal themselves, and the action is few and far between.Tarantino did make another good film, but sadly they are nothing like his first few, and very subpar to Kill Bill, one of his best films. He needs to go back to solid action and crime with amazing dialogue. That was always his greatest strengths, and its sadly not here.", "One of the best film of the year!!!!!": "This is one of my favorite films . A great acting , cinematography and set decoration.", "Worst movie ever": "Don't even waste ur time on this. A movie with a star studded line up and dry pointless plot.", "It was ok": "The only reason I gave it as good of a review as I did is because I grew up in Los Angeles and was familiar with the history. Otherwise it's somewhat forgettable.", "A mere vehicle for gore": "Previous excessively gruesome movies seemed to have a point. Not that the inclusion of gratuitous violence refined those points.This one seems pointless.", "Absolutely rubbish. Worst thing I've seen in years.": "If you're going to see this all I can recommend is that you watch it mid afternoon so you can take a nap through the first 2 hours and only watch the mildly exciting final 15 odd minutes. I've never seen so many storylines in one film mean absolutely nothing in regards to the overall film.", "A love letter to lost innocence": "The sixties came to a crashing end with the Manson family murders, and Tarantino's tour de force laments that end with pathos and imagination. His best film since Pulp Fiction 25 years ago, it builds slowly through languid character-building scenes to the shocking conclusion. John Wick it ain't, and if you have the attention span of a gnat you won't like this film. I can't imagine any cinephile not loving it.", "Recommended for those who love a good period piece": "In Quentin Tarantino's newest film, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a film set in 1960s Los Angeles in an alternate timeline. Where an aging television actor and his stunt double/longtime friend embark on an odyssey to make a name for themselves in the Hollywood film industry.So Tarantino is a fantastic director, most of us film buffs know this. He's just so masterful at what he does, so I'm a huge fan of his. I knew this movie would at least be well-shot and probably well-written, both of which are true. But, don't go in expecting an \"average constructed film\". This is a film that doesn't really have a structured plot, you're kind of just following characters along in their daily lives. So if that's not for you, then this movie won't be your cup of tea.Right off the bat, the opening is great. It really begins to show us Tarantino's love for film and its creation. The movie is a huge peek behind the curtain which I love and a tribute to Hollywood's golden age. Though I found myself longing for even more of this. Show us even more cameramen doing their thing, stage lighting, practical special effects, filmstrips, etc. This didn't take from the movie itself, it's just my own personal desire to see.So I figured out that this movie specifically is bringing it back to older western movies/television. Immediately I thought of my dad and watching \"Bonanza\" with him as a kid. Very accurate portrayal of this genre. I mean one of the first shots in this film is in a bar. We see Leonardo Dicaprio's character Rick and Brad Pitt's character Cliff chatting and drinking. Get that nasty celery stalk drink out of my face Cliff! I do however want all of the Leo dancing scenes though.There's many random close-up shots on various items/props throughout the movie. These do come into play later on, but I was so confused for awhile. The film is pretty lengthy too at about 2 hours and 45 minutes, so it slows down the pacing significantly during parts. One that this sticks out the most is when were introduced to Cliff's trailer. We literally see dog cans being opened, microwaving food and a few other things that just dragged on for too long. So random question. How old is Brad Pitt? I looked it up after the movie and it says he's 55. Wow he looks good on that roof shirtless for 55!Though we get 2 main interesting fictional characters, they are surrounded in this movie by non-fictional characters being portrayed. People like Bruce Lee, whom was perfection and Sharon Tate. I was disappointed to see that Margot Robbie as Tate had very little acting wise to do in this film. Which is a shame! Bringing life back to Sharon Tate could've been such a great dedication to her. Especially after it's been so long. Basically throughout the film its 3 stories intertwining together in 2 days I believe until the 6 month time jump.Continuing with Sharon Tate. I wasn't sure if they'd touch on the Tate, Sebring, Wojciech, Frykowski and Folger murders since they were so gruesome. Though I had a feeling they were heading towards that route once I called the hippie cult stuff as soon as I saw the \"ranch\". It didn't fully click to me until a little later in the film that it's Manson's ranch and the hitchhiker wanting Cliff to meet \"Charlie\". But once the time jump happened and the narrator starts describing in vivid detail the times and places these characters are going I knew it was time. Though granted not in the way I expected at all! Wow was that brutal and a true Hollywood movie ending! Tarantino builds us up throughout the film to basically rewrite history and take liberties in a way where I wish it had actually been the true ending to the very real life story. Seeing Charlie Manson portrayed in this made my heart stop.On the opposite end of the spectrum, the humor in this lands hard. I was cracking up during many parts of this movie man! There's a credit scene with a cigarette ad that was incredible. The entire movie Rick is coughing up a damn lung and we get this! So good. Also I wanted to mention a scene I personally really loved which was the book discussion between Rick and the little girl (sorry I didn't catch the characters name). What a smart way to show character development/growth. We get to see a heartfelt compliment on acting as well to boost Rick's confidence and it's done really really well.If you're a Tarantino fan, you'll most likely enjoy this film. Don't expect an insane amount of action, it's more of an orchestrated period piece surrounding daily lives of actors. I enjoyed it thoroughly and will definitely be showing it to my parents since they will be able to appreciate aspects of it more than I personally ever could. But again, I love film so it's also my type of movie. I also wanted to say RIP Luke Perry, this was his last film before he passed away so he will be missed.", "A Movie to make you think... you won't get it if you can't.": "Tarantino surprises in this film. You expect the similar blood, gore and violence but it's a witty delve into 'actors' behind the glamour. They are normal, have insecurities, a stutter (maybe that's why Rick Dalton became an actor?) the reflection and acknowledgement life is good, and life is passing. It shows the end journey of the ageing Hollywood life, the decadence and lots of smoking!\nCliff's acceptance of his own failings, leering at the young girl yet his unpredictable response. His care for an old friend. Everything is mixed up.\nSharon. I love the owning of the reality v screen - you know the Tate story & learn about some of the others who are always listed as the 'other dead people.'\nThis movie isn't typical Hollywood at all. Like all his movies, you need to think a lot harder to join the threads, and that's the best part of the movie. It's not feeding you every single line treating you like a twit.\nSee it twice, see it and buy it. You'll get something different out of each time.", "A long movie with no plot": "My review contains a spoiler at end.I'm a big Tarantino fan and was really looking forward to this, but sorely disappointed with it.I kept waiting for a bit of action to occur or a story to develop, neither of which happened, except for maybe 10 minutes in the entire film.I thought The Hateful Eight was his worst film, but this steals that crown easily. I watched The Hateful Eight, and liked it more on a second viewing at home. I will never watch Once Upon... ever again.Tarantino is a genius in film making, but no one is perfect and there's always a dud or few in anyone's career.I don't know how this got 7.7 score, at the time I submitted my review, as expected a 3 point something average.I've left my spoilers to now, so don't read on if you don't want to know about the scenes I liked, the action referred to earlier. The Bruce Lee scene was funny and the final 12 minutes had some brutal violence, which I do like in his movies, and there's often plenty of it in his films, but not here.If you're a big fan like me, then you're going to want to watch it, and then force yourself to endure it to the bitter end. Enjoy it, if you can!", "Visual Timetravel": "A few days ago I experienced this movie in the theatre. The more I think about it, and discuss it with others who have seen it, I am convinced that this is a masterpiece. Better than Pulp Fiction. Better than Inglorious Bastards. The detail in Once Upon A Time is amazing, the devil is definitely in there. Never have I witnessed such elaborate depth in cinematography, sets, props and background noise and extras. This film transports you visually back to Cali in the 60s. If you want a movie with nonsensical action and a forced storyline, this is not for you. This reminds me more of a Jarmusch flick than anything else, slow and thoughtful, poetic and immersive. And that acting from DiCaprio is hauntingly beautiful, in my opinion he is becoming the best actor of this generation, he hasn't missed a beat since Shutter Island, to the best of my recollection.", "Spectacular": "This guy can just take a story, rewrite it ok his own way, and create a beautiful work of art, the images are beautiful, the colors, the characters, the actors who play actors, the dialogues. Everything ok this movie is perfect.", "Not your ordinary Taratino film.": "I came in expecting a Taratino film but it felt more like a soap opera. It doesnt have much of a plot, more like just seeing clips of their life. There's interesting parts with fantastic action but it just seemed pretty stale the 1st half of the movie. The 2nd half is where the plot begins and the climax of the film was a classic Taratino film.I enjoyed the film but it definitely can be boring for the 1st half of the film. I give it a 7 because I dont believe this is a +9 rating film. Definitely not better than Taratino's Pulp Fiction.", "Self Indulgent Rubbish": "I always thought Tarrantino could do no wrong but he really misses the mark with this movie. 3 hours of plotless self indulgence which would have been nontheless informative had it been only 30 minutes long. The whole film is only saved by fantastic performances from the lead actors and the closing 15 minute sequence. Disappointing Quentin.", "Satisfying and Delicious": "This is perhaps Brad Pitt at his best. The entire cast (and casting) is excellent. Leonardo gives a powerhouse performance. I was never bored. The ending is gratifying. Oh how I wish this ending was the real ending and the bad guys got severely whupped and punished. Only QT could make a film like this. His style is so strong and unmistakable. I loved the pit bull, Brandy; would love to have a dog like that one. Was Bruce Lee over-rated? Not sure. I suppose it's possible a bad ass stunt man could've put the whup on him. The soundtrack was just okay, I think I could've put together a better soundtrack. What's up with the women snoring? Does Q have something specific to say about it? I know he likes feet, and there's plenty of feet in this feature. I now own the film and plan to show it to buds. Well done Mr. T.", "So empty": "The movie was so long and so empty, 2 first hours of....NOTHING and why Margot Robbie was acting!? She was useless for the story. I am so disappointed because it seems that it would be a great movie", "What a joke": "Was looking so forward to this movie. So disapointed. Totally broke the chain of good quality movies.", "Shame": "Boring boring boring the movie has no meaning very slow events and after waiting 2 hr and 50 min we saw some action but it all was meaningless,\nQT You have disappointed your fans", "Great,but not for everyone": "This movie is great if you like other Tarantino films , if you like bloody scenes, this movie shows us what Tarantino thinks of the movie industry in the 60s , I do not blame you if you got board or got out of the theater, slot of people are going to hate it but not me I really enjoyed it ,", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood = Nothing worth mentioning actually happened in this \"movie\"!": "Quentin Tarantino movie?

Once Upon a Time In Hollywood was no exception.The dialogue was snappy, the soundtrack was spot on, and the cinematic landscape and scene setting was as detailed as you would expect. The leads in the primary storyline were great, Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt were excellent as two ageing buddies trying to adapt to the changing world around them. The movie at times pays so much tribute to the golden age of Hollywood it feels like a blend of a Tarantino and a Coen brothers movie. (which can't be a bad thing).The late 60's aesthetic is enhanced by the appearance of real-life characters; Bruce Lee on the studio back lot, and then at the Playboy Mansion during a party sequence, Mama Cass, and Steve McQueen amongst others joining Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. True to form there are a number of QT favourites making cameo appearances; Mike Madsen, Kurt Russell, Uma Thurman's daughter Maya Hawke, and Bruce Dern are examples. Otherwise there are cameos galore, my favourite supporting roles being Al Pacino's movie producer Marvin Schwartz, and Margaret Qualley's Charles Manson follower \"Pussycat\". (Qualley is another Hollywood 2nd generation cutting their teeth).Tarantino is at his best when he is writing original work, although as with Inglorious Basterds, he did show he can incorporate an alternative historical timeline to great effect. That is the intention of \"Once Upon a Time...\" with the climax of the movie taking an alternate view on what could have happened if the Manson Murders had been aimed at fictional characters Rick Dalton and his stuntman Cliff Booth, instead of Sharon Tate and friends.The film does have problems though, the story feels a little thin and lacks the depth of previous Tarantino outings. Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate as an angelic figure, and as such spends most of the movie just smiling and looking happy, filled with innocence without adding any further complexity to the character. The Manson gang are introduced in the form of a group of wandering homeless looking disciples dumpster diving for food. When Cliff later gets to meet them properly at Spahn Ranch, the only one that the viewer has had any real connection to is Pussycat.Yet, when we come to the climax of the movie and the Manson members attack Rick, Cliff, and Rick's Wife...Pussycat is not there, the only Manson member we would remember is \"Tex\", the horse riding second in command, but again there's no real connection to him other than remembering who he is. As a result the ending does lack a bit of punch,That being said, the ending does have some great comedic moments, mixed in with an expected level of blood and violence. It still manages to tie together elements of the story, with a class ending shot which is straight out of the 1960's. By anyone's standards it is a strong movie, but compared to Tarantino's standards, it is a little off the mark. However, would I watch it again? Yes, I absolutely would!!", "Tarantino does it again": "The movie was fantastic I disliked the thought of displaying Charles Manson but to learn about everything that happened back then felt like a cinema history lesson that I could sit and enjoy", "Okay, Yes!": "Typically and most wonderfully Quentin.\nAs I leave the theatre I have the expected feeling of \"I have to see this again!\"\nBrad actually comes back into view as a person of interest.\nLeo is as always .... Well, I don't want to face him in a shootout!\nAll in all it was a great twist on reality which we have all come to expect from the \"Quarentino\".", "Are you kidding me?": "If this script was someone's else it wouldn't even reached theatres. I think it is boring, useless, pointless. Dialogues are...omg i cannot even say how damn boring they were...Just a waste of time. I'm disappointed I wasted my time watching it. 2/10 is too much, consider it a gift In honor of good old times...Meh.", "Worst Movie of all Time, Seriously!": "Wow, QT's movies are always super entertaining until this lemon. It was painful to sit through this (no plot, no redeeming qualities and pure meaninglessness). They tried to fit in as many 60's songs as possible and tried so hard to nostalgic that it backfired as not nostalgic. The characters spent more time driving than they did in the movie \"The Mule\". What a waste of great actors (who by the way did have great performances) but the script cheated them with no substance. I wanted to give this movie a 2 or 3 but that would have been to generous.", "What a bore fest!": "If this move hadn't been made by Tarantino the score would be cut in half.\nBut since he's the director all his fans are trying to find some geniality in the movie that just isn't there. It's just sooo boring.Brad Pitt has one facial expression in the whole movie, and that's ok if he has a small side role, but not ok if he's on screen half of the movie. Margot Robbie side story is completely forgettable and disjointed from the rest of the movie, in fact you could cut all her scenes and nothing would change, except you would have to endure the flick for half hour less. DiCaprio stuttering sounds really forced and fake.There's some over the top action and acting in the end which is mildly entertaining but not enough to save the movie. It's completely unrealistic. The days of raw realistic acting of Reservoir Dogs are gone.A couple of things I liked: When Rick Dolton is struggling to deliver a good performance and then he's angry, talks to himself, comes back and then delivers a great performance. That was good, it showed some emotions and him overcoming his fears. Also the Bruce Lee bit was pretty good, Mike Moh was incredible.But all in all \"Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood\" is a boring disordered mish mash that I wish I hadn't seen .", "A love letter to the silver screen": "Most of, no All of the focus of this movie is on old classic Hollywood, its a love letter, an homage to the 50's silver Screen. Its interesting but there isn't really much of a plot here in terms of a movie. We follow Leonardo DiCaprio as screen actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double turned best friend Cliff Booth/Brad Pitt -both are flawless in their roles- as they struggle to keep pace with the swiftly evolving entertainment industry.While working to continue their notoriety they face the demise of the golden age and also the Manson family which is about the only part of this that feels Tarantino-esque as he again rewrites history and BBQs a couple of people in the pool. The cast of familiar faces taking on bit parts in this movie is a veritable whos-who. I particularly enjoyed seeing Sharon Tate, Bruce Lee, Steve McQueen. Bottom line It's good.", "Over rated waste of a starry cast": "I honestly think this is the most cynical film I have ever seen. Pointless and indulgent main story and the finale was corny beyond belief.", "Addictive": "It's literally addictive, I have been thinking for two days on the movie, it's fun & original. Maybe not for all audiences but definitely it's great", "My Favorite Tarantino movie": "After watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 4 times and rewatching Pulp Fiction, I've decided that Once Upon a Time... is hands down my fave Tarantino movie. This movie may become an iconic piece of pop culture and cinema. There are so many awesome things about it, that IDK where to begin.1. Cliff Booth is top 10 coolest characters of all time - Doc Holliday in Tombstone, Neo in Matrix, Deniro in Goodfellas, put in whoever - Brad Pitt nailed it. \"Don't cry in front of Mexicans.\"2. I like how they blended real people and events with fictional characters so seamlessly. LIke Cliff with Bruce Lee or the Manson Family3. The cast was unbelievably star-studded. Di Caprio and Pitt are the coolest guys of the last 20 years.4. The soundtrack is worth buying. Only Tarantino has the juice to put this cast and soundtrack together.I think that guys are going to appreciate this movie more than women will because women don't understand how to rate badass male characters. I like that Tarantino didn't go overboard with the graphic violence like he tends to do sometimes. I can appreciate someone being cut in half with a sword as much as the next 8th grader, but 30 minutes gets old. The only negative reviews you'll read about this flick are babies whining that it's misogynistic or racist or to white manish. It's a movie about white guys in the 60s and 70s, so that's the point. If get offended by this movie, don't write a bad review about the movie. Instead, go take your medication and watch Bravo.", "Hollywood in its purest form": "Quentin Tarantino has absolutely nailed it! He has constructed every second in the movie in a whole new level. The cast, i mean those legends who has put their talent in a way that no one could complain. I swear guys, this movie will not disappoint you.", "This is why cinema exist.": "Tarantino did the impossible, overcome himself. In the top of his career he demonstrated the maturity he has to write an intelligent, poetic and funny script at the same time, accompanied by a memorable direction. The first time, the anxiety of believing that you already know the end may slightly cloud our sight of what Tarantino is weaving in each scene, taking us through a calmer territory than the one we are accustomed, the story embarks us to an unforgettable end, announced by a diabolical guitar riff. The feeling at the end of seeing is confusing to the degree of believing that it may not be as good as we expected but for this it is important to see it a second time. Now knowing what this is about, we are ready to enjoy the best Mr. Tarantino movie. A round work of art, without gaps, without leftovers, a mastery of dialogues and ability to tell things without saying them through the camera. Leonardo Di Caprio what can we say about him? Thank you, thank you for showing us what acting is, next to a Brad Pitt full of style, the perfect people for the perfect characters. The soundtrack, the best achieved, accompanied with a subtlety and superb style to each sequence. A movie that asks you to observe, it provokes you to think and when you realize you only enjoy, again and again and again. Each year this movie will be better and better, reaching the height of Pulp Fiction even surpassing it. All those who went to seeing it to a movie theater, we should feel grateful for the moment we could live. This is why Tarantino is one of the best writers and directors in history and the damn do not even study at all! This is why cinema exists.", "Cinema Candy With Some Alt History Revision Per Tarantino": "OUTIH is pretty much a big love letter to early seventies Hollywood. It helps to have a total A-List cast no doubt. But it's the care in the recreation of a time and place that grabs the viewer. The story, until the Tarantino signature ending, is nothing too special other than it is quite a good palate for DiCaprio and Pitt to give us some memorable characters in a time of change in both politics and the entertainment business. What is special is the way it uses the Charles Manson gang. It's pure Quinton Tarantino alt history wrapping up things as he, and the audience, would have preferred. After the quite entertaining slow build-up it's a great pay-off elevating the movie several notches. It probably won't get the cult status of Pulp Fiction but it has lots of great period props and music, fine seventies Hollywood ambience shot with meticulous cinematography, and that quirky Tarantino pat dialogue. It's a mass audience appeal movie as such that retains a lot of the Tarantino DNA. I think it's a great ride.", "Bang average": "So to start on the positives this is visually stunning with a fantastic cast.But that aside this really is not a great film.No real story line just a collection of different episodes in various characters life.Overall this is quite interesting but if it wasn't Tarantino would it get such high praise?", "Bruce Lee??": "It's not funny \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb,every one who had seen the movie knows what I'm talking about.", "I was suprised about how bad it was": "Im not going to start this review by saying how much of an fan of QT i am but i went to watch it with two friends of mine and hyped them up.\nWell.. all this for nothing.\nWe left the cinema with akward conversations and explainings.. We thought we are too dumb to get the movie but reviews say otherwise..\nI dont want to say that the story was bad written but it just kept on going and nothing really happend.\nIm just disappointed.", "Nothing happens!": "My Rating : 5/10Slow, boring aside from the banter between the two awesome leads which is the highlight of this Tarantino feature.Tarantino is certainly trying to pull off another Pulp Fiction but fails due to the lack of fun factor that the 1994 classic had unfortunately.A faster pace, a tighter storyline and more memorable scenes and dialogues would have certainly made this a classic however it's far too inconsequential for that.Overall, I'm disappointed - Alas we'll always have the cult of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Kill Bill', along with 'True Romance' which is QT-written and deeply underrated.", "Almost 3 hours I'll never get back": "What a yarn! Almost three hours of going nowhere with 20 minutes of violent finale to keep Tarantino fans happy. Just don't get the point of the whole thing.", "The Final": "I had HUGE expectations for these movie, and it let me down a bit. I love the begining when DiCaprio is speacking with AlPacino (if he had a bit more screen time, i believe he could be nominated for an oscar) but after that the movie kinda drags. I LOVE Margot Robie but if you cut all her performance you wouldnt notice, because she isnt important for the plot, she just dances and watch her own movie basicaly... Leonardo DiCaprio performance was incredibleeee but after what he did on the Revenant i dont see the academy give him another oscar, but for sure he will be nominated. Brad Pitt character was good, and also his performance, but, i dont know.. it lack something. The CLIMAX OMG AHAHAHAHHA I N C R E D I B L E !!!!!!! I will not reveal any detail ahahha just watch the movie.\nSo i like this movie, but it lack a more straight to the point screenplay, many many characters that really dont add anything, but the movie worth the watch because it a DiCaprio Pitt Robbie and Tarantino (and many others) movie. I dont see tarantino get a nom for director, but yes for screenplay, but i dont think he will win any of it. At the oscars this movie only have a chance on costumes and production design and maybe something for the sound (until it come a time picture and a space one).\nTarantino movies (that i have watched) ranked\n1Inglorious Basterds\n2Hateful Eight\n3Pulp Fiction\n4Django Unchained\n5Reservoir Dogs\n6Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\n(7'8)Kill Bill 1 and 2", "Snore fest": "Long, boring movie.

Apollo 11, the Vietnam war and the anti war protests, Civil rights in the USA, the troubles in Ireland, the return of Elvis Presley, John And Yoko love in, the Beatles split, release of Abbey Road LP, get back, honky tonk woman, sugar sugar, suspicious minds singles, progressive rock, and at the movies Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid while counter culture was everywhere and then there was the Woodstock festival, nudity, long hair, drugs and sex lots of sex. Tarantino drops pop culture references all over the film, way to many to remember and while the great big TV thing goes way over my head, that box in the corner has never been that big a deal for me, but this is a hugely entertaining movie that despite it's lengthy running time simply fly's past thanks to Brad Pitt & Leonardo Titanic shear old fashioned movie star presence, that thing called star power. With 20 minutes to go suddenly there is this major shift in direction and suddenly shockingly and surprisingly the flick becomes a Tarantino movie after all. Brilliant! So far the only Tarantino film that resonated with me has been Jackie Brown, so this film is for me, by some way his masterpiece, Fantastic 9/10", "Could have been cut down to 15min": "Yeap.... Sorry QT, but this one did nothing more than entertain me for 15min. Surprised with 8/10 iDMB reviews.... Really. Makes me doubt all the other reviews given.", "Reality and innocence": "After having seen the movie for 2 times already, I've read more than 100 reviews of it, everywhere that they're available: professional and audiences.\nThus, I feel I have something to add.\nReality: the issue of reconstruction of 1969 reality as alt-reality is questionable. I think that the alt-reality that we can see in OUATIH is an alt-reality of any reality \"in the last 50 years\". The story is \"anchored\" in 1969 for certain practical purposes, however the main story is about generations, paradigms, shifts, redefinition of oneself. The \"aging and obsoletion\" motive is as old as anything, it doesn't necessarily apply to Hollywood or to a certain period of time. The catch is if (or how) to overcome such tendency in a person's (actor's, artist's) life, or not to overcome, of course.\nThe other theme, obviously, is innocence, and the loss of it. Or not, again. Since the last 2 days I've done some research on Sharon Tate's life up to August of 1969 - whatever is actually available on the Internet. The (partial) outcome is that Margot Robbie cannot really represent Sharon Tate. She cannot recapture the lost innocence.\nWhen we look at the combination of the above themes, it is obvious that: the movie should have been set exactly in 1969, that the laid-back presentation of Leonardo's and Brad's roles could be put in that context only, that QT is making full circle of his canon exactly with this movie: he cannot make another movie in the same set-up, and this alt-reality is the ultimate one, and the innocence has been lost then and there, probably forever.\nThe real question, therefore, is: what will QT do next?", "I don't know why people love this movie?": "I love the cast so much but this is one of the most boring movies I ever watched (especially with a big budget movie)\nWhat's the point of this movie? It felt very random and it led to nothing. Perhaps because I'm not american I didn't get the humor as of cultural differences?? I really want to know why some people loved it that much..", "Thank You Tarantino": "Thank You Mr Tarantino for this MASTERPIECE\nIt's surpassed my expectations\nI was watching it like a child I was Smiling Clapping and dreaming about each scene and wishing I was there at the shooting\nI will rewatch it againONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD\nOscar Best Picture\nOscar Best Actor In Leading Role Leonardo DiCaprio\nOscar Best Editing\nOscar Best Production Design\nOscar Best Costume Design\nOscar Best Cinematography", "10/10 Amazing!": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was one of the best movies I've ever seen, hands down. I really liked the whole 60s vibe, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were amazing, and the last half an hour or so were so intense and in a very Tarantino style. Definitely recommend it, though it would help if you are familiar with at least a few of Tarantino's movies, as it was a bit confusing for my friends who went to watch the movie with me as he hasn't watched any of his movies so far.", "Incredibly good": "You need the typical Tarantino vibe to enjoy this movie at it's best, it's so refreshing to see this movie.", "Tarantino's attempt at an Altman or Coen Brothers movie.": "But it inevitably comes across as a series of cute ideas that eventually trivializes and exploits its subjects.Altamont and the Manson murders signaled the demise of the peace and free love movement that in 1969 traded daisy chains for butcher knives. The year was not the end of some golden era of cinema; it was the tipping point for culture as a whole. The Age of Aquarius was about to drown its folksy innocence in its own blood. In the following year, television would begin to purge itself of homespun shows and move to the edgier, darker and more urban. So yes, this film gets a small bit of its impetus right.I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes involving Rick Dalton's new villainous image. The young actress he co-stars with is a delight. But beyond that, so much of the film seemed like vignettes for the sake of what-if. \"Oh, Bruce Lee was alive back then. Let's throw in a bit with him.\" Okay, now show me why. Oh, they broke that Australian lady's car. Um, right. The scene with Pitt going to Spahn Ranch was to state they got Lena Dunham, Dakota Fanning and Bruce Dern in cameos? Got it. Because it didn't affect the plot.For a Tarantino film, there were less and less truly iconic scenes than ever, and practically no quotable lines. This movie will be known for what? Flame throwers, Robbie's dirty feet and a tenacious pit bull? Ho hum.The performances are basically fine - mostly actors playing types not characters. Even the impersonations of actual players seem cursory and perfunctory. Robbie's Tate is just Robbie playing an actress. Tate had a glance, an aura, a way. Robbie doesn't capture any of that for me. Tarantino has specifically stated that the character was more of a symbol anyway. Oh boy, let's get to that now.The alternate reality ending was a concept that surely sounded good on paper to Tarantino. Yeah, who doesn't fantasize about going back and rewriting history, whether to save a million people, or a beautiful neighbor and her friends? The premise worked slightly better in Inglorious B*st*rds. Why? Because the intent was there: to stop the textbook definition of a genocidal maniac. Rick and Cliff bumbling into Tex and the Girls then having a farcical fight to the death doesn't save Sharon and restore some supposedly dwindling Hollywood period. It uses the memory then cheapens it, and eventually obliterates it. In so many sad ways, Sharon was the ultimate sacrifice of beauty and modesty. She had a fate that immortalized her. In this film, she is now the actress lady who lived next door to a couple of has-beens who beat up a bunch of equally goofy dirtbags who might have wanted to randomly harm her but probably would have messed it up because Tarantino has intentionally portrayed them as totally and comically inept. This would work in a Coen caper with randoms but Tarantino had to shoe-horn the Tate aspect in.The soundtrack is a joy. It plays over a lot of driving tours of historic LA - so if you like that sort of thing, there is nostalgic use of music. But otherwise, this movie was lacking that cohesive thread that held something like The Player or Nashville together. It's an ending with some stuff leading up to it.", "Great QT Film!": "This is another Great QT Film! It can be Boring to some, but you need to basically understand things from the correct perspective.Rick (Leonardo DiCaprio) & Cliff (Brad Pitt) are like identical twin brothers, who work in filmmaking. Rick's the real celebrity (now failing because of new genres) & Cliff is Rick's stunt double. Cliff continues to look like Rick, so he can be blindly seen on screen doing & during the fights.Being like identical twins, in the looks, they aren't in their lives. They both have very different personalities, Rick's the more serious & struggling one; while Cliff open for fun & adventure. Cliff's willing to take that chance of facing trouble, and Rick won't.Throughout the movie one needs to see both Leo & Brad as if they are almost identical twins. And also see how one's action filled life, can possibly lead to changing the other's.", "Ingenious and a great homage to the 60s": "I loved this film, but I can understand how it could divide opinion.

A must see...", "Bruce Lee Fans don't Hate!! ****Minor Spoiler***": "I am a huge Bruce Lee fan and at first I caught feelings because Tarantino depicted Bruce Lee like an arrogant over confident. Then after watching the entire movie, I realized how amazing this movie is. Tarantino is simply one of the best to do it, well done Tarantino!For those of you who hate the way Bruce Lee was portrayed! Hear me out!!!It's fictional, Bruce Lee is an icon and Tarantino knows it. I of all people respect and love Bruce Lee as much as any other fan. This movie was brilliant and is a story set to build characters while using true events and people. When your in a Tarantino movie anything can happen! \"For Bruce Lee's daughter\" I think it would have been disrespectful to even ask permission to portray a fake version of your father in this way. That makes no sense. Tarantino showed other scenes of Bruce teaching SharonTate and obviously wasn't out to bash Bruce. Brad's Pitts character was the main \"tough\" guy character and who better to beat up then the infamous Bruce Lee. This movie was so good. People should recognize it was fake. This was not a diss to Bruce lee whatsoever. The acting and directing was genius. 10 stars Tarantino.P.S. who knows wtf is truly going on in Tarantino's mind truly thou. If he was truly trying to diss Bruce Lee legacy. Than I can only help to think he's got a personal beef or he's just a fkn hater and can suck it. (That's how much I fkn respect Bruce Lee Yo')Go watch this movie and don't compare it with other Tarantino films! peace im out", "Closest we'll ever get to a Pulp Fiction sequel!": "Right off the bat I was into this movie! One thing Tarantino is a master at is writing dialogue, and there is quite a bit of dialogue in this movie, most of it is just talking but it's the kind of chatting that pulls you even more into these characters. The movie had a very similar style of story telling to Pulp Fiction which was great. The end climax of the film was just what I was waiting for and more, I walked out of this movie very satisfied and if you're a fan of Tarantino, you will too.", "Cliff Booth is officially the coolest movie character of all time!!": "That's it. That's my whole piece. Coolest movie character OF ALL TIME!!! He's Brad Pitt being Brad Pitt On steroids. I'm genuinely obsessed.", "Self indulgent and just plain DULL!": "I am a huge fan but Tarantino looks like he made this purely for his own entertainment and show off just how much of a movie nerd he is to his mates and forgot about everything else.\nFor the majority of the rest of his audience looking to be entertained by the normal Tarantino excellence containing wit, crackling dialogue, fast pace, action, twists, stellar soundtrack and fantastic visuals - this is not that movie.\nI gave it a very generous 4 only because there are few moments of genuine class and the final 25mins is fun. Other than that, dire.", "3 guys with self inflated egos .": "QT, BP, and LD really love..... themselves . That's the only thing to surmise from this borefest. Even the music bored me .

For the info, bruce lee wasn't defeated by anyone, he was only defeated when he was a kid at 12. Most of his challengers were down in less than a minute, the longest guy lasted like 3 minutes running away from him, even professional fighters were like amateurs to him, let alone got beaten by some silly stuntman.", "Waste of time": "It's very bad movie, spoils your day and mood.\nActually it's waste of time and not recommended to be watched.", "Very good! Not surprised": "I can't think of a single movie starred by Leonardo DiCaprio that I don't like. Once again he was great and Brad as well. Was missing the blood from Tarantino until the end when I gets messy. Really worth watching.", "Worst Tarantino ever.": "He needed about two hours to do his usual bloodbath. And that two hours were the best of the movie. The more I watch of his movies, the more I get the impression that his writing lacks to the end. I got the impression, that he doesn't really know how to end a story without being violent. I guess this is his recipe. Tell something, show some feet in-between and then the bloody showdown. To watch his movies was much more nice at 'Pulp Fiction', it was much more nice at 'Kill Bill' and even at 'Inglourious Basterds', but does it ever have to be \"the same\" end? I'm bored by always seeing his brute force and violence fantasies in variations. He has no surprise in his movies, at the end it's always the same. He, who is called a genius surely should be able to do better. But I must admit, that I had to laugh strongly at the Bruce Lee moments.", "Tarantino's worst movie": "It didn't feel like continuous story, but random pieces put together that doesn't bring you anywhere.The things that save this movie the most, are the actors performances and the fact that the era was captured really well.", "Tarantino meets \"They All Laughed\" (1981)": "Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is an homage to cinema as a whole, as well as the 1960's, the Manson family, the battle between the big & the small screen, the auteur's early life, among many other things. I saw an interview with him on youtube where he compared this film to Alfonso Cauron's \"Roma,\" in the sense that it's a cinematic memory piece. While he's certainly correct about the similarity (the period piece setting, long takes, sun-soaked cinematography, etc) even made me think of it too honestly, there's an even more specific film that Tarantino's film subconsciously borrows much from, and it's Peter Bogdonavich's \"They All Laughed\" (1981), which not so coincidentally is a vocal favorite of his, much as \"Rio Bravo\", \"The Great Escape\", and anything Sergio Leone (or Corbucci, who's even mentioned in the third act at length) has ever made, and makes obvious references to in its 162-minute length.Both \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" and \"They All Laughed\" carry a joie de vivre tone that's contrasted by a sense of melancholy; doom even. In \"They All Laughed\", it's the tragic fate of Dorothy Stratten that preceded the film's release date that gave it this nearly unexplainable feeling, and in Quentin's film, it's Sharon Tate who carries this same exact energy for precisely the same reasons as Bogdonavich's 1981 misfire did. It's a beautiful blonde white starlet that the director clearly loves, who edits her footage as lovingly as possible, knowing that in the real world, she suffered a fate much more brutal and dehumanizing than she deserved. Audiences can feel it, but they'll never truly understand the pain behind making these cuts behind the scenes. All you know is they want her to be remembered as lovingly as possible.This similarity is even more striking when you ruminate the parallel plot structures: three groups of people, off on their own adventures in a very limited set of time (one weekend) in a famous American city (LA vs NYC), but a crucial one nonetheless, as these characters not only take us through their usual routine while spouting catchy dialogue and making friends with almost any stranger that crosses their rose-colored paths, but the intersection of these various characters' lives, and the more we get to know them and spend time with them, the more we care about the mundane tasks they do throughout the day, just like you and I do.Similar to Tarantino's magnum opus, \"Inglourious Basterds\", this film toys around with history in ways that are both entertaining as hell, if you're completely willing to suspend disbelief-but pity to those who can't during one of his movies-and fascinating, as a potential timeline to how the world could've been different onwards (and that's a movie you gotta make in your own mind, as I'm assuming Tarantino wants you to do anyway). In the 2009 film we see Hitler's face get shot into hamburger meat. In this film, we see....well don't let me spoil it for you. But it's equally satisfying if you get my drift.He's never referenced \"They All Laughed\" as an influence, but if you've seen the Bogdonavich film and read his Sight & Sound Top 10 from 2002 (it's on the list), it's not a stretch to say that film had some impact on this film's final result. Both movies are from the perspective of directors who experienced early success, had some failures along the way, and felt severe loss. The 1981 film had the misfortune of shooting his star-crossed starlet not knowing she will die soon, while Tarantino shot his film knowing his starlet has died, but still gives her a chance to live again-not just on the big screen as only few personally had known, but for a whole new generation of moviegoers who may have never heard of her, her infamous murder, or even \"Valley of the Dolls\" or \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" (or so help me, Roman Polanski). But what both films do successfully is give us a sweet little time capsule with these significant pop culture figures and show us what life was like before the luckiest of human beings experienced their darkest of times.", "You just don't see movies like this anymore": "This is classic QT, showing that he is still at the top of his class when it comes to filmmaking. Plot has little to do with most Tarantino films, and this one is no exception. This film has great dialogue and beautiful set design and cinematography. The characters are all fleshed out and the acting is top-notch. Instead of going with a simple Hollywood formula (conventional plot and screenplay), QT sticks to what he knows best and makes a movie similar to his others, while also expanding upon typical Tarantino-isms (the film is more rooted in comedy than his others). Overall, this not a movie you see nowadays in Hollywood. It is sad that we only get one more QT film!", "Well acted, but I prefer a movie with a plot": "Nothing happens in this movie until the very, and what does happen is extremely violent and gruesome.\nThe movie is credits for creating a great visual of Hollywood in 1969. However, Rick flew from Europe on 747, and the 747 didn't enter service until 1970, and the Tate murders occurred in 1969. It might seem minor, but since the visuals of the time period, it's an error.So much of the plot was contrived and unnecessary. It takes about 2 hours to get him to Europe to resurrect his career, and then a voice over comes on and movie rushes through 6 months where Rick does 4 movies, gets married, and for some reason decides to move back to Hollywood with his new Italian wife while firing his best friend.", "Pitt and DeCaprio on top form": "DeCaprio and Pitt as your two leads is a great start to any movie, and here they show off not just their own talent, but that they also have a great on-screen chemistry. This in-turn perfectly compliments Tarantino's obsession with classic Hollywood - be it film or TV. So every frame is packed with niche references to highlight the move of Hollywood productions from the big to the small screen, as TV begins to flex it's entertainment muscle. All nicely setting the scene as we follow the dramatic and personal trials of film actor Rick Dalton (DeCaprio) struggling to revitalise his career, and his attempt to escape his decent into typecasting as villian of the week on a string of TV dramas. Ably supported by long time stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt), this becomes quite an insightful piece into a talented artists decline and how they do or don't cope with their situation. All culminating in struggle of artistic talent on the set of a Western adventure series, and a moment of surprising reflection from a younger member of the cast. Of course with this being a Tarantino film there has to be an added aspect to the whole thing and he's chosen to include the infamous Manson murders and in particular the fate of Sharon Tate. Going into this film I had great reservations about the whole aspect of this in the film and I still wish that he had concentrated on his two principles rather than adding this superfluous storyline. However I do have to acknowledge that is handled much better than I could possibly imagine, and with the title of this film does make perfect sense. And as a small word of warning the 18 cert may seem our of place for much of the running time, it is needed !", "I've never written a review before": "I've never written a review on IMDb before, but this film deserves one. Simply fantastic and it didn't feel as long as the running time states. Clearly it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, due to the slower pace of the film, as we're now in a society that demands instant gratification, with minimal attention spans. It's actually incredibly refreshing to see something outside of the modern norm, of high paced action scenes.Pitt and De Caprio's chemistry on screen is fantastic. The dialogue for both is subtle yet gripping, with a good dose of humour too.The finale of the film is built up throughout, with the tension erupting at the very end, in a very satisfying conclusion. It left me wanting more. Tarantino is the best filmmaker of our time.", "A masterpiece but Not for everyone": "This film is a masterpiece, it depicts the 60s lifestyle in all its glory, Is not for everyone though, you have to invest some time into learning who the Manson Family was, and who is Sharon Tate.The film is a mixture of historical facts and fiction, it depicts 1960s Los Angeles in a very romantic way, the bromance between Rick and Cliff works extremely well, excellent performance by both actors.", "Bloated, lethargic, self-indulgent and pointless": "Only Hollywood insiders would have the vanity and self adoration to put this forward for the awards it was nominated for.Took me nowhere, entertained my not at all...", "Django shouldve been his last film": "I understand the love for old Hollywood and the nostalgia part. I understand the love for the classical movies, which he does a great job honoring them here.STILL... there was no story. No goals for the characters. No meaning.

This movie looked like if someone tries to copy Tarantino, not a movie by Tarantino himself.\nIt was really really boring.Its not a film for the audience, its a film for filmmakers.", "Unwatchable, Contrived, Celebrity, Pap,": "No plot, no momentum, All character development visibly taking place under a crane with make up on, contrived, short scenes which lack authenticity, boring, lacking humor in the set itself, which reflects on the slightly tense habit of the scenes, which detracts from the humor. Conversations are completely boring, acting is unconvincing.Tarantino has forgotten his roots: He doesn't hire small time actors enough, and when he does, they are very good... The character development scenes are not actually conversations, they are short edits of perspectives of line-readings... the atmosphere flows like a piecemeal of tense acting and short edits.Some of the art work is very good and very vibrant, but the subject matter is silly... A celebrity director writing about celebrity history with his celebrity friends, for a story that is absent, locations that have little identity or events, it's as if he has wrapped himself up so much in hollywood that he now lives in a tarantino disney world.booo!", "If you didn't \"get it\" you never will...": "Not all things are for general consumption.\nQ.T. makes films for a certain movie goer.\nThis is just what it is, a film about films with historical knods and sheepish grins towards the people that influenced Q.T.If you want jaw dropping c.g., quick one liners and catch phrases, there is an entire universe created just for you.Some of us left our comics at home and went out to experience the real world with all its flaws and occasional beauty, the chosen few get to make movies about it.", "Just misses the mark...": "Overlong with a thin plot makes for perseverance from the viewer. Whilst some scenes are classic Tarantino...much of it is pretty drab...scenes of people driving....? Difficult to agree with Brad's Oscar...and other awards garnered....highlight for me as the soundtrack...not a film I will ever watch again....!", "Good, Refreshing, Non-Comic Book-Movie, with Great Acting, Directing, Editing, and Lots of Fun": "I really enjoyed this movie. It's just a lot of fun. It's very interesting and different. Most of the movie is DiCaprio's Rick Dalton struggling to stay relevant and keep getting work as an aging actor, and the realities that occur on the sets of his shows.Pitt is very entertaining as Dalton's carefree stunt double, Cliff Booth, who- legend has it- once challenged Bruce Lee to a fight on set and beat him. And Margot Robbie is delightful, charming, beautiful, and charismatic as young, up-and-coming starlet Sharon Tate, who just got married to famous filmmaker Roman Polanski.You can enjoy a ride through 1969 Los Angeles, passing through the Playboy Mansion, the Hollywood Hills, Burbank, along the freeway, down Ventura, and all the way to Chatsworth, to Spahn Ranch, where a group of hippies are gathering. Rick and Cliff have been in showbusiness and Hollywood for a while, and they have noticed how hippies have begun showing up around town, hitchhiking, and stirring trouble at times.This is one of Tarantino's best films, and it's because he doesn't overindulge as much as usual. His directing is more toned-down and writing more reserved. There is more of a sense of realism in Once Upon a Time than anything sensational, like his last five movies or so. In this way, I guess you can say that the film in his catalogue that comes closest to this one is Jackie Brown.This movie is more concerned with the realities of Hollywood in 1969, and the realities of the industry for a few various different actors getting work. As such, it is a lot of fun and full of laughs, a quirky style, and a good time.It might just be me, but I almost find this kind of movie nonexistent out of Hollywood in recent years; it seems that if it's not CGI, comic book, Star Wars, or other movies with lots of explosions (usually unoriginal, done before, or remakes), then it hardly gets made or any attention.Fortunately, Tarantino has given us something more down to earth, historical, and true-to-life with a cast of great actors who bring their A-games to their roles. This is definitely a movie not to take too seriously, but just to sit back, immerse yourself in the time period/era, and just have a good time. If you get the sense of humor and quirks on display at times, you will definitely do just that.", "Yet another example of how overrated Tarantino is.": "A movie with zero substance, much like its director. Just a bunch of pointless scenes that glorify white male violence, complete with misogynistic body shots of Margot Robbie, who gets about two lines in the whole movie. Tarantino also continues his pattern of ridiculing Asian men, with a scene solely to attack the legacy of Bruce Lee. If anyone tells you this movie is deep or intellectual, they are delusional.", "Average Tarantino film; still worth a one time watch": "I'm not the biggest Tarantino fan, but I respect his style and love of filmmaking. It's not for me, but he's definitely left a unique calling in the timeline of film. Going into this, I knew exactly what to expect - an enticing setup, a slow middle-act build, and an extreme climax. That's exactly what I got.If you know his work, this will be enough film to digest. It's definitely not his best, but I'm happy to see films that don't stick to conformations of established story-telling. Everything you want is there- long drawn out scenes, biblical quotes, extreme violence and awkward comedy. And that's pretty much all I can say.Brad Pitt is the clear stand out, and Margot Robbie has no role (don't expect much from her plot). Leo also does a stellar. And that's the point- there's really not much to go on about. This film depicts a collection of events that took place in 60's Hollywood, that may or may not contribute to an overall story arc. Everyone does their jobs pretty well.Fans of Tarantino will find moments to enjoy,but I must emphasize the following :\nIf you're not aware of his film style, and if you're a casual movie goer who needs compelling plot and action driven moments, please skip this movie. There is nothing here for you.\nI will probably never watch this again, but for a one time viewing, it's not bad.", "Money DiCaprio": "Cannot stand that guy.\nNot sure why he thinks that once he receives enough of a salary he can stop trying.\nThe rest of the movie is bad also, but nothing short of the obvious fun Leo has being an actor.\nGive me a break", "Pretentious": "What a pretentious film. And here I thought this would be better than hobbs and shaw", "By far my least favorite Tarantino Movie": "Since the story is based on real life events, I - like probably everybody who watched the Movie - was expecting how the Movie ends.It will not end this way and I am wholeheartedly unsatisfied with the ending.The last 20 Minutes felt very rushed after Rick had the Italy Journey, but the rest of the Movie had some long dragging moments which could have been easily cut without losing anything.While QT still shows off most of his talents, I feel like he should leave stories based of real life people alone.A portrayal of one of the worst murders in Hollywood History should have been shown as that and not as fictional and cheap ending.I love Tarantino Movies, but not this one.", "Nobody tells a story better than Tarantino!": "I LOVE this movie! It is the kind of movie that makes you feel good about making movies - that someone cares enough to take the time to tell a story that feels so special. It is long, but mesmerizing; and it pays off so well. As storytelling, it clearly mirrors another Tarantino film in its approach, but I don't want to give anything away.From the casting, to the music to the sets, the dialog and of course the story. This movie is a beautiful homage to Hollywood that should be nominated for many Oscars. Having grown up around L.A. at that time, Tarantino made the location for this story as important as any actor in the film and gave it the complete feel of the period. There is no doubt he intimately knows and loves Hollywood - the city and the industry - with all of its flaws, and this movie shows it.There is so much packed into this film, I will definitely be watching it again. I don't know how Tarantino can move so effortlessly between comedy and drama, but he is the best ever at doing it. Brad and Leonardo are both crazy excellent in this film, and there are many other actors who deliver exceptional and/or surprising performances. I left the theatre with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. Bravo!", "Tarantino once again!": "Tarantino does it once again! He proved that he is one of the best directors.\nThis is the best movie of the year right now, and will definitely be at the oscars.", "DiCaprio and Pitt are great together": "I loved this movie which showed parts of 1960s Hollywood. DiCaprio is soooo good in his portrayal of Rick, the movie star who is no longer on the \"A\" list but whose heart wishes he still was. Your heart aches for him. Brad Pitt is super cool as Cliff the stuntdouble. He is the embodiment of the best friend who sticks by you through thick and thin. Great movie! Go and see it.", "Someone said this was a great movie...What Happened...?": "That's all I can say...there just isn't any substance to this...", "Sealed the Deal": "I've given up even attempting to watch anything new coming out. But every now and then there will be a project with 'used to be good' names attached, and so... I'll give a shot. At about 45 minutes in, I was done.QT and Scorsese were the last 2 I had hope for, and both their recent projects were boring as hell.I hang out with all kinds of different people, and none of them liked this film.\nSomething weird is going on.\nThe circuses are as poisoned as the bread.\nMaybe they're trying to get us to not care about money by not producing anything that's worth spending it on.One thing is for sure, in all aspects, American exceptionalism has gone the way of the woolly mammoth.", "What is it all about !!?": "Boring, pointless, silly, shallow , boring.. typical Tarantino\nSomehow this was supposed to be funny which is not at all, or documentary... But it has faked history so its not too. All the time I was wondering what does Tarantino what to say... that he likes the 60s !!? So what..Margot Robbie keeps smiling and dancing the whole time, what the special in that!?.

All the characters were unique, dialog felt real and natural, and the pacing was perfect. I'm not the hugest Tarantino fan, but damned if this movie didn't nail it on all fronts. \ud83d\udc4d", "A Fractured Fairy Tale - Tarantino Style": "GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Yes, the 60's were a wild time, but not as out of control as Quentin Tarantino's latest effort. It's his unfocused screenplay that undermines his movie.JIM'S REVIEW: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a very fractured fairy tale of late 60's LA. The film is 80% period atmosphere, 10% pop music, 8% star gazing, and 2% story, plot, and character development. Director / Writer Quentin Tarantino sets up an intriguing scenario and serves up his happily-ever-after revisionist ending once again (which seems to be an annoying reoccurring theme with this filmmaker of late). This time, the results are disappointing.Mr.Tarantino continually hones his craft as he repeatedly knows how to stage and build his scenes artistically, but that skill does not hide the empty and banal script. He seems more interested in cruising the streets with the radio blasting oldie hits or celebrating the golden age of Tinseltown with insider knowledge of filmdom than developing an intricate or interesting storyline.Far too much screen time is spent on period details, from movie marquees extolling B movies, nostalgic action TV shows, the western genre, and mod outfits than fleshing out his central characters and their relationships. The movie meanders from one set pieces to the next and builds pretension rather than tension. The screenplay takes nearly an hour to finally get to its basic plot and takes even more detours than necessary on its long and winding road to glory and gory.Fortunately, Mr. Tarantino has two star actors in his buddy film and they do some heavy lifting to add more bravado to their machismo stock roles. Leonardo DICaprio plays Rick Dalton, an down-on-his-luck alcoholic actor hoping to revive his failing career. Brad Pitt is Rick's loyal sidekick and best bud, Cliff Booth, his longtime stunt double who now serves as his gofer and number one fan. Their lives intertwine as do the events of Rick's neighbors: Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate, Charles Manson and his hippie clan. The two legendary actors use their already established screen personas to maximum advantage and they are very good, deserving of better material.The stargazing continues with the film's large ensemble. A perfectly cast Margot Robbie exemplifies the late Sharon Tate, but her role is underwritten. It's a shame that this throwaway role was downplayed and given minor status. The actress could have made a lasting impression with more screen time. Al Pacino is fun to watch as a slick Hollywood producer as is the reliable Bruce Dern. Providing solid support are Margaret Qualley and Dakota Fanning as two of Manson's followers, Timothy Olyphant as real-life actor, James Stacy, and a memorable turn by child actress, Julia Butters. Kurt Russell turns up as does Emile Hirsch and Luke Perry (his last film role) in what amounts to mere cameos. Mike Mohl as Bruce Lee is slightly amusing in his politically incorrect interpretation of Bruce Lee, but a miscast Damien Lewis fumbles as Steve McQueen for a mercilessly short time.Despite its many flaws,Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is a well crafted movie with top notch production values. Wonderful cinematography by Robert Richardson, detailed set design by Barbara Ling and Nancy Haigh, and Arianne Phillips' period costumes celebrate the era with sly assurance, even if the movie ultimately fails due to Mr. Tarantino's unfocused script (and Fred Raskins' editing which needs more judicious cutting). The director's virtuoso excesses are still there for his fanbase, but his usual clever dialog is absent for the most part. This is one of Mr. Tarantino's weakest efforts to date.But expect the unexpected...if that is sufficient enough. This is a Tarantino film after all, even if he sadly drifts into \"what if\" territory. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood should have much to say, but the words and overwrought multiple stories get in the way. Major rewrites were needed and went unheeded. It is another case of a Hollywood screenwriter letting down a Hollywood director (and the moviegoing audience). Too bad it is one and the same person. Very fractured indeed.NOTE: A very funny post credits sequence is the best part of the film. Stay to see the tongue-firmly-in cheek Red Apple Cigarette commercial. It is a hoot!", "Waste of money and time": "My kids and I are huge fans of qt so this was the perfect film..or so we thought. The z generation don't understand the nuanced references, my age group do, but it's such a boring film. I get that qt was wanting to see how Hollywood, and the carefree culture at the time, would jave been affected if the Manson murders didn't happen. But this film was a lot of over indulgence, archaic references nobody cared about and an overkill scene that didn't make up for the excruciating boredom of nearly THREE hours! I have never seen people walk out of a qt film before, and they were leaving in droves after two hours of nothing. At one point my partner and I were having a thumb war for something to do and noughts and crosses on our phones. Cue the 10/10 emporers new clothes reviews screaming \"make up your own mind!!\" And \"Don't listen to the critics!!!\". Terrible and I want my money and time back.", "What am I missing?": "Just sat through almost 3 hours of this meandering film. Sorry, just don't get it. I think this was arguably QT's worst and most boring film to date. The first 2 hours bored me to death to get to the payoff in the last 30. Missing were the clever dialogue and uncomfortable moments QT is famous for. There were some walk-outs in the audience halfway through. No clapping at the end, no happy chatter amongst the remaining crowd on the way out. Plenty of grumbling with quite a few people using the word \"crap\" on their way to their cars.", "Maybe the worst movie in history": "This movie was maybe the worst I've ever seen.. and thats not a joke.\nTarantino said himself that he has run out of ideas, and he's stepping down... after watching this cr*p, I think thats en excellent idea.\nNot worth waisting time on in my opinion.", "More Misdirection Than Penn and Teller": "Tarantino has stated that \"Once\" is not Sharon Tate's movie. It's Rick Dalton's story. Yes, we get to ride the emotional rollercoaster of a man losing his place in his society, then discovering \"too little, too late\" that he may have had the acting chops all along that could have saved him from his plight. While that tempest rages we get to glide along with Cliff Booth, who possesses the self assurance of a man adept at martial arts with the ability to have anyone \"do anything you want to him. Throw him off a building, alright? Light him on fire. Hit him with a Lincoln, right? Get creative. Do whatever you want ...\" Cliff's journey stands in sharp counterpoint to the star he shadows.But what of Sharon Tate? Her little snippets (not even vignettes) pepper the movie, and leads to ..... WHAT?In the movie, had she not been featured the way she was, she would have (as in real life) been viewed as just another blonde bimbo starlet snatched up as so much candy on a successful director's arm. The movie provides us an opportunity to get to know Sharon (unlike real life), as a pretty young woman who has maintained her humanity, her friendliness, her affection for her friends and her public, and her warm affinity for all she meets. Her interaction with the ticket taker and the manager of the theater, her quiet enjoyment of the audience enjoying her point to a woman of depth of character, someone worth knowing. Someone worth grieving over.Reviews have been written about the over the top violence ending this film. Yet none of the violence compares to that actually perpetrated against Sharon and her friends in real life. To know this young woman was repeatedly knifed while her unborn child was carved from her body, to imagine the Manson family reveling in their blood lust, scrawling the word \"PIG\" on the walls in the young mother's blood, to know she begged for mercy having done nothing at all to provoke the mayhem performed on her makes the movie violence seen here a footnote to the atrocity that actually occurred.Understanding this, we're left with a piquancy, a longing sadness, barely buoyed by the ending offered by the film. For those criticizing the film for being too slow, for those debasing this effort as not providing enough tension, for the rabid shoot-em-up fans I suggest they view this as a trick performed by the expert magicians, Penn and Teller. It looks like a revenge fantasy: nope, it's a character study. HA! Fooled you all again! It's a rom-com! And like any Tarantino movie, twisting all our expectations, the ending to his rom-com leaves you with an aching heart.", "Meaningless movie": "No need to write a reviews\nThe subject speaks for itself", "Classic Tarantino!": "Quentin Tarantino is back and this time it is all about Hollywood. The movie does not have a lot of classic Tarantino style violence (except for the last 15 mins), but it is thoroughly enjoyable.\nLeonardo Di Capiro shines as Rick Dalton, but the best character of the movie is played by Brad Pitt as Dalton's stuntman Cliff Booth. Margot Robbie is great as Sharon Tate, but doesn't get much screen time. The only thing I don't understand about the movie is the casting of Al Pacino. Eighty percent of his screen time in the movie has been shown in the trailer, so you can understand that it is not a big one. Did not get why Tarantino needed a heavyweight like Pacino to play that role, probably because he really wanted to have him in one of his movies.\nThe cinematography is great, so are the background music. The film really makes you feel like you are in another era, Supporting cast is good as well.\nThere is a twist at the end, kind of like the one Tarantino pulled off in Inglourious Basterds, won't say more about it, please watch to find out. Whether you will like it depends on you, I enjoyed the whole ride!", "Tarantino's love letter to the golden age 10/10": "\"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" is a perfect movie and an awesome one. Especially for those who are film buffs and love \"easter eggs\" in movies. Many consider this movie to be Tarantino's love letter to the golden age of Hollywood back in the 60's. and I agree, it feels like Tarantino wanted to make a movie that really looks like the 60's, with the whole production design and set decoration that make the movie fabulous and nail it. the original story that Tarantino created about a former actor of the 50's and his stuntman double trying to find a new gig in the golden age of Hollywood is nothing more than brilliant, aside you have the story of Sharon Tate months prior to her murder. I absolutely loved every moment of the film: the colors, the long shots and camera movements, the props, the costume design, the soundtrack that matched the tone of the film because it's the 60's (one of the best soundtracks I've heard). Every shot and scene I was attached to, the only sequence I didn't like and felt could have been cut off was the one at the Spawn ranch with the Manson family. I just didn't understand the whole tension and meaning of the scene. Anyway most scenes I loved during the film were: the fight between Cliff Booth and Bruce Lee, Rick Dalton's scenes on set of \"Lancer\" and the scenes with Marwin Schwartz. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are a dynamic duo in this picture and have created one of the best friendships on screen ever. I believe their characters Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Pitt) are among the best characters Tarantino wrote in a while, Margot Robbie is adorable and gives her character a whole new life. of course we see during the movie other actors that Tarantino has worked with them before in his previous movies such as: Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Zo\u00eb Bell, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth and more. I believe this is the first time Al Pacino is in a Tarantino movie and well, he really leaves a mark. Something I felt was missing throughout the whole movie was the violence that Tarantino's movies are so known for, his biggest signature on cinema is the bloody violence in the films that made him famous and so for a two and a half hours of film I was hoping for a little violence. But then came the final scene, where me and all viewers were afraid of what was yet to come: the murder at Sharon Tate's house that shook America with fear. I was preparing myself only to discover the twist at the ending: a bunch of hippies getting their asses kicked by Dalton, Booth and Brandy the dog, not to mention the flamethrower from \"the 14 fists of Mcclusky\". A spectacular ending twist and hell of a bloody scene just like Tarantino can do. Remember when he changed history in \"Inglorious Basterds\" and killed Hitler? Well, he changed history again. Overall this has to be one of the finest movies he has ever directed. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood doesn't sit at the top with the rest of Tarantino's masterpieces but is at its own level of greatness.", "A misunderstanding": "Tarantino made us love the protagonists. Rick, Cliff and Sharon. We loved them and we were well aware that this will not end well. So we suffefed some kind of anded during must of the movie.\nBut Tarantino at the end gives us a gift, he saved them all. And we loved it.\nHow many things went wrong in our life?\nNo this time. Thank. I wish I could change the missfortunes of my life. But not this time\nThank", "No Substance": "All big names and no substance at all. Much time spent on creating the 70s environment with perfect backgrounds but the story hardly moves . Surprised to see such high rating for this movie. Overall disappointing.", "Patience is rewarded": "It's true. This movie has a very slow build, but build it does!\nIn some ways a slow build is what is missing from so many other movies. It allows for optimal character development.\nThe cinematography is amazing and Pitt, DiCaprio and Robbie truly kick ass in this movie - not to mention Pitts dog who is probably my favorite character!\nWhen the ending comes - it slams you in the face and it's amazing!\nI really love the idea of what if they knocked on the other door?", "Allen Key": "No doubt all the Mark Kermode pseud-alikes out there have already genuflected in King's New Clothes outlets nationwide and one opinion more or less will not make a whit or a jot of difference. This entry is very much in the style of the early Woody Allen movies - three or four reasonable set pieces punctuating acres of ennui. Okay, Tarentino knows a fair amount about Hollywood movies. So do I but I don't feel the need to flaunt this and even if I did who is gonna give a big rat's ass given that no one is actually HYPING me and until the Mark Kermodes of this world learn to recognise wheat from chaff we'll be lumbered with mediocre stuff like this for the foreseeable future.", "Terintinos best work": "I know this movie isn't for all, but it is for me. If like amazing performances, great story and amazing characters this movie is for you. The first half is slow and sets the scene with many holes to be filled with important information. Terintino fills these holes wonderfully as we move to the end of the movie, stopping for one of the greatest performances I've ever seen by decaprio. The ending is shocking and uses the information we used to fill in those holes to be much more satisfying.", "What a waste": "Please save your money !! Load of crap. Save 2h 41m of your precious day.\nNo story.", "Tarentino with another miss": "It's garbage like most of his other films. I don't know why I keep seeing tarentino movies when they come out. It's pretty much an ODE to the good ol days of Harvey Weinstein behavior.I'm always ALWAYS disappointed. This was a disappointed dumpster fire with a great cast.", "Nice Ride": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood got some fine cinematography, music and acting are excellent (one could dare to say like always if Mr. Tarantino is involved), and there are some beautiful moments, well composed scenes. Also the climax, the change of historical events is fun and got some real blood business a la Tarantino done, which is just fine. A good trip, that may not work for all fine but - see and decide for yourself. I like it.", "Tarantino brings on his A-game": "This is without a doubt one of the very best and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. I feel like the quality and finesse of Tarantino's film \u00abdiscography\u00bb have been building up to this true masterpiece of a cinematic ode to the glamorous Hollywood of the late 60's. Never have I witnessed a better duo than Pitt and DiCaprio as they (finally) are united for the very first time. Although Leonardo (seemingly) bears the leading role of the movie Brad's character weighs in as the one to watch. His strong physical presence on-screen is hard to miss and really shows off his ability to make the most of a \u00absilent\u00bb sidekick to Leonardos ace spot. Don't get me wrong - Rick Dalton (Leo) is portrayed as an interesting character but the lights are all on stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt). Nevertheless - Rick Daltons (Leo's) transition from a mediocre actor, on a downward spiral, to a true master of the arts in one of the scenes puts Leo right back in the game amongst the very best in the industry. Perfection without compromise. Margot Robbie plays a lovely Sharon Tate which in herself stands out as a true symbol of the Nordic-infused beauty of the same era. The visual look and feel of the movie is nothing short of perfect and I believe that a true 35mm screening of the film would be a real climax for true fans of the art. The directing, writing, onscreen cast, dialog, cinematography, costume and production design, film editing and adopted/original screenplay are just some of the categories to be expected as real considerations for future award ceremonies.", "No Story ! Time waisting.": "Do not watch that money time waisting movie, no storyline, no action, nothing to wait for, just 2 and half hours of annoying scenes.", "Inglorious": "Another self indulgent piece that breaks all the unwritten rules...without a good reason to do so.An all star cast assembled to perform in a a bunch of set pieces in what appears to be a slow chaotic plot.+3 for the happy ending and hippies dying.If others enjoy it, so be it. I never want to understand.", "One of the best movies of this decade!": "It is a shame that some people dislike this movie! This movie is indeed slow, but that is not a bad thing! I enjoyed every second of it and Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie give such incredible, captivating performances. Many people have found this boring because they are looking too hard for conflict and drama in the story like other movies. This movie, like most of Tarantino's movies, doesn't follow an orthodox formula. The film is character-based and we follow the lives of our three main characters, rather than follow one simple story.", "You need to be aware of history !!!": "People are going to see this without being aware of who Sharon Tate or The Manson Family were and then reporting there's no plot. When you know this history you realise precisely what the plot is and understand the film's title.", "Wonderful": "Really beautiful film with wonderful actors and with a very high level of acting. The plot is very beautiful and however it is clearly divided into two parts: one a little obvious at the beginning and then going crazy at the end becoming very unexpected.", "Not Tarantino's Best Work": "I mean, it was okay for what it was, but I really felt like what it was was an excuse for Quentin Tarantino to gush over 60's nostalgia, while also giving his good friend and convicted rapist Roman Polanski some sort of cathartic revenge on the people that killed his wife and unborn child by making some alternate reality where their fictional next door neighbours Rick Dalton and his stunt double brutally kill the Manson family members, because for some reason they decide to go into Rick's house instead.I really don't have much else to say. It's technically great, as always. It was a bit long and very loose in the plot department, and it feels like the ending with the Manson family was tacked on at the end, because it didn't really mesh with the rest of the story at all. The dialogue was fun, there were quite a few comedy moments that got a chuckle out of me. But it wasn't good. It's not Django Unchained, or Inglourious Basterds, or Kill Bill. I'm not big into Tarantino, I haven't seen all of his movies, but I respect his role in Hollywood, and I appreciate that he's one of the few working auteurs in the modern industry, but this film felt off to me.Also, this isn't a comment on the film itself, but more of meta commentary, but I find it VERY interesting how, according to Wikipedia, this is Tarantino's first feature film in years made without Harvey Weinstein producing, and for some reason, Tarantino decided to make a movie where another rapist in the form of Roman Polanski has a small but significant role in the story (and doesn't make any commentary on his character). This is also curious, as Tarantino is on record for having defended the actions of Polanski. Actions that, remind you, Polanski was CONVICTED for and fled from. I'm just saying, if some allegations are made against Tarantino, I would not be surprised at this point.", "This movie deserves way more than 10.": "This cannot be the review I want to give without the dreaded spoiler. But I do want to praise this film and the perfecto direction by the brilliant Tarantino. I'm sixty-five years old and was fourteen in 1969 and remember every dreadful moment. I sat through this movie without stopping it once and that is a rare thing for this old dude. The dreadful anticipation that many viewers my age experience when we watch films about Manson and his band of ghouls is what makes this film, in its totality, work like magic. And I don't want to leave out Brad Pitt and Leonardo because they were perfect too.", "Too much feet": "I clearly don't like feet as much as Quentin Tarantino, sorry", "Don't disrespect Bruce Lee with mockery": "Watching this movie was a typical Quentin Tarantino type film, excellent across the board until the moment they made a mockery and dishonor the name of Bruce Lee. At that point I actually walked out of the movie and this was only the third time I've ever done this in my lifetime. Bruce Lee like Fred Rogers and other great childhood Heroes should be honored and not disrespected. I'm very disappointed with what I saw and it could have been done a lot better \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u017d\u00f0\u0178\u2018\u017d", "awful": "I honestly don't know what everyone is raving about. Sure there were a couple of funny parts at the end... after a loooong 2.5 hrs of nothing. They made it look just like it did in 1969, but really who cares? Watch a movie filmed back then if you want nostalgia and it will actually be good. The acting was well done, but the story sucked so bad that the acting didn't matter. I usually love Quentin Tarantino movies but this was absolutely awful.", "HIstorical revisionism isn't usually this entertaining": "Didn't really know what to expect besides the (unbelievable) cast and the obvious love for the time period, but \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" turned out to be higher-end QT for me. This is much more in line with \"Jackie Brown\" than his other plot-driven films, and that breezy feeling suits the film to a T.Case in point: an unusual amount of screentime is devoted to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) slipping into a theater and watching herself on the big screen in \"The Wrecking Crew\", beaming at the audience's laughter. This is nothing less than a celebration of Tate's legacy (and loss); the camera loves Robbie and so do we. The sweetness in this scene is refreshing.It's also one of Tarantino's funniest, with much of the humor derived from the characters' disdain for hippies. Yes, Sharon Tate a character in this and yes, the third act goes down on that fateful night . . . but history plays out differently, with brutal and hysterical results.I loved this movie. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb, the period is a engaging sandbox, and this is a highlight of Summer 2019.", "Great cast, production, and style but honestly incredibly boring": "Really big QT fan but if you are expecting greatness along the lines of Django or Inglorious Bastards you will be hugely disappointed. I think QT really overthink this, or tried to be too cute/brilliant. I gave it a 5 solely for the work and production that went into it. I would in 100% honesty give the story/plot a 2 star. Read up on the more negative reviews. They basically all say the same thing, and they are right. I'm not sure they glowing reviews are real.This movie had an super-ultra all-star cast. Probably had 15+ famous actors that made appearances throughout the film. The cinematography, production, and look/feel were absolutely great but honestly the storyline/plot was mostly irrelevant, nonexistent, and frankly pointless. Add that to 2hr 45min and I can honestly say I couldn't wait for it to be over. I had no idea what the story was about or what the goal was. Most of the scenes were 2-3 minutes too long. An over abundance of constant rambling and irrelevant dialog. From the 2hr mark on some in the theater like myself would groan when scenes would just draaaaag on and and on and on. Even my girlfriend who is never as critical as myself and can sit through bland movies/tv shows without a problem even said halfway through \"are you bored too? I don't understand the point\". If she would say that, believe me there is something to it.Enjoy at your own risk.", "Interesting story, great dialog, excellent character development": "I'm a fan of Tarantino's movies starting with Pulp Fiction.

Highly recommended.", "So incredibly dumb": "What garbage... pointless garbage ...I started writing this while there was still 10 mins left to go in the film. I thought could make some intelligent commentary but the ending was so incredibly, ridiculously moronic, I have almost nothing to say. I started with three stars but I am taking it down to one .Let me say this: Sharon Tate wasn't such an dimwit idiot and Manson's girls were nowhere near that hot. They were mediocre by design so that they could be more easily manipulated. Tex Watson on the other hand was borderline special needs. And nobody thought or talked like that in the 60s. What a waste of time and talent. I thought the same about the Hateful Eight but this was worse. Unlike the Hateful Eight, I was able to force myself to finish this one... for what however, for what?Terrible this movie, just terrible...", "Try to stay awake": "I can't believe I lost 2 hours 45 minutes of my life sitting through this abysmal drivel. Firstly :THERE IS NO PLOT ! I sat there endlessly wondering when an actual storyline might begin but alas all that's on show here is the usual Tarantino male posturing and espousing over elaborate nonsensical dialogue that the moronic audience lapped up like spoon fed babies.\nIt culminated in five minutes of ultra violence ( mostly against women) and I was still none the wiser. So Sharon Tate was never actually murdered because Brad and Leo saved the day. That's literally what it's about but you have to fidget for the best part of three hours to find that out.

While Margot Robbie is third billed, it feels like she has about 10min screen time and is almost pointless to the story.It's good to watch DiCaprio and Pitt together and there's a natural ease and confidence to all their scenes. The problem is that half the film is just Pitt driving around and DiCaprio acting on a set. There are plenty of nods to the late 60s - Playboy Mansion, drive-ins, the fashion, dozens of film posters, smoking in almost every scene, snippets of songs - but overall, it doesn't really come across as nostalgic, just gimmicky. Might be more impactful if you lived through it.Plenty of cameos/small roles - Pacino, Hirsch, Olyphant, Dern, Dunham - but none of significance. There's Roman Polanski (Zawierucha), Charles Manson (Herriman) and Bruce Lee (Moh), but all have minimal screen time - except Lee, who's portrayed as an idiot for some reason. It's basically 2 hours 20min of nice cinematography - although too many shots of peoples shoes as they're walking - and then a hyperviolent/crazy final 20min which half links some of the film together.

There are so many things wrong with this film.It takes forever for the story (if you can call it that) to get going and the first half of the film mostly consists of set-pieces that Tarantino wanted to include so desperately that he apparently didn't care that they were unrelated. They resemble a scrapbook of scenes that Tarantino never tried to connect into a coherent story.Like all of Tarantino's recent films, it is far too long with drawn out or superfluous scenes and the characters of Bruce Lee, George Spahn, Randy (Kurt Russell), his wife, Janet and Marvin Schwarz were just unnecessary, irrelevant and added nothing to the film. In all, an hour could easily be cut from the film.These issues on their own are enough to seriously weaken any film but the biggest problem I had by far was with the ending where Tarantino changes history (again) and shamefully twists one of the most horrific and infamous mass murders of the last century into a climax of over-the-top slapstick gore that is played for laughs.I was appalled that such a tragic event could be trivialised and treated in such a disgusting way and it beggars belief that Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie agreed to be in this film after reading the script.Shame on them for doing so.", "Tarantino tears 1969 a new one ..!!": "Simply magic !

Tarantino does not miss a beat .Pitt and DiCaprio and the soundtrack are of Tarantino's best ...Buy a pack of Green Apples ...... you'll be glad you did........", "The master delivers yet again": "You wonder how the same individual can search through history for stories, cast some of the best actors on the planet for these stories, and twist the ending into something so delightfully sublime that you forget what actually happened and how large of an atrocity is being replicated for the audience. Quentin does it again with this one. From the first word of the script until the end, this one will engage any fan of Tarantino's and have them salivating to see what the ending brings for each character. Al Pacino might have had the weakest acting in this movie, which is just astonishing; however, it seems as though it is all a part of Quentin's master plan to keep his audience guessing what might be coming for and from his characters throughout the entire film. Keep em coming... Because everyone is watching...", "Once Upon A Time in Boredwood": "Worst Tarantino movie ever. No plot. No character development. No meaning. No point. This movie was overhyped and I want my money back. Why have Margot Robbie in this movie if she's not going to say anything for 3 hours? Seems pointless.

I saw Pulp fiction in the theater while in high school. I left confused and amazed at the same time. It took me a few years to fully grasp how amazing it was, and by college my apartment wall had your stereotypical Resevoir Dogs poster.I'm not a QT fan boy. I don't like all of his work, all of his scenes, etc. I suspect that most of the haters of this movie are craving the intense dialogue of Pulp Fiction or the fight scenes from Kill Bill Volume I.Honestly, I loved everything about this movie. Particularly, the top notch acting by everyone (I mean everyone). Leo playing Dalton - acting a scene, and forgetting his lines, acting a cut, acting a second take (all in one take) was amazing. The little girl taking a revolver to the head and getting tossed! We will certainly see more of her. Cliff against Bruce? That was fantastic and funny! It left me wanting to know so much more about the character Cliff, and what QT (the Kung Fu fan) thinks of Bruce Lee. The true star was Randy, a dog that everyone loves and more importantly respects. Randy makes you want to own an American bulldog.The characters were great, the acting was great. Every little clip that was recreated and included the same level of visual noise that you see on old footage. The music on the TV shows, the credits, it was all so-very-spot-on. I didn't grow up tuning the rabbit ears to catch shows like these, but they were a summer time staple for me watching re-runs between ITT technical college commercials. The branding of the dog food is stuck in my brain, just like I will never forget the tailgate on the Wagon or story of Zed's chopper.I greatly appreciated the attention to detail. I started this movie at 10PM at home, with a bad cold, and there was need to push through it. I was happy before the big ending started, and I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.", "DELICIOUS": "I'll start by saying that I'm a true Tarantino fangirl. I even have a Hanzo tattoo. Even so, a couple of his movies have left me feeling out of sorts, not because of the campy violence, but because of certain depictions of cruelty. I don't like mean. So, along comes 'HOLLYWOOD' and I know very well that if ever a story had cause to be mean as hell, it's this one. Still, I was stupid excited, as I am before every new Tarantino flick. As is my habit, I avoided all trailers and commercials; I wanted to be surprised, even though I was anxious about how Quentin would handle the tragic ending (don't worry - no spoilers in this review!).As we all know, QT's ego is the size of a planet, so I was concerned that he might botch this heart-breaking historic tale. What if he made light of a very real tragedy? What if he turned a sobering true crime into a cartoon? I mentally and emotionally prepared myself for the potentiality of an epic disappointment. But I needn't have worried. Thank you, Quentin.It's difficult to write about this film without pointing out every. lovely. thing. The streets, the cars, the marquees, the clothes, even the dirt, as a tire rolls to a stop. Chapped lips. Scars. The texture of hair as it moves on the breeze. Dirty feet. The plink of a maraschino cherry in a cocktail. How does QT do it? It's beautiful, this movie. He works his magic with the actors, too. They are transcendent (who is this fascinating man and what has he done with the real Brad Pitt?). In a word, this movie is.. MATURE. Quentin is finally growing up.The film is a meal. Some have described the pace as boring, but I would describe it as delicious. The story takes its sweet-ass time to simmer, then invites the audience to savor every bite, to relish each complex flavor. After seeing it, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. Bits of dialogue and snapshot images kept floating through my mind, as if they were distant memories from my own life.. maybe because I was born in '65 and the sounds and images from that era so easily transported me back to my childhood. No, it was more than that.. there was a FEELING.. it was a sense memory, a thing indescribable.Remember when you were a kid, when 'going to the movies' was magical? The smell of the theater, the strangers in the surrounding seats, that feeling of excitement about the whole experience. It was like that. I haven't felt that way about a movie since I was a kid. God, it was GREAT. What a ride! Two weeks later, I went back to see it again and it was even better, because I knew what to expect and I wasn't distracted by my own anxiety. Instead, I was able to completely suspend my disbelief and in so doing, I caught a million beautiful details that I'd missed the first time. I'm going back again, before it leaves the theater.", "It's an extremely boring movie": "For the first time in my life I was unable to look at a movie until its end, and after 40 minutes I left the theater. It's the worst film of Tarantino!", "boring, long, half written trash...don't waste your time or money.": "Boring and long..It was a half written and half formed idea that was given a bucket of cash and great actors and then dumped out the backside of a writer/director that has run out of ideas. .And the worst part of all it that the \"director/writer\" takes cheap shots at Bruce Lee, a man that is dead and can not defend himself.But in the end, It is just a bad movie... ..characters and introduced and never explored.... Nothing is explained in any detail; why did this person start drinking, did this character kill his wife, why are the two main characters so attached to each other, etc.... It was like the director and the writer never met but we know that isn't the case because they are the same person. And what is this movie about? It wasn't about the Tate murder or the Manson family, it wasn't really about a washed up actor, it wasn't really about a aging stunt man..it wasn't really a nostalgia movie either ....I don't need an hour of Brad pit driving around LA for nostalgia. ... if you want to see a well written and directed historically accurate. movie then watch Casino ... You can have nostalgia and advance the story.", "Yet Another Tarantino Masterpiece...": "Clearly, this film is marmite. I went into the cinema having read lots of negative reviews, so my expectations were low - but I'm dumbfounded as to how anyone could call it \"boring\" or \"pointless\". Yes, it's a slow burner, but the point of the film is to toy with our expectations. We all know that Sharon Tate was murdered by the Mansons, and we're waiting, in growing dread, as the minutes tick closer and closer to the end credits. We know what's coming, we know how this story ends. But this is a Tarantino movie, and the twist he provides is cinematic genius. Bursts of dark comedy help break the building tension, and the character development seen in the lead roles is masterful. The acting was outstanding, arguably DiCaprio's best performance to date. Cinematography was gorgeous, soundtrack authentic. For me at least, the 2 hours 41 minutes flew by, and I'll likely go back to see it on the big screen again just to appreciate anything I missed during my first viewing.", "heart beat rised": "Last 20 min was so nice.I can,t able to think what going to happen.But climax was big voilence and tarantino proved it.

If I had spent full price to watch this drivel in a theatre I'd be furious. Nearly three hours of rambling, unfocused, self-indulgent nonsense despite excellent performances by Pitt and DiCaprio.", "Tarantino did it again!!!!": "What an amazing movie! Brings back all that pulp fiction vibe, and all those regular Quentin's moves! The re-adaptation of the Tate's muder is genius, when you expect that something would happened, Tarantino changes into another line that could have happened. Amazing!!!

Even if the duration of the movie is so long, there is no unnecessary and boring scene.\nThe casting is so powerful (especially with Al Pacino). Leonardo Dicaprio is so brilliant in this movie as usual, his acting overtook Brad Pitt's. Brad Pitt also was good but Leonardo Dicaprio is the leading star! Besides, I adore Margot Robbie, I'd prefer to see her more in this movie but anyway she sparkled as Sharon Tate.\nI'd also like the unexpected ending which symbolized Tarantino!", "Most boring movie ever made": "I honnestly cant understand how you get 3 legeneds in a movie and make the most dull, boring and pointless movie ever. I would prefered to watch 3 hrs of a normal chat between brad pit, leonardo decaprio and al.", "Very Awesome": "The ninth film from Quentin Tarantino, \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,\" follows the lives of several people involved with the film/tv industry of 1969 Los Angeles, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie in the lead roles. Quentin Tarantino is probably one of my favorite filmmakers of all time, and I have never been disappointed from a film of his. Naturally I was incredibly excited to see this film, and so far it is my most anticipated film to see of 2019. I was eager to see DiCaprio and Pitt co-starring in the forefront, and curious as to how Tarantino was going to handle Sharon Tate as a character in the film, who was portrayed by Margot Robbie. Yet again, Quentin Tarantino has made a wonderfully shot, intriguing, entertaining, and hilarious film, with such respect to a rather delicate subject. Probably the easiest point to hit on is the impeccable acting. DiCaprio should be nominated for an Oscar for his work, as he is absolutely breathtaking. Portraying an aging television actor, Rick Dalton, DiCaprio acts out multiple parts in his role, as you see him portray the different characters he takes on as a part of his profession, as well as Dalton himself, a complex character with prominent flaws and thoughts. The most impressive aspect of his performance was his shift in accent and dialect, as he has a bit of a speech impediment when talking regularly, while he is able to completely get rid of it when he is portraying a character. Brad Pitt, who plays Rick's stunt double Cliff Booth, is a much more simple man, seemingly, yet very intelligent and witty. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Pitt is amazing, and you can really feel the connection they have with one another. The ensemble cast that make up the rest of the characters are very good, and may get less credit for their work, just based on the divided up screen time, and sheer amount of extremely talented performances. I feel that there may be people who comment on the screen time of Sharon Tate, and how her character may not really have an arc, but the deeper you think about her character's meaning, the more I feel that she is portrayed exquisitely. Concerning the film's narrative, I felt very invested in how I should feel about certain characters, and this just makes the events that happen in the film even more impactful and emotional. Tarantino's dialogue is brilliant, as most of his films, and scenes are made even better with clever conversations between characters. The costume and production design are amazing, and throughout the film I was really curious about how they captured certain scenes. This film makes you feel like you are living in 1969, from the way people talk, to the the way they dress and dance, and the perfect 60's soundtrack, you feel like you are right there with the characters. Tarantino also crafts some very tension filled scenes, so much that I tensed up in my seat while watching them. Considering the thematic material in the film, I felt very content with how things were handled, and despite what some people might say about Tarantino and his films, he does have a true sense of morality. \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" explores friendship, but also talks about the influence someone can have on another person, and how much that can impact them. It also seemed to me that there were several motifs present, such as certain characters wearing sunglasses, and the privilege of driving, which attests to the freedom people were given by vehicles during that time, and how it represented status. Critics are divided right now over the film's ending, which was probably my favorite part of the film, and felt surreal and earned. Without spoiling anything, I truly feel that Tarantino has something to say about publicity, which is definitely not apparent at first, but seems to recur to me when I think about the film's ending. There is very little to criticize with this movie, and really what I found felt minuscule. The second act probably has about a ten minute section that may slightly drag, but it still very good and entertaining. While I loved the third act, I felt that the beginning of the third act was a bit inconsistent tonally. There was a several minute section that involved switching between different characters that I thought involved too much mood changing for such a short period. It would help also going into this film with just a little bit of background knowledge on the events surrounding Sharon Tate, as it will just enhance your experience. I absolutely loved \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,\" and I think this may be my favorite Tarantino film. This is definitely a film you should checkout, and it is good for a film like this to exist, as it pays homage to a great period of time in an extremely nostalgic way, yet has so much originality that it is like nothing I have ever seen before.", "It entertained my eyes, but not my brain.": "The good reviews are coming from people who like the amazing talent in the movie. The movie itself? If you like watching actors drive around in cars, this movie is for you. The movie plods along, the dialogue plods along. The action was jokey.", "Biggest disappointment of 2019": "As a fan of the works of Tarantino, this is definitely the worse movie in his filmography to be nominated/win anythingthey probably thought it was time for Brad Pitt to win something so gave him the awardRewatched Jackie Brown, Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained and i can't see why Tarantino fans are gushing over this", "DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME": "This movie was basically me waiting for something to make sense for almost 3 hours... SUCKS!!!", "Yawnsville......again!": "How long is Tarantino going to surf along on the success of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction?What a pile of undisciplined, inconsequential, self-indulgent nonsense.So long as studios give this bloke the money and zero restrictions, he'll be able to write and film endless scenes of thoughtless drivel punctuated with guest appearances from his Hollywood chums and foot fetish shots from his current favourite Hollywood starlets.It serves me right for not having learned my lesson from Death Proof, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight. Why use 2 minutes of storyline when 1000 minutes of pointless waffling will do?With every film he consigns himself even deeper into the most overrated director category.Quentin Tarantino: movies to fall asleep by.", "Kind of a disappointment": "The movie took too long.. I was bored at some point. Really loved the role of Brad tho!!", "A great Tarantino signature !": "I can see that if you are not very used to watch movies for the acting, directing and powerful scenes overall you might struggle to find a narrative here and really enjoy this adventure. You need to relax and enjoy a sweet ride through Hollywood 1969. Enjoy very typical Tarantino unusual scenes and lines and also very fine acting. In the end you need to realise that it was just a story of the way those times were, how the industry was, how actors were behaving, events related to those years. A sweet glance back in time ! Fantastic !", "OMG WTF QT": "Don't know what to write... Sitting in the cinema right now and rather write this review than watch this sh.... Give your money to charity instead. What a massive waste of money and time.", "Tarantino at his most misunderstood": "This movie is absolutely not for everyone, and a lot of people regard it as plain boring. I, on the other hand, found it intriguing and heart warming at times. The story follows a has-been actor, Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), struggling for a comeback at the dawn of New Hollywood. His stunt double, Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt), follows his peer but manages his time fixing stuff at Rick's house. The entire film functions as 'a day in the life' of these characters - which include the late Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie). As Rick sees his shot at making a comeback by starring in spaghetti westerns on the other side of the globe, he returns to Hollywood with a slightly changed mindset, beset on his inevitable downfall. He and Cliff kicks back and accepts their fate, which coincidentally occurs on the same night of the Manson murders - and Rick is the next door neighbor of Tate. After discovering that Rick Dalton lives next to Tate, history takes a slight shift as the Manson family decides upon killing Rick because he \"taught them how to kill\" with his violent TV westerns of the 50s - a snarky comment on the critique of Tarantino's own films. Cliff and Dalton quickly dispatches of the Manson members in a cathartic, Tarantino-esque way, and Dalton is invited by Tate to her house - a symbol of his return to Hollywood. 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' finds Tarantino contemplating the tumultuous era and does so in a character study. Rick Dalton's feelings of loss of pride and meaning is thoroughly felt, and his moments of glory sparks an enormous joy in the audience. I believe 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' to be one of Tarantino's best, but absolutely his most misunderstood film.", "Nothing": "150 Minutes nothing happening. Waste time for many people.", "This is a good movie.": "This is a very good movie. 7.7 is overrating. Did it just get that because Questin Tarantino made it. But just the same. It is a good movie. It is better then Wolves at the door. It does have good acting. It also has a good story line.", "OUATIH - LAST REVIEW (after more than 10 screenings)": "How many times can you watch OUATIH in a month? I've seen enough, but not it all. Next step: DVD / Blu-Ray or serialized - what comes first.\n(Remark: I usually don't watch any movie so many times in such a short time span. In fact, I don't remember having watched any movie before so frequently in the first month. But then again, QT himself stated, that he watched The Wrecking Crew 6 times... - I have seen all the films with Sharon Tate \"only\" once, recently (even \"12+1\" in Italian), and The Fearsome Vampire Killers once before, long ago.)\nMan...the issue is, it is getting difficult to endure the length of the movie, after so many screenings, since sooner or later only certain scenes remain interesting, some scenes you hardly await again, but some scenes would be better to skip.\nLet's look at it from such perspective. ULTIMATE SPOILERS follow.\nThe scenes worth omitting: some Bounty Law scenes, the (most part of) Schwartz scene, the dog feeding scene, the Bruce Lee scene (Zo\u00c3\u00ab Bell and Kurt Russel part), the Spahn Ranch scene (the part in the building), a part of the final showdown scene (the first part). The scenes, that can be watched without further comment: the first scene at Frank & Russo's, the scene at Playboy mansion, the scene with Sharon at the cinema, the scene of return from Italy, the final-final scene. And, the scenes that keep getting better and better: the parking lot scene (\"It's official ol' buddy, I'm a has-been...\"), the evening rehearsal-and-drinking at the poolside, the first scene with Sam Wannamaker, the scene with the little girl (about Easy Breezy), Rick's scene in the trailer, the kidnapping-ransom scene (with Julia Butters and Luke Perry), the watching of FBI and drinking, the second Schwartz scene, the homecoming scene (Out of Time), and the Red Apple commercial. As you can see, the scenes solely with Brad get \"too heavy\", the scenes with Margot can be viewed again, however all the Leonardo's emotional scenes get better and better each time. So, who is the better actor? In fact, who is (by far) the best actor in this movie? QT knows this, of course. He may not be a good actor himself (especially in the interviews), but he can spot, engage, and develop a talent, to its maximum potential. This time, he \"nailed\" it with Leonardo DiCaprio (100%), there are other memorable roles as well, but only 1 Oscar-worthy. In fact, it seems to me that as much as QT has \"matured\" as a writer & director, the same can be said for Leonardo. Some actors, on the other hand, are just playing themselves (that is they're as bad) - some of these are QT's friends, so, yeah, it can be understood.\n(Side note to detail-aware public, to ease the tension: I have spotted 2 inconsistencies in the movie. One, the way Timothy Olyphant's character shoots the businessman (around the back) - I believe he was using the Colt Peacemaker - a single-action revolver, so it is quite impossible to fire it around the back single-handedly (or else such revolver did not exist in 1869). Second, on Cielo Drive, close to Rick's house, there are some cars parked on the side of the road: The Jaguar E-type is always parked in the same way in the exact same place - in February, and in August.)\nI have enjoyed the movie for too many times already, as pointed out above. Why's that? Some people (I believe the same ones all over again) claim that they have wasted nearly 3 hours of their life for this movie. If that is so, then I have \"wasted\" more than 30 hours of my life within a month. Or, do I really have anything better to do these days, than to repeatedly watch OUATIH? There are several hundred critic reviews of this movie on the 'net. This site (and others like it) feature about 3000 users' reviews. It looks like the most reviewed movie this year. All has been already said. There is no use to repeat the synopsis. I see no purpose to repeat the praise, and absolutely no sense in any negative \"complaint\". All the poison has already been spilled all over the 'net, thankfully it is visible from afar, so it is quite easily avoidable. It looks like when people have nothing constructive to say, they just engage in over-the-top \"spitting tournament\". No need for it. OUATIH is a work of art. It is a complex narrative, that requires all the elements, it contains, in order to function. In the first part of this review, I've illustrated what happens after more than 10 viewings, however, I would not have changed anything in the whole movie, anyway. The question that remains unanswered for the moment is, whether it (OUATIH) will start a life of its own. Or, better, when?\nI have a few more impressions to share. Restitution of Sharon's life. I have found the parallel on the 'net, and it is again by David Lynch. The creation of parallel universe in Twin Peaks the Return, in which Laura Palmer lives. Italy. There is something inherently autobiographic with the whole Italian westerns theme, the trip to Rome, the loop with Francesca, the meaning of friendship (bromance) vs. marriage. This story has not been completed, as QT's own story goes on. Cliff has a dog, a pit-bull terrier. Himself he is Rick's pit-bull. Not less loyal, not more intelligent. Innocence lost-and-found. I have come full circle. At first, I considered the innocence lost, as it happened IRL. But it didn't. Cliff is not an innocent, neither is anybody he associates with, this way or another. Brad \"nails\" the part, but can he do better? Neither of Sharon's companions (including her husband) is innocent. But she is, that is all Sharons (the real Sharon, the meta-Sharon, and the hybrid Sharon). Margot is naivety incarnate. Sharon was not. And guess what: Rick is an innocent (obviously this includes Leonardo). Whatever he thinks and does, whatever his doubts, depressions, and highlights - he remains true to himself and some \"other\" ideal. He is a high romantic, the kind that has died out. At the end, the two Innocents come together.", "Happily ever after...": "2019 is the year I will remember by this movie.\nInstead comparing this movie with the others, rating should be represent of feelings and emotions that this movie starts in you.\nThank you Tarantino!", "Pretentious rubbish": "Boring.

It was one of the best movies I've seen in years and I can't think of another Tarantino movie that is better made.I was compelled to write a review because I'm so confused by the 1 start reviews here.This movie was an experience, an experience for people that love movies (and have not stunted their attention span with too much media). Everything in it was well earned. The surprise and reversal of expectations had to be crafted with great effort: a lesser director would have made this turn off narrative non sensical.If you follow Tarantino through this story, he will give you a level of catharsis and enjoyment that few movies every have. The Shawshank redemption comes to mind for me as far as catharsis goes, but these are obviously much different movies.Movies are stories. If you like great stories, this is one of them. But you have to sit down and listen and see every word and frame.", "Disappointing from Tarrantino": "Just a lot of nostalgia about LA and the film industry.

Leo was the star, and he was phenomenal but Brad Pitt was probably my favorite character. It's creative, snarky, hilarious, real and just Quinton Tarantino. Understanding the historical context in which this movie takes place is important in order to fully appreciate this masterpiece. I've seen negative reviews about the lack of plot, but that is far from it. The plot is in the characters themselves. The dialogue, the acting, the raw emotion and the feeling of Leo's deteriorating acting career and much more. I promise you in a few years this will be deemed a classic.", "such a dissappointment": "Wasted opportunity - I only expect entertainment from Tarantino and was not entertained...", "when a great artist becomes even better": "The best tarantino's Film so far...deeply touching funny and violent with a reason (if is a reason for violence)personal and emotional.... great Leo , bratt and margott...there shining like stars...a mature true artist in his best... don't miss it...great soundtrack like always...", "Quintessential Quentin": "I am a firm believer in Quentin Tarantino...that's it, he's one of the most creative writers/directors in Hollywood. This movie is clearly an ode to his childhood and you can see it in the movie and it's continuity. Every movie needs a build up, just this took a little longer, but it was worth the wait at the end.

However, the final fight scene in the last 30 minutes of the movie is quintessential Tarantino (so at least watch that). Overall, the cast is AMAZING, the acting is AMAZING, but the plot sucks.I still don't understand Margot Robbie and Emile Hirsch's role in the film. I'm sure there is a deeper meaning to the film; however, I watch movies to be entertained and I was severely disappointed. Do yourself a favor and just watch the last 30-45 minutes.", "No 'ifs' or 'buts' about it - it's a masterpiece": "Almost 3hrs of pure luxury on your ears, eyes and brain. What more could anyone want?Tarantino tells a risky, enthralling, involved and deeply nuanced story of an actor facing personal struggles with bipolar disorder, self-medication, his career, and a possible future without the companionship of his stunt double and close friend.The tale advances adjacent to a what-might-have-been version of an notorious incident in history. Tarantino tells it in a style and richness of detail that surpasses all he's done before.It left me moved, gobsmacked, and desperately wanting to watch it again.Oh! Also includes best use of a tin of dog food in cinema history 10/10", "Snooze fest!": "Awful job by a great talent! Not engaging in the least. Poorly executed and disjointed, with no plot.

Nothing was happening, no conflict, no tension, no emotion, just good acting, and classic Quentin cinematography but this lasted for 2 hours which felt like weeks in the theater.\nThe atmosphere was amazing and really captured the vibe.Movies don't always have to be exciting but no information was being given so I didn't see the point in anything. I was patient for the first hour of the movie but when nothing was happening, I was confused.I thought i had accidentally watch a documentary of some actor in the '50s. The plot reminded me of the movie 'Lost in Translation' but contrary to that movie, it was way more slow-paced and just felt a useless amount of screen time. The acting was amazing and enjoyable but the characters were flat, not motives, not development what so ever. It didn't feel like a Quentatino story.The end part of the movie was way more exciting but it doesn't excuse for all the hours that were not. If it wasn't for Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt's acting, I would have fallen asleep way earlier. I felt like Margot Robbie was the most useless character, she said less than 10 words in this movie.Anyways, don't watch this movie unless you really like 50s and 60 and old hollywood or are superfans of Leo and Brad, 6/10.", "The most boring movie I have ever seen": "Boring film honestly. The performances are great with very memorable lines, the cinematography is awesome, the music choices are perfection and it rewards multiple viewings but I literally took a shower during the 2nd act, sat back down, continued to watch and didn't feel like I missed anything. I honestly felt very indifferent to the movie and it left nothing to take with me after it finished. it felt like NOTHING!! The movie has almost no direction or narrative, it feels like it's stuck for it's entirety, I'm not saying that every shot has to mean something but almost every scene felt like it was doing nothing to move the story or it's characters forward, putting that aside, why include Manson and Sharon in this movie? Like if you're gonna have them do something with them because it has no other purpose other than to have the murders occur and changing real history because that's what Tarantino does it breaks my heart to say and feel this.. bc I'm a Tarantino fan. I have no idea what Tarantino was trying to say. This is one of those movies I'll never watch again.. A waste of an amazing cast .. Dragged for no reason .. the Bruce lee scene was so unnecessary..so sad he did that. I went into this movie knowing nothing, and I was constantly asking myself \"what is the plot?\" You have DiCaprio and Pitt in the same movie and make this movie no action no plot and just empty. Don't waste your money", "Tarrontino back at his best": "Simply brilliant Brad and Leo at there best it's an off the wall film Tarrontino does it again and the ending was fantastic \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u02dc", "Another 'Tarantinic' MASTERPIECE! \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u0152": "Outstanding depiction of the 'Actor Lifestyle' in late 60s Hollywood.Feel like writing much much more, but it's hard to do it without little spoilers... Just a note for those who pay attention to details: you won't be disappointed ;)", "One of the best movies ever made.": "People who rate this a 1 have no clue. Be relaxed and go see this movie on a good 4k hdr tv with good sound. Just sit back and enjoy the genius of the movie.", "The Hollywood I Remember": "This is the Hollywood I remember growing up in Southern California in the 50s and 60s. It's a panic of druggies, alcoholics, hippies, straights, gays, billboards, television, radio, music and film in a seemingly endless variety. It was probably one of the best times to ever be around the Hollywood scene. And then of course it all crashed as the times changed and everybody got sober again, got married, went back to school or returned to their boring jobs. No spoilers here but if you grew up in Southern California during this period of time you're gonna love this movie. There's a riotous twist in this crazy saga, one you'll have to experience for yourself. Quentin Tarantino at his very best!", "Amazing Cast, great cinematography": "I loved the chemistry of Pitt & DiCaprio. Here we have an entire cast of superstars. There is no clear story line it's all about amazing acting skills. I loved every bit of DiCaprio's acting. I also expected good acting of Pitt, cause when you think about Fight Club or Babel you do know he has some great roles. As soon as I knew the Charles Manson Story is involved in this movie I was excited how Tarantino brings that in this movie. To keep my review a little bit short. All I can say is that you should go to this movie if you like to see some great acting and have a Faible for that 60s Retro shot. In some parts of the movie it felt like it's getting stretched, but it's covered by the acting skills of DiCaprio & Pitt.The only negative point that really made me furious was how they showed up Bruce Lee as an arrogant and overconfident man. Real fans of Lee do know he was never that person in the movie. It's a disgraceful treatment against his legacy.", "Absolutely amazing": "This is amazing please watch it. Great performances, quotable dialogue, and a wonderful narrative. This is one of Tarantino's best.", "Not worth the time.": "In my opinion is probably the worst Tarantino movie. I'm sorry i spend the money on the ticket. I've lost 3 hours of my life for nothing .", "Pointless and self-indulgent with a few fun bits": "Pretty slow and meandering, leading to just about nothing.There are some fun scenes and a bits and pieces. It's all really just a bit random and forced though. If people are saying this is any kind of artistic masterpiece then that's emperor's new clothes.", "Really?!?": "It's a family movie about Terentino. But for every other one it's wasting time....", "Gave up after an hour.": "I have to keep reminding myself of the old adage, if it doesnt capture your imagination within the first 15 minutes then abandon it. Believe me that works most of the time. With two top actors in it from the start, I allowed it a longer leash, but gave up after an hour. Im from the sixties and enjoyed all that it had, a start, a middle and an end. This movie was like a broken record, just skipping back and forward, not going anywhere. Pity!!", "Not Tarantino' Best Work": "I had high hopes for this movie but the plot was loose and relaxed. The movie was filled to the brim with uneventful filler and violence felt misplaced. That's all I can say that's bad about it. The acting was great, the dialogue was great, the cinematography was excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio was amazing, Brad Pitt was funny and Margot Robbie was charming as usual. Its worth the watch but don't expect too much.", "Way too long and pointless": "Quentin Tarantino made an excellent 70 minute movie, and then realized it was too short, so he stretched it out to almost 3 hours with so many long and pointless scenes, that it detracts from what could have been a great tribute to one of the best eras of Hollywood. I only gave it 5 stars because the production and musical score save it.", "It's A Rarity. And A Treasure.": "You'll 'get it 'or you won't. A review won't help that really. If you don't , you'll think it VERY long and boring and without any plot or real purpose. And on a certain level you won't be wrong. As a 'modern' 'A' list film it lacks 'pace'. No review can change your mind. -added Aug 3--- And judging by the number of ratings that are 3 and less, some of YOU didn't 'get it' .At all.\nSo why bother ? For those who do 'get it' it might be that even more rare film that gets 'better' the more you see it. Because,there is no REAL plot. There's just two 'average joe' guys living their lives for a set period in a very defined era. Does get a little heated near the end, but even then it's the story of of town built upon fairy tale endings.\nI'm going to watch it again, to pick out as many details now as I can. Because as is often said, it's NOT the destination; It's the journey.Edit: I have watched it over again. It's a gem. I changed my rating from 9 to 10 because even those few tiny examples of 'too much detail', weren't out of place and I understood why they were there. It does get better the more you watch it. It stays the same of course but YOU watch it differently. The dread you might have felt because of the supposed subject is gone and you can just enjoy the scenery and the trip. VERY highly recommended.\nps. Just in case for anyone seriously checking this flic out. Those low reviews are just wrong as wrong can be. This movie is going to be Oscar nominated in MULTIPLE categories. It should win in many of them. Hollywood itself is saying so.\nJust GO.", "Sooooo boring movie": "The most boring movie ever seen. The scenario is too usual without any defined subject.", "Tarantino matches his best!!": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might start out a little tepid, but Tarantino's best in years picks up steam steadily and brings us along for a wild ride. Arguably the most beautiful homage to LA of old ever captured on film, the recreation of 1969 Hollywood is enough to take your breath away. Compounded by an incredible and diverse soundtrack, plus a solid cast led by DiCaprio's incredible Rick Dalton gives us one of the best movies to come out this decade and a guaranteed future classic.", "Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece": "Im a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, he is the reason I want to become a filmmaker. I was really looking forward to this film ever since it was announced and the wait was worth it. This is perhaps Tarantino's best film in my opinion it showed his craft at full force, and you can tell he put all he had into this film. Leo and brad are great together and have some of the best scenes in the film, espically brad who steals the show every time he is on screen. Margot is great as Sharon Tate, she protrays her as someone who is sweet and innocent. All The acting in the film was great. The film also looks beautiful espically when leo and brads characters are just driving the night roads of 1969. I feel like this film would divide audiences, if you love Tarantino work, and good films in general then you will love this. But if you're the type of guy who only likes movie with explosions every five seconds then maybe this isn't for you, this is a film for true film lovers.A great film with great acting from everyone, great soundtrack, and an explosive finale which I won't give away.\nOnce upon a time in Hollywood is true tribute to film and perhaps Tarantino's masterpiece", "I love Tarantino, but this was boring as hell.": "This has to be the least violent Tarantino film hes ever made. Theres probably less than 10 minutes of violence in the entire movie. The swearing is also toned down to an average movie. The acting was amazing, and so was the wardrobe and setting. Just so wildly out of character for a Tarantino film. I was so bored I was considering walking alot several times.", "What was the point of this movie?": "Very little point to this movie apart from showing off 60s decor. Waste of nearly 3 hours. One of the most boring films I think I've ever tried to sit through. Taranto ramblings.", "Ridiculously long for the minor story line(s)": "There were multiple story lines in here. Some of them went somewhere, others were just fluff and could easily have been left out. This turkey runs for 2 hours and 40 minutes. It could have easily had 45 minutes to an hour cut out and been more enjoyable, less boring and just generally a better offering. As it is, I was ready to stop it at 90 minutes but, when I looked, I had another 40 minutes to go. Then, right at the end, after 2+ hours of moderate boredom, all hell breaks loose for about 10 minutes and then it is all over. Don't want to spoil it for you. But be ready for something to FINALLY happen almost at the end. It was a very slow boil until then!I would not recommend this unless you are snowed in and don't expect to be dug out for a few days. There are many choices for entertainment and this is not one of them!", "Do you love Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Django, & The Hateful Eight? You will probably hate this.": "Boring, boring, and more boring. I absolutely love Pulp Fiction- I watched it 4 times at the theater alone. I have seen every Tarantino movie. I love some, and deeply enjoy most. I was straight up was bored to death during Once upon a time. I actually looked forward to taking a bathroom break, knowing full well I had zero chance of missing anything important or exciting. There is at least 45 solid minutes of no dialogue while Brad Pitt drives in circles in Hollywood....literally 45 minutes. It has two 3 minute action scenes via scenes from other movies shown inside this movie, and one 10 minute action scene as the finale, the other 2 1/2 hours of film is without consequence. Even the cameos are flat. You do see hundreds of vintage cars in the background and lots of neon store and bar signs. Do not waste your time or money.", "Great great great": "I really fricking loved this film! Outstanding visual shots great unexpected plot twist to spike enthusiasm ,and honestly the fact that it unravels \"slowly\" (according to critics) Is a way of the movie taking you with it, It felt personal..", "Depends on the viewer": "The acting is top notch and my gosh was Leo good. The skill it takes to play an actor who is actually acting in the film is unbelievably difficult and Leo made it look easy.The setting of 1960s Hollywood was amazing. They did a really good job of creating the atmosphere of that time and the music they paired with each scene was great.The film doesn't really have a plot there is no goal or antagonist to defeat it is very much a character driven movie but for me the characters and the performances were so unbelievably good it didn't matter that much. So depending on who is watching this they might be like me and not care as much or they might hate the fact that there isn't a real plot.The voiceovers at the end took away from the story telling and didn't fit with the rest because it took to long. They should have shortened that down and take the extra time they gained to go back to telling story the way it was earlier.Though it didn't bother my enjoyment of the movie it is a negative critically that it didn't have a plot. It hurts me to have to put it as a negative because it doesn't take away from the core of the movie but it does make certain parts seem strange and the middle of this movie is pretty much just one huge extremely well done character development scene.The movie overall is great. The performances given by the star studded cast are amazing and provide the already great characters another reason to love them.8.5/10.", "Worst Tarantino Film!": "I am a huge fan of Tarantino but this film lacks everything. It feels like you are waiting a long time for a slight build up for something only to be very disappointed. While watching the film I was over half of the way through the film and still didn't have any direction the film was going into, but like many others in the theatre we continued to watch hoping and begging for something to happen.Admittedly there're a few comical scenes in the film but these do not make up for the lack of direction the film has, I feel that QT didn't know whether to delve into the Charles Manson cult or the nostalgia of the films in the era. Margot Robbie's character seems to be only a nod to the Manson cult once again but her role bares no significance to the movie what so ever.I bare this as a warning if you want anything of the Quintin Tarantino films we all enjoy to watch, you will be waiting for the last 30minutes. I also feel for the great cast that has been assembled in this film it should have been a billboard breaker but I feel it will not.", "AAMAZING! so good dont listen to the negative reviews": "People who give this a bad review obviously are just trying to be contrary because this movie is spectacularly amazing\nengrossing the entire time\nand a crazy cool payoff climax when you finish yer like WEOAH SUPER GOOD.", "Just awesome!": "It was so cool to see QT create a masterpiece about Hollywood during hippie Hollywood in the 60s and the life of a actor trying to make a name for himself in Hollywood and to be noticed. Brad Pits character is a great friend to leo in the film and supports him whilst leo's character deals with reality and how it's hard to make it as a defined actor. whilst this the Manson family are planning a horrific murder event.", "The last part is the only exciting thing in the movie": "I'm guessing that it's a twist on the Charles Mason murders because the neighbors had the heiress of the coffee company and Sharon was pregnant and that describes the victims of Masons last mass murder and the movie was changing the outcome but that all happens in the last 20 min and everything else before that is just confusing and slow and doesn't really have a plot. Was excited because it won awards but now I'm confused why it did because it's not really anything special", "From a huge QT fan: this is a genuinely bad movie": "Some context: I'm a gigantic Tarantino fan. I haven't been to a movie theatre in years, probably because Tarantino hasn't released a movie to theatres in years. While this was in maybe its second week of release, I got my ticket and checked out the IMDb rating.It was 8.3.Immediately after it was over, I had trouble offering my thoughts to my companion. I ultimately settled on, \"I can't tell if this is just Tarantino's worst movie (which doesn't automatically make it bad) or a genuinely bad film in its own right.\"I've since realized that, two weeks in, the 8.3 was artificially inflated by the fact that most people who had seen it by then were fanboys. Anecdotally, I've had two conversations with friends who were relieved to finally hear someone describe the movie as bad. I'll actually paste from a text from the one that was most explicit:\"...yeah, I left the theater a little miffed at best. I've actually lied to people and told them I loved it, when I really didn't. At all. It was really bad. And it feels good to say that.\"Now that it's at 8.0, it is certainly moving in the right direction, but this would be at about a 5.0 with any other director's name attached to it.Again, I will be really excited to see his next movie. But this one was a bigger quality deviation from a usually-excellent director than Buster Skraggs was for the Coens.I wish I could be as declarative about the performances- at least one of them. But, while the pairing of DiCaprio and Pitt helps to make it really obvious how much more talented Pitt is, of the two. I can't say that DiCaprio's Performance was worse than the movie itself. But that should actually serve as an indication of how bad the movie was, more than anything else.TLDR; I actually don't believe the other reviewers here. It's hard for me to believe that many people liked this movie. My sense is they're motivated by fandom, not trusting their real opinion, and (justifiably) being worried they'll sound like the odd one out.", "A Movie Who's Third Act is Worth the Price of Admission": "This film is full of the Tarantino-isms you've come to expect. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio pair so well together in this movie, you'd think Rick and Cliff really did exist. Although her screen-time is negligible and only necessary for the setup of the third act, Margo Robbie gives a respectable performance as Sharon Tate. The combination of Robert Richardson and 70mm film is a visual delight as always. While the second act is a bit slow and misguided for a Tarantino film, the third is what you came for and boy does it satisfy.. The tension and suspense debt is paid in full plus some, in what is probably the funniest, and most violent finale to a film I've seen in a long time. Do yourself a service and watch this film.", "First review": "I have never written a review before. But I felt this one movie deserves one.\nI have seen all of Quentin Tarantino films and I loved them all. This one I would have to consider one of my favourites! The story and the acting were incredible. I was aware of the history and was concerned about what kind of movie I was going to see. Let's just say I was not looking forward the the end.\nAs the movie begins it focuses on brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprios Characters and what they were going through towards the end of the 1969s. With a brief introduction to Margo Robbies character of Sharon Tate....giving me that reminder of what will eventually come.I continue to watch the characters develop and get a sense of what it was like in Hollywood during that time. Just loving the interactions and the stories, really feeling for the characters in the movie.....essentially, it seemed to me like Tarantino was able to successfully convince me that I was watching a completely different movie than I I originally walked into.And then he flipped it back. I remember the exact scene where I realized what was going to happen and immediately became anxious.I won't give anything away but all I can say is I love this movie because I went in to it expecting an emotional response to it..... and got one..... but not the one I thought.", "Performances of their careers": "Once Upon a Time in ... Hollywood is the work of a middle-aged director, one who looks back by looking forward.\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt deliver the most emotionally vulnerable performances of their careers as soon-to-be has-beens in 1969 Hollywood.\nThis is Tarantino at his most vibrant, his most detailed, and his most stylish", "Undoubtful Masterpiece": "This movie is a complete masterpiece. Tarantino takes a step back from his usual blitzkrieg balls to the walls action and puts together a visual work of art. Leonardo DiCaprio effortlessly kills his role as an emotional and bipolar actor who is on the decline. Brad Pitt displays A-Lister acting as his no nonsense, go with the flow persona accompanies Leonardo DiCaprio as one of the finest movie duos ever. The chemistry between these 2 actors sets them far apart from any other movie duo and sets up the movie as a form of art.", "Great movie but": "If you hear Tarantino, or DiCaprio, or Brad Pitt, without further details, simply go watch that movie because guaranteed worthy. So what if you heard the 3 of them together..no brainer..No one beats Tarantino but Tarantino, an authentic crazy genius. Actors are talented limitless. Plot shatters into shrapnel then recombines into one blow or one bullet or even one word...that's the Tarantino mojo..the choice of background music & songs is beyond perfection. Camera work is also sky high good. Perhaps resemblence of that era didn't come so precise, but still another hit. Watch it or be sorry.", "Epic movie": "This movie is epic, one of the Tarantino's best. But you have to know background of some characters to understand story. Its not without reason called once upon a time... Absolutely amazing.", "The most boring move ever made .": "Not the worst movie ever, but the most boring.Over 2 hours only waiting waiting waiting waiting.I still fall a sleep almost when I think about this move.", "TARANTINO DOES IT AGAIN! (spoiler-free)": "I'll make this short and sweet.Brilliant team behind this movie in all aspects.\nGreat casting, Pitt and Dicaprio's chemistry is uncanny.\nMusic is amazing (California Dreaming cover playing while we see scenes of famous hollywood landmarks is a personal favorite of mine!)\nGenuine humor/comedy in parts of the movie\nBrilliant story, and screenwriting\nThe most accurate set/timepiece movie of all time, they nailed Hollywood in that era with all the aesthetics you could possibly perceive.\nTarantino's trademark scene that takes things to the next level and shocks you.", "Ridiculous": "Brad Pitt is a better than Bruce Lee! Lol... Bruce Lee is a warrior and a legend, nobody has a chance with him. Lost respect for you quentin tarantino.", "In a world where movies are made for everyone, QT does what he does best, and makes a masterpiece not everyone will appreciate.": "I have now seen this movie three times in theatres... and by god I may indulge again tomorrow night.\nThat to me is the very description of the crafted, honed, and mastered skill that QT has.First off let me say that this IS NOT a movie everyone will appreciate.\nI was reminded by this as I seen this the first time with a \"less appreciative\" relative of mine, then upon leaving the theatre he glanced at the poster next door and mumbled \"shoulda seen Hobbs and Shaw\". *I gasp*This movie shatters everything that makes the films that pour into the cinema. I truly believe it's QT spitting on what \"should\" be. \"Oh you think this scene feels uncomfortable? Well here! Oh this doesn't ring true to the real events? Who said it should?! Oh you're getting bored? WELL FLAMETHROWER.\nIt's NOT story driven (you ask me to tell you what the movie is about and I'm hard pressed to get that into one sentence), it's NOT making you feel stupid by finding ways to introduce characters and situations, every shot DOES NOT have a purpose, every scene DOES NOT lead to further the plot. ...And I love it. (More about that below)This movie to me is simply about life.\nIt does what movies I believe are forgetting they should do, it transports you to another time, another era, and by the last act, another reality.\nI can't believe after seeing the trailer I expected (well... with a QT movie I can't believe I foolishly set my expectations anywhere) a noir thriller about the Manson murders. When walking out of the theatre I realized Charles Manson has LITERALLY one scene!\nThis isn't a \"wooooow that was so cool when that happened\" type movie, it's a journey through relatively regular lives of a couple of people in an incredible era.\nIt's filled with subtle questions about the social construct we live in, fame, the duality of man, and yet still rings true to the QT movies of the past pulling out a scene that makes you sit up in your seat and go \"...what the living f+%# was that\".Onto the movie itself, it has terrific performances all around. Brad Pitt at the best I believe I've seen him in a long time, Leo does what Leo does he's a great actor. Robbie pulls off a Sharron Tate so ditsy, yet at the same time so kind hearted. Although I believe the REAL star of the show was a 12 *achem* I mean 8 year old girl who stole EVERY SECOND of the few scenes she was in.The dialogue? Crisp. Not the best we've seen from QT, but MORE then enough to remind why he's one of the very best. This isn't a short film, and it doesn't speed along to say the least, but with dialogue like this who needs it to?? I found myself wanting scenes to continue just to hear more back and forth, more witty comments, more punch lines that hang in the air as the conversation moves on.That all paired with BEAUTIFUL shots of the city that brought us anything playing in the local theatre, and a soundtrack. OHHH the soundtrack. From a driving at night shot of Brad Pitts \"Ramblin Gamblin Man\"(Bob Segar) to the ominous \"Out of Time\" wails of the Rolling Stones as Sharron Tate heads home for that fateful evening. If you're not into the vibe of the city the music will get you there quick.A film I truly am proud to say I witnessed released, and will indeed quench the thirst for a Tarantino movie till the 10th and final, and for years to come after.", "Maligned masterpiece": "Probably Quentin Tarantino's most restrained film in terms of pace and dialogue to date, making it feel like his most mature work to date. There are many of the Directors trademark conceits including the jumping narrative, the film within the film, the homages to much loved cultural inspirations. Especially for fans of the Hollywood period it was set in or the older folks like me who caught the end of it's output on TV growing up.\nThe dialogue and scripting is less frenetic and feels more naturalistic, far less contrived than that in many of his previous films. The pacing and narrative benefit greatly from this as the imagery and atmosphere come to the fore, the whole film as experience is a far more relaxing and absorbing than others which required fix attention.\nThe pastiche homages to TV show and film genres works brilliantly, and the scenes from the film within the film though brief they are very engaging. All the actors deliver superb performances, not an off note among them....the film delivers quite a few laughs, some touching and thrilling moments.\nSome critics seem to be looking for spurious reasons to negatively review the film including describing the performance of Margot Robbie's in the role Sharon Tate as just being fodder for the male gaze? ...such a slanted politically skewed take on a performance that was in fact quite touching and engaging, definitely the Heroine of the film.\nI think with time the positive opinion of this film as one Tarantino's finest will grow and grow.", "He's done it again!": "Tarantino has done it again! It's been a while since he's put anything out, but after seeing this movie...it was well worth the wait. If you are a Tarantino fan, I don't see how this film could possibly disappoint. Go see it in the theater! Don't wait forever for it to be available to stream. Heads up: It is a solid three hours long. So don't drink much because you won't want to miss anything. His original version he wanted to put out was 4.5 hours long (so I was told by a friend that read it from a credible source)! I think hard core Tarantino fans wouldn't have minded that. As long as they fit in a 15 minute potty break, I totally would rather have seen that version. Who knows what brilliance we missed out on! Haha!But seriously: If you are familiar with Tarantino's work and styles and/or a huge fan GO SEE IT SOON!!!! If you are reading this and you don't \"get\" Tarantino or know much about his works, you may be confused and not understand the film. It's very layered in an unexplainable way.Loved this film!! I hope you love and enjoy it as much as I did! Happy Tarantino-ing!", "Tarantino's homage to late '60s Hollywood": "This, the ninth film from writer director Quentin Tarantino, is set in Hollywood in 1969. It is centred on former TV cowboy Rick Dalton, who is now taking lesser roles; and his friend and stunt double Cliff Booth. Rick's next door neighbours are director Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate. In the early part of the film we learn more about Rick and Cliff's back story and see Rick attempting to find new roles better than the one off TV bad guy parts he's been getting. Ominously we are also introduced to Charlie Manson's infamous family at Spahn Ranch when Cliff gives one of them a lift home. Everything is fairly peaceful till the fateful night when Manson orders members of his 'family' to kill everybody in Tate's house.Having enjoyed Tarantino's previous films I was keen to watch this; despite having a different tone to his other films I think it is up there with his best. The story moves at a gentle pace and we get to know all the main characters really well before the action starts. Those watching for Tarantino's trademark violence might be disappointed as, apart from a few scenes which take place within Rick's movies, it is limited to a couple of scenes and then only the finale is very violent. Everything about the film looked great and the cast were on impressive form. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt excelled as Rick and Cliff and Margot Robbie was great as Sharon Tate. Knowledge of films and events of the era are likely to improve one's enjoyment of the film but I wouldn't say it is essential. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film, especially if you are a fan of Tarantino's other works.", "Quentin Tarantino returns!": "Quentin Tarantino returns, refreshed, with this funny, beautiful period piece, wrapping his story's loopy laces around movie lore and history, and mixing life and art into a cool, wild collage. Good story despite few gruesome scenes.\nThe story takes place in the same time as the infamous Manson murders and plot hits along points relating to that real life story. I started to get sad being reminded of what happened to pregnant Sharon Tate. But the last 30 minutes is when I enjoyed it the most! Q.T gave it a wonderful and cool Q.Tarentino ending by flipping the script on the Manson killers while the victims get a happy ending.The story and characters in this film are top-notch. The 2 main characters have a deep, supportive friendship that is deeply touching. Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors, so it's no surprise I loved this film.", "Everything awesome!!!": "1) amazing how everything just like 1969... cars, clothing, hair, streets, stores, music, LA freeway NOT bumper to bumper.... very nostalgic for me!!!!2)kept my attention the entire time3)Wasn't aware of the plot, then recognized character names, .... So was sure I knew the ending....\nBUT didn't see this ending coming....got hints throughout the movie that these characters paths would cross... neat how it all came together at the end4)love Quentin Tarantino movies for surprising twists, turns and a little gore at the end5)nice job with shot angles - got some good views of LA ...other times I felt like I was there like when Sharon and Roman were driving in car I felt like I was in the back seat and when people played records it was a shot that gave me the feeling I was putting record on player or the shot from the roof I felt like I was standing on the roof!!! So cool!6)love \ud83d\udc95 love \ud83d\udc95 love \ud83d\udc95 the ending ...... good over evil and didn't see it coming!", "Extremely enjoyable but left craving a little extra": "The film was great the cast were great it was enjoyable as much when it was slow as the fast paced ending but the end for me did leave me wanting a little more Tarentino chaos than we got but I guess we can't have it all...", "Worst film I've ever seen": "Quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen. Went to the bathroom just for the sake of going for a walk. Hyper anti-climax and dismal gesture at a nod to the 60's", "Terrible terrible movie!": "Avoid. It's a bunch of free running scene without any plot line or editing. Watching out of your windows would be more gripping.", "Tarantino has done it again": "It was a classic Tarantino movie. Acting was top-notch. Nice to see Brad Pit making a come back as well. A bit slow at times but overall fantastic.Highly recommend!", "Too hyped!": "I actually fell asleep during this movie.\nNot at all what I was expecting.", "Tarantino back to his best": "I loved this film right off the bat. Leo and Brad play actors in hollywood, Brad is Leos stunt double. Sharon Tate played by Margot Robbie happens to live next door. This film is a love letter to old hollywood it is a great look at what the industry was like back then. It also shows how hollywood can chew up and spit you out being that Rick played Leo thinks hes a has been. Brad is really funny in this role and so is Leo. Margot even though her role was small it was a really heartfelt and a beautiful performance. Some great cameos by Al Pacino and more. The cinematography was stunning the soundtrack was cool. The dialogue as always with Tarantino is fun to listen to. I loved this film. 4 stars. One of the best of the year.", "Greeeeat": "If you have read/heard some of the backstory, you're gonna love it", "REAL review of a genre inventing film": "This is not only QTs best film it's also one of the best films in the past few years. QT successfully creates a whole new genre of film, one he first attempted with Inglorious Basterds and then perfected with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. A lot of viewers have skewed visions of this movie because they went in expecting a very QT type movie (crazy violent, abundance of diverse characters) and a story about the Manson murders. Although OUTH is these two elements, they are beautiful woven and blurred to suit this tale of the fall of the golden age of Hollywood. I too went in with the expectation of a Manson/Tate centric story and became more and more confused as the movie went on focusing more on the fictional characters Rick and Cliff. This confusion only heighten my curiosity and therefore my movie anxiety as well, fuelling my movie going experience for the positive. We go to movies to escape, for an enjoyable time (think the audience all laughing at Tate's movie), to take refuge from their own reality for a little while. This all became relevant to me the moment at the end when the title 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' appeared on the screen. Where does this saying come from? Fairly tales, that's exactly what this film is, it's an adult fairy tale. It all made sense to me and totally floored me when I tied it all together. This was QTs loveletter to Hollywood and really why not? Most of people in this world especially mainlanders love the movies, the Manson murders change Hollywood and therefore the world, was it for the better? Doesn't matter it was a major change that shaped the Hollywood conscious to what it is today. What if it never happen? That's what fairy tales, are taking elements of real life and changing in a way that will showcase a different perspective. A fantasy. This is a fantasy fairy tale for all our 3 main leads, Rick= wants so badly to break into the movie scene, does not want to be type casted anymore. Wants success in Hollywood. Fairy tale ending: Rick will meet Roman Polanski, who will be grateful he saved the life of his wife and unborn child, Roman will put Rick in his movies thus helping Rick achieve is desires, happy ending for Rick. Cliff= the whole movie it's very clear Cliff does a lot of the heavy lifting but gets no credit, Cliff is never recognized for the work he does by anyone other than Rick. Cliff is type of person we all can be if we really really need to be, Cliff chooses to be this person all the time and is constantly chastised for it. Cliffs life is exactly what a stunt double is, does all the hard work but credit goes elsewhere. After the ending of OUTH Cliff will be a national hero, he will be recognized for the things he does, there will be no denying Cliff himself is a hero (like the Cowboys Rick plays), Cliffs 'dark' actions will be celebrated instead of constantly ridiculed (murdered his wife? Beat up Bruce lee). Happy ending for Cliff. Sharon= very obvious, she lives, will lead a beautiful happy life. People keep saying what's the point of Rick and Cliff in this real life story? it's not a real life story! it's a fairy tale! which needs hero's, hero's that QT created to perfectly fit this story and time period. The story isn't the only element that makes this a standout film, QT perfectly re creates LA life. I was fortunate to live in LA for a slice, and that's mostly all you do, ride around, windows down, listening to the best songs and go from event or place, to place. I truly felt like I was with Rick, Cliff and Sharon on this journey, there were times I just wanted to keep cruising around L.A. with Cliff haha. This is not a boring film, each scene is very important to understanding our hero's and motivations. People get upset cause this wasn't a 'QT' movie, the man can make any kind of movie he wants, he is a story teller, he told this story beautifully. The acting, probably the best and most range I've seen Leo deliver to date, he was funny (name another Leo character that made you laugh other than Gilbert Grape), sympathetic, pathetic and real, who hasn't had a self talk/breakdown? Heck, he even sings and dances in this one, I feel it's Leo's best work where he isn't just not playing an angry fella with an accent. I don't need to see anymore movies this year, Brad Pitt should win the Oscar for Cliff, Cliff steals every scene he's in, he's the coolest character to navigate the screen since Jeff 'dude' Labowski, you just wanna be friends with Cliff. BPitt conveys all this with not very much dialogue if you think about it, a lot of Cliffs character is displayed and defined by his actions (wanting to ensure everything is safe and copacetic with old George). Pitt should win the Oscar. I also really hope QT gets some Oscar love too, whether it be in the form of writing, directing or best picture. I loved the movie, you don't have to, but at least go into it looking at it for what it actually is and not what it's suppose to be. Thank you QT for giving us an adult fairy tale about Hollywood we can all learn from (I know a lot of viewers had little to no knowledge of the Manson murders beforehand) and enjoy. You watch how many copycat 'adult fairy tales' will be coming out in the future, like Pulp Fiction QT continues to create moulds for Hollywood to follow and thrive, QT put his personal message scene 2 movies too soon. 'I think this just might be my masterpiece' muttered by Pitt at the end of Inglorious Basterds should have been said by Cliff as he pulled away in the ambulance at the end of OUTH.", "Loved it": "Okay, so I just, like ten minutes ago, watched it. And loved it ! Maybe because I was born in the late 60s, grew up watching all those old films shown the titles n theaters and posters everywhere, so I understand the vibe and feel, which made me feel nostalgic. Also, the uproar around Bruce Lee, one of my idols, if not The Idol for me ? The whole scene felt totally believable, but with a pinch of salt too - sorry Shannon... I loved Tarantino's meandering, a tribute to a bygone period and a 'what if' finale outcome where Sharon Tate and co are spared their real world fate. Also, the little tidbits sprinkled liberally in the film of characters and personal interactions, such as Rick and Trudi Fraser, with Schwarz as well then Cliff and Pussycat etc. Nice to see Kurt Russell and Luke Perry (may he RIP).The whole pic just felt a little trip down Tarantino's twist on Hollywood of the 1960s, and how Sharon was saved. But the crazy assed Spahn ranch goons get their come uppance, in a very much spaghetti western way, just like the films Cliff starred in, hahaha. It was all great fun, loved it !", "Once upon a time .... is truly high art": "All of the 10/10 reviews say it all. This is a movie that sticks with you. Seen it twice in the two days it was released. On my way to see a third :-)", "A Stylish, Highly Entertaining Slow-Burn Played Out Over 2 Days at the Sunset of Hollywood's \"Golden Age\"": "The stories of a young, radiant up-and-coming starlet, a fading old Western actor, and his cool, loyal, and regretless stunt double intertwine on a fateful summer night in 1969 at the dusk of Hollywood's \"Golden Age\" when a rabid bunch of hippy-cultists at the orders of Charlie Manson go out to seek violent revenge.For those who aren't familiar with the backstory, Charlie Manson was an aspiring musician, who had become friends with the main drummer bandmember of the legendary group, \"The Beach Boys\", Dennis Wilson, and after crashing at Wilson's pad for a while and gaining some interest from him, Wilson set up a meeting with Terry Melcher, Doris Day's son, who was a successful music producer in Hollywood. Manson got the meeting with Melcher at his home on Cielo drive, but Melcher decided not to sign Manson after having some unsettling encounters with him at the Spahn ranch, where Manson eventually moved to and organize his infamous cult full of young girls and runaways, whom he would brainwash and take advantage of. A young Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate eventually began renting out Melcher's home where Manson thought Melcher was still living, and Manson and his girls were angry at Melcher for not giving him his record deal he wanted. The rest is pretty much history.The event was important because it basically was symbolic of the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood, when all innocence was finally lost once and for all.Tarantino captures the final days of the Golden Age through the eyes of fading Western actor Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio), his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and how they experience this shiny world of big dreams, fading careers, and at the time, an influx of \"hippies\".About 80% of the movie captures the lives of each of these characters over the course of 2 days in February of 1969, as DiCaprio struggles to accept his fading star, Robbie happily enjoys her rising star, and Pitt is stuck in a business-as-usual mode where he has accepted that his career will never be anything more than a stunt double for Dalton, but he's okay with that.This is a very good film, but for those who are expecting anything similar to Tarantino's most recent movies like Django Unchained, Inglourious Basterds, or Hateful Eight, they may be disappointed at this one because for a large majority of the movie, Tarantino is relatively reserved, and that includes the very ending. There is very little over-the-top style Tarantino dialogue; rather, the film is subdued and the dialogue may be the most realistic Tarantino has ever had in his films. This is not a bad thing, and it's a refreshing break from what is expected.For Tarantino fans who prefer Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, or even Kill Bill Volume I as his best thus far, this may also land among your top 3 in his film catalogue. Expectations should be checked, however; although it is a very good movie and very enjoyable, calling it a masterpiece would probably be going too far. This is really just pure movie entertainment that is extremely well-constructed and well acted.DiCaprio gives one of his best acting performances ever, Margot Robbie is excellent as Tate (it will be interesting to see how many awards nominations she gets since her screentime and lines were limited, but when she is on screen, she is captivating and plays the role to perfection), and Pitt is solid as well.There is very little action or violence relative to what one would expect (again, a good thing), no sex or nudity, and the movie is grounded and humble overall. As meticulous and detailed as each scene is, there isn't anything overly embellished. Instead, the majority of the movie is a look at the fading career of DiCaprio's Rick Dalton, who is still landing roles in Western TV shows, but has now gone from the leading man to the bad guy, a sign that he is no longer as valued compared to new actors.There is plenty of humor and laugh out loud, quirky moments, and the overall feel of the movie is usually comedic. This is a movie for people who really like time pieces, historical events/nostalgia, the behind-the-scenes reality of acting and filmmaking, and for people who like more realism to their movies, as well as people who like movies with great acting in it.It is a slow burn and takes its time in building the suspense, as it meditates on DiCaprio's acting roles, Pitt's part in helping his career, and the earlier days of Hollywood glamour and nightlife.If you are just looking for a fun, entertaining, realistic, and well made movie with a good story and great acting, then you will enjoy what Tarantino has put together with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.", "Special movie": "That was the long-awaited new movie from Quentin Tarantino - Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\nWhat's up with the name, becomes more clear at the end of the movie.All in all a special movie, which is intended especially for fans of Tarantino.\nIts a journey through his previous works and studded with hints to his preferences.\nGenial is also the short scene after the credits.For many moviegoers, the film could be tough in some places.\nI even think that the movie would be difficult if it would be the first movie which I had seen from him.In general, I was surprised how the movie went in the first half, because a long time it was not clear what goal the film was pursuing.\nUntil the end of the film, heights were indicated again and again, but the expected climaxes were missing.\nWhat Tarantino sets on are the acting performances of Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt (the cast in general was outstanding).\nUnfortunately, Margot Robbie stayed a little pale, would have liked to see more of her.\nDespite the outstanding performance of Di Caprio, I especially remembered the character of Brad Pitt.\nCliff Booth is one of the best and coolest character, which has been staged by Tarantino.Finally, it can be said that the film was great and I would like to see the movie again.", "Once Upon A Time..": "This film takes place in the late 60s around the time of hippies, western movies and celebrity parties. If you love the aesthetic of Hollywood in the 60s or just need a good laugh then definitely watch this film! 100% recommend especially if your a fan of Quentin Tarantino!", "What a waste of time": "Poor character development, no plot, unexplainable reactions, nothing leads to nowhere. Margot Robbie is somehow misfitted in the story and looks like her scenes were just inserted to justify her presence on the actors sheet. Pointless character.\nBrad Pitt was acting pretty well. Leo had just a poor and uncharming character.\nNothing leads to nowhere.\nWhat a deception mr Tarantino", "What's the hype?": "I liked few QT movies before and so I had some expectations from this movie, after all it's been long I haven't watched good Hollywood movie since many years. And boom. This was bad too. Not funny, no story, no dialogue. What was the role of Sharon Tate ? I think she should have given some more meaningful work to do. Why mock Bruce Lee? Anything is fine under the label of jokes and humor? Am I missing something? Only one scene for Charles Manson? Let's kill the people who taught us violence? WTF? This is how QT targeted his criticism about violence in his films? I am scared of over hyped Hollywood movies and TV shows. In every industry the customer satisfaction is important and if not fulfilled we at least get our money or time back, I can't do that when it comes to movie.", "Never disappoints. Laughed my head off": "Although i'm too young to understand the whole background story ( didn't really knew what happened in the film industry during that time ) but now i'm really curious to find out. Acting , dialogues and music were just so fascinating and fitting. Thank you Mr.Tarantino", "Great detailed but slow movie": "I am a big fan of QT and this movie was really detailed in de hippy time but I was missing something in those first 2 hours of the story. That Bruce parody was fun but when making a story about the Hollywood life make some 'Hollywood'-ish action scenes that fit in the interests like other movie QT made. Don't end most scenes the same with just an information-plot.\nConclusion: a bit too slow for all the minutes spend in scenes. For the rest great acting and details! Please make the next movie less 'boring'. And sorry I said that ;)Just 4 stars because I lost interest and I normally don't...", "Best \ud83d\ude0d": "The best of the best , its realy good movie and i think it was based on the true story its another reason why its a one of the best movies", "embarrassing reviews here": "I get that people felt this movie hard and boring BUT its Tarantino for f sake. This movie is like other tarantionos long takes and long overall. But you need to have the patient. I have nerver seen this level of acting ever! DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie is all on oscar level and the details are amazing. This is a wonderfull loveletter from Tarantino to Hollywood", "A stunning ode to Hollywood and La La Land": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood might just be Tarantino's most accomplished film to date. Masterfully directed, with one of the most satisfying endings to a film. The script is deliberately long and fletched out, with multiple overlong scenes that add brilliant depth to a stunning film. The razor sharp dialogue adds to an already stunningly beautiful film. As great as Brad Pitt is in this, Leonardo DiCaprio just proved why he is Hollywood's golden boy. A performance many won't appreciate fully, but DiCaprio really shines and gives a performance reminiscent of old Hollywood where actors understand characterization and emotive scenes.", "Not great, in very poor taste.": "Considering the dreadful crimes of the so called Manson family, this should have at least told the truth.Acting is excellent!, music excellent, camera & production is quality!.I gave it 5 only because of a rather weird script, the usual and now very exhausted, Tarantino style of subject jumping and out of sequence scenes which no longer work!, It's Old Now!It could have been great but for using Sharon Tate who was of course dreadfully murderd along with her unborn child and many others murdered by the Mason Family.Add to that the upset caused to the family of Bruce Lee, by the way Lee was represented in a rather unforgettable scene in this movie.I did not watch it when it was first released, mainly because it was a Tarantino movie and (only my opinion) they tend to be hard to watch.Now 2022, a friend suggested I watch it, she considered it dreadful, while another (male friend) considered it a great movie.My opinion, I am over the scene hopping, worse still the unrelated scenes which serve no purpose other that to insult or belittle. IT was not a great movie nor even a good Tarantino movie for that matter!.", "Rip off of a great Japanese movie": "If you really want to watch a masterpiece of an old era ending, which this movie tried and failed miserably, watch \"Uzumasa Limelight\". Watch both movies and see for yourself that if this script didn't have QT stamped on it, no one would accept this trash. There's nothing to say about this joke of a movie, besides wasting talents like Al Pacino and three hours of your time. Uzumasa Limelight, that's how a movie is done. Wake up QT.", "Still Witty, Still Unrestrained, Still Tarantino - Just Not As Much": "I'm not going to preface this by saying I'm a diehard Tarantino fan. I'm not, though I do for the most part respect his films. Inglorious Basterds is one of my favorite movies. That being said, this was all Tarantino, just... underwhelming. I walked away feeling partially unsatisfied when it comes to Quentin Tarantino. Objectively, this was a good movie with some twists that I appreciate and I'll look at it that way. I can't help but think that while the character arcs were filled, the Tarantino action and suspense quota was left incomplete.", "Best movie of the year going to be very unappreciated": "This movie was amazing, from the beginning to the end Tarantino keeps u obsessed with the world of Hollywood in the 1960s and I could have stayed there for hours and hours and hours. The performances in this movie are sublime especially from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. While Margot Robbie doesn't have as much screen time as some might think, her presence in the film is definitely felt as she perfectly everything that goes into playing Sharon Tate. While this movie may feel slow the ending is so Tarantino that is feels all worth it. From the direction to the acting to even the music this is a beautiful movie and a must see for anyone.", "A love letter to old Hollywood": "Before watching this film, I watched some 60's movies and with Sharon Tate in them. Needless to say, I felt Tarantino's love for the period and some of the references put me in this state of nostalgia for a period I never lived in.A lot of the scenes just put a smile on my face. Brad Pitt and Leo were amazing, I was cheering for their characters and hoped it would turn out alright for them for the whole movie. The last 40 minutes or so put me in this amazing feeling of dread, I was in the edge of my seat and I loved it.I thought it was a breath of fresh air from today's movies, thank God for Tarantino's dedication to shoot on film.", "Great cast makes up for a somewhat labored journey of a film": "There are certain expectations of a Quentin Tarantino film, but while some of them in this case are lost or held back until the last minute, the movie as a whole delivers another neat alternative-history that can be considered an homage to late 60's Hollywood.Where the movie could drag out with its overall length and sometimes labored and not-entirely-clear narratives, the performances of the cast make up for it.Both Leo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt give outstanding performances, and Margot Robbie was gorgeous in every scene she's in. Kurt Russell gets his moment and makes me wish we had more of him in the movie. Al Pacino was not terrible, but his character seemed a bit too one-dimensional and it was hard to really get into his scenes.As similar to what I've seen in Inglorious Basterds and the Hateful 8, there are scenes where the suspense slowly builds, and you are left hanging on for the climax, to a point where you are silently screaming for it, good or bad, and the end result gives you a moment to finally sigh at the suspense finally ending.There are some moments for you to, at the very least, chuckle, and relax, but as with any Tarantino film, you never get a real chance to relax long.Overall, the movie is very solid and is something fresh in the midst of never-ending sequels and remakes, and continues to show how much of a creative mind Tarantino is, and how he continues to churn out fantastic films, one after another.", "Not what anyone might expect": "That is not a bad thing. What IS disappointing is how much the film drags with scenes that just bored and should have been left on the cutting rooms floor. One that comes to mind is a scene where a 9 year old GIRL {actor], NOT actresses, is forced to say dialogue that never would have been a thought in the late 60's, not even by an adult or feminist. The scene where the Manson family resides goes on far too long waiting for some terrible thing to happen. Then it switches to horror movie gimmick as we follow the back of the pit character walking through what could be Leatherface's house to find a senile old man ,'BOO'. Very manipulative with little pay off.Talk about manipulating the audience.All of the Manson followers look like the craft device of a days filming of THE WALKING DEAD.\nThe ending is not what one would expect,Thank God, hence the title,ONCE UPON A TIME..... In HOLLYWOOD was still very sad. I left the theater quite upset by the ending. But in the end it was a great title for what is in store.Just not as clever as his better works.", "Some will like it, some will not": "This is a great Tarantino movie, it has incredible scenes like the one at the Spahn ranch, that scene is terrifying. This movie has a good use of comedy and violence, and a really good plot twist at the end when the Manson hippies are killed, but not everyone would like the movie especially because some people say that the movie is long and slow, but if you are a Tarantino fan you will definitely will like this movie.", "No storyline...a disjointed mess": "I should have known better as it is a Tarantino movie, but this one is just all over the place. A self-indulgent POS. I don't need to feel good about myself by leaving a great 10 star review. Crap is crap....be honest.", "Incredibly difficult to watch with little reward": "I love Tarantino movies. Not this. I made it though 1 hour 40 before giving up. I was given nothing. Might finish it one day but others tell me it is confusing unless you happen to know the true Sharon Tate story which I did but did not connect with this story. It might be me!", "Not Oscar-Worthy, but a Good Movie for the Year": "I was shocked that this prevailed to get nominated in 4 of the 5 most prestigious awards guilds this year. It's definitely a good and fun movie for the year, but I didn't see anything too \"award worthy\" about it on that level that it has a legitimate shot at Best Picture at the Oscars.Can see DiCaprio getting a nom, and Tarantino maybe just barely making a nom, but it must be weak competition for this to outdo some other films this year. This is certainly not as award-worthy as Eastwood's Richard Jewell, which is getting snubbed in favor of such an underachieving movie like this one, albeit an underachieving movie I still enjoyed.", "Nothing \"funny\" about Manson/Tate.": "I'm old enough to remember the slaughter of the pregnant Sharon Tate by Charles Manson and his depraved cult of followers. This film is emblematic of everything that is wrong with Hollywood today. Trivializing the consequences of a sick and drug-addled mind, glorifying violence and acting with complete insensitivity for the feelings of those who were affected. It would probably be hard for a modern audience to envision someone making a comedy about the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. It's bad enough that the prosecution successfully made a comedy of the trial! Just one more example of why I never want to hear anyone from Hollywood giving the rest of us advice on how to live or how to vote!", "A fine achievement - QT": "This movie is a pleasure to watch so much so that you feel like you have begun to inhabit it. Its NOT slow as many people have said. It's simply well made, it cuts fast when it needs to, not constantly every 4-6 seconds which is essentially a flat line editing style. Juice filled shots satisfy because QT has considered what will work best. He uses low tracking shots that are partially obscured to draw you into the moment of meeting a new character. He lets the camera fly high when he wants to create more distance. But its always a voyeuristic feel and that us spot on. Combining well with slower fly on the wall solo scenes in the confines of a caravan. He constantly moves from location to location with cool shots of cool cars cruising through LA. Which buys him space to slow down and establish character, its not self indulgent he's seen the potential problem and fixed it.Why has no one mentioned that it is an excellent buddy movie, thats its core. Alpha and Beta wolves, and just as much in nature the alpha is the neurotic one burdened with responsibilities and worry, the beta is too busy running around for the alpha to be overly concerned with anything beyond the day ahead. Two sides of men split into two characters is a clever play, Especially as that dichotomy often comes out when guys hit 50+. Its smart to offset that with Sharon Tates carefree period in her life. And again with the young girl in the TV PILOT.Excellent work, make another one quick QT while your STILL on a roll.", "Terrible! I was excited for this, unfortunately.": "I cannot believe I wasted the time on the this movie. Great actors, some good moments, but not enough to redeem it.Leo's character was so whiny and pathetic! I had hoped he would redeem himself somehow by realizing a truth about aging and being famous, but no. I already know most actors are like this!Brad was great, but some of the fight scenes seemed contrived. He was much less annoying.Margot Robbie did well, but a lot of things she did added nothing to the plot! Actually, there was no plot.No characters are explored, no details are explained, a bunch of scenes are thrown together that add nothing to the movie, and it is MUCH TOO LONG. Why was there so much needless filler here??On the plus side, I enjoyed seeing how Lena Dunham exists outside the Hollywood scene :)", "a lot went down fifty summers ago": "Quentin Tarantino gives us another tribute to lowbrow entertainment, this time an homage to Hollywood's transition to mature material. \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" focuses on an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) in 1969 Los Angeles, a bastion of hippies, old-school agents, and the Mansons...and the protagonist lives next door to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).This brings to mind all the things that happened in summer 1969. The obvious one is the Manson family's deeds, but there was also Judy Garland's death (and the subsequent Stonewall uprising), the moon landing, and Woodstock. And just as the world was about to move into autumn, Moammar Qaddafi seized power in Libya. What a world it must've been (for the record, I was born long after the '60s). As \"Alice's Restaurant\" reminded us, every generation has a story to tell.Anyway, it's an impressive movie. I hope that it wins at least one Oscar.", "The dream team": "When you put together Tarantino, DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Pacino, Damian Lewis you have the dream team. It's a great director with a loyal fan base and outstanding actors with a loyal fan base of their own, you know the acting and the screenplay will deliver and you hope for a masterpiece.But when you have all of the above you are expecting way too much, you are hoping for perfection and you value the movie for its potential and not for its raw material. Superb acting it's just not enough, good music and nostalgic references are not enough and a very good ending won't be enough.It's a good movie, boring for the people that saw it with me for the most part and I counted 4 people sleeping during most of the film in the cinema, but not for me I like it, I enjoy it, but I left with the feeling that it could be a lot more, maybe my own high expectations did not let me appreciate it, maybe I kept thinking of pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, and django all the way through, or maybe it's just a miss opportunity that only the true western and Hollywood sentimentalists will appreciate from beginning to end.", "One of Tarantino's Lesser Movies": "I want to start off by saying that this movie was wonderfully produced. Everything from a technical standpoint of filming is sensational here- the soundtrack, the cinematography, and the acting. There is a really great scene between DiCaprio and a little girl that made me laugh out loud. Brad Pitt kinda just makes the same face the whole movie, and Margot Robbie has so little to do in this film. That being said, they both kill it when they are on screen and the chemistry between DiCaprio and Pitt is phenomenal. The last fifteen minutes really showcase this duo's talents.In my opinion, the biggest problem with this movie is that it is really boring at times. Nothing really happens in the first 2 hours of this film, and Sharon Tate has absolutely no role in the plot. It seems to me that this movie was intended to be a tribute to the 60s, and nothing further than that. I will probably never see this movie again.", "An unaccomplished nostalgia flick": "Tarantino's ode to the Hollywood of his childhood. There are random scenes that work but overall, there's nothing of substance or entertainment value here.Also, the film could have every scene with Margot Robbie cut & would lose nothing narratively. Essentially, a pointless, needless story told by someone who has romanticized how others told stories.", "Just a nonsense movie": "It was very frustrant spend 2:40 of my life seeing this movie. I think Tarantino is a big joker, he knows that any trash he does your legion of fans is gonna calling him genius", "Just Terrible": "One of the worst movies i have ever watched. Good thing QT is finished making movies because this by far was his worst one yet. I wish i could get back the 2h40min of my life back. The worst movie ever is wicker park, This is second. It has no point and is nonsense.", "Absolute trash movie, do not waste your time or money.": "One of the worst films I've ever seen, and I am fan of Tarantino. No plot, so many pointless things that we're shown that lead no where. I went in with great expectations and can honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even the worst movies still have some semblance of a plot. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.", "shoot me!": "I normally like Quentin Tarantino stuff but this is getting beyond. Ponderous, slow and uninteresting; these are usually not adjectives that you associate with Tarantino. The list of actors is impressive, Yet somehow they do not gel into one block buster of a film. The individual storys merge into one melting pot of a snapshot of hollywood life. Now you'd think that would make for a good film,. And it would - if only it were about a third shorter. By 2 hours in I was \"shoot me and let this end\"!", "Better to skip it :(": "I saw number of good critics but I also heard a lot of people who complained that movie is so boring. Unfortunately, the second group was totally right! I wanted to give it a chance... and I did. I managed to stay by the end but hey - you know how is the movie when you are barely managing to stay by the end :(. Very, very boooring! Some people say: golden age of Holywood - c'mon, every documentary is more interesting than this movie. After 2 hours and 15 minutes there is a short entertaining 10 minutes where some plots will be combined. But even then I don't understand why 90% of the movie is filmed!? Only interesting character is Brad's and he did a good job. Leo was OK but his character is the boring one. The rest od the movie is irrelevant. I think that this became popular solely on QT brand and leading roles. But nobody expected so big miss. Unfotunately, I think that QT should be skiped for some time so that he must try much harder to deserve back people's attention.", "Brilliant film": "Really worth a watch, the directing and acting is amazing, for such a horrible event.", "It subverted, subverting, subversives and censors": "This movie was awesome for it's complexity, and the funny way it poked fun at Hollywood. Like all of his movies it was simultaneously current and classic at once. Quentin Tarantino is one of the few Writer/Directors these days clever enough to call his movies art.", "the first QT film I didn't like.": "Well, I have to say, I didn't like this movie, and I've pretty much loved Tarantino's films to date. Really, this didn't even feel like one of his pictures. Where was the wonderful dialogue, the banter, the witty repartee? Almost completely absent in this, except for just a little from child actor Julia Butters. A very little. DiCaprio's character is super lame, and the fact that we have to watch him act in a movie within this movie is just torture. As are the long, purposeless driving scenes. Yeah, just driving. And honestly, where the plot ends up is not a surprise, as Tarantino did the same type of thing in a previous, far superior film of his.\nBright spots are Margot Robbie, who is just amazingly gorgeous, Margaret Qualley, who just dominated her scenes, and Al Pacino, who creates a heck of character that disappointingly just disappears from the film. (actually, when he pops up in his second scene, I had completely forgot he was in the film! I guess those driving scenes had lulled me to complacency.) Oh yeah, and Bruce Dern was hilarious as George Spahn!\nOverall, just totally disappointed. Had Tarantino's name not been on it, I totally would have turned this off at the 30 minute mark. He does throw in his trademark over-the-top-disgusting violence near the end, but really, this seems like a movie by someone else. And not a good someone else.", "Tarantino gives us his recollection of Hollywood in 1969, even though he was only 6 then..": "I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped. Then I watched it again 4 days later. You get so much more after you know what to expect. With as much press this movie has received, including just winning the Golden Globe for Best Picture, I was skeptical, I was prepared for a letdown. But I wasn't, I thoroughly enjoyed and was entertained by its 2 hour and 40 minute running time.The year 1969 is memorable for a number of reasons, the moon landing, my finishing graduate school, the Chappaquiddick incident, my first daughter being born. And also Sharon Tate. The story here comes to a climax on August 9th, 1969 which is the day Tate was murdered by members of the Manson family. Anyone seeing this movie and not knowing that will likely be confused.The running story involves two fictional characters, Leonardo DiCaprio as somewhat famous TV Western actor Rick Dalton, and his old pal, almost like a brother, Brad Pitt as Dalton's stunt double, Cliff Booth, who also happens to be well-trained and well-equipped as an accomplished fighter. Dalton' career is on the decline, he is afraid he is on the verge of has-been, so he goes to Italy to make several spaghetti westerns.Cliff is getting less and less work, but doesn't appear to worry about it at all, happy to live frugally with his dog in a small trailer behind the seedy drive-in theater. He remains loyal to his friendship with Rick.Margot Robbie is the only other I will mention, she is good as Sharon Tate who, with her husband Roman Polanski, lives next door to Dalton. In his movie \"Inglourious Basterds\" Tarantino writes a completely different story of Hitler in WW2, suffice to say his writing of the fate of Sharon Tate for this movie also departs significantly from history. Sort of a \"what if things had happened differently?\"The only complaint I have is that so much of the dialog is filled with filthy language, not just an occasional F-bomb here and there but FILLED with it. That is Tarantino's style, I think he does it too much, but it is his movie. Even with that I find this to be an excellent and entertaining movie, deserving of its accolades. I watched it twice before I returned the BD to the library, the second viewing was as entertaining as the first.The extras on the disc are interesting also.", "Another awful Tarantino movie": "Boring, dull, stupid, meaningless. A total waste of time. This movie is highly overrated. My advice to you: run, don't walk away from this piece of garbage.Note to self: never ever give another chance to any Tarantino movie.", "Disappointing film": "There is very little substance to the story, it is safe to say that this is not QT's best work.", "The Best Quentin Tarantino Film To Date .": "In my opinion , yeah yeah yeah , I know , we've all got one , Hollywood is Tarantino's best work and definitely Leonardo Di Caprio's best performance to date - that is why I'm giving this film a 10 .Everything is done so meticulously well - the period settings , the humour , the acting , the costumes , the cinematography , the soundtrack , everything .The problem some people have with this film is the pace , the length and lack of ' action ' , however the acting more than makes up for this especially the two leads who are both superb .Like I said , the BEST Tarantino film to date .Thank you for making it .", "The latest in a long, long line of Tarnatino clunkers. Baffling - why was it made?": "First of all a fact: IMDb reports that Tarantino's latest (as of January 6, 2020, when I am writing this review) cost an estimated $90 million and recouped almost half that in its opening US weekend ($41 million). Released six months ago, it has already grossed $141 million in the US and \u00c2\u00a3372.5 million worldwide. There will be more moolah to come, and even more once it is released on video. So there's just one reason why Tinseltown's moneymen will gladly finance any old hooey that Tarantino wants to produce: the returns are fabulous, and we all know that at the end of the day we must ignore all the bull about 'an important new film', 'artistic integrity' and I don't know what else and just listen to the sound of the only thing that counts, continual ringing of the till.I liked Tarantino's first 'breakthrough' film, Reservoir Dogs, and I liked Pulp Fiction. Both were in their own way originals. Jackie Brown was also quite good, though I suspect that was more down to Elmore Leonard's story than Tarantino's filmmaking. But since then? Dear soul, what is going on? But while he sucks in the readies, Tinseltown doesn't care.Tinseltown doesn't care in the slightest that Tarantino cannot for the life of himself, or rather seems to have forgotten how to, pace a film. He can write the occasional good line, but a good line here and there can't and doesn't excuse some of the mish-mash dreck he has been coming out with for quite a few years.Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight and now this, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood are simply not very good at all. Certainly far worse films have been made and will be made, but far better films have been made, too. But not by Tarantino. But - I repeat - no one in Hollywood is going to argue with the simple fact with which I began this review: he makes very, very good money for folk who seem to be interested in little else.What, specifically, to make of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood? It is certainly well-made, though that might be more to the credit of Tarantino's producers, but many TV commercials are superbly produced. And everything else about is confusing to pointless to incomprehensible. Essentially the obvious question is: just why did Tarantino bother? Why?When it was released media reviews spoke (in that arch way reviewers have when confronted by yet another clunker by a former wunderkind and they haven't quite got the stomach to say so) of 'Tarantino's love letter to Hollywood', that 'Tarantino pays tribute to filmmaking' and more along those lines. Well, Quentin darling, every thought of making a documentary instead? Why waste your time - and not least our time - with this kind of self-indulgent bull?What is it about? By my reckoning - the 'action' takes up the final 30 minutes of a very long film - something like nine-tenths of the film is redundant, utterly superfluous, pointless: so why include them.Why rewrite the whole Manson family murder tragedy? What was the point? Was there a point? Tarantino must have had something in mind because it certainly isn't entertaining.There are two saving graces to this film: Brad Pitt and Leonardo Di Caprio. Both can add polish to the biggest turd. As for the other actors, well, they just had nothing at all to do. Zilch.So there you have it, another horrible, well-made, pointless clunker from Tarantino. But there will be more, don't worry, as many as he can make will he carries on turning dross into dollars.", "Most boring movie ever": "For the whole 2 hours and 15 minutes nothing happens. Then i left because it was boring as hell", "The most boring movie since AD ASTRA": "Why did they bother making such a pointless movie? No story, meaningless script, and irritating charatcters. Just a bunch of scenes stitched together for no apparent reason. Don't put down your remote; you will need to fast forward frequently if you plan to watch this dissapointing movie.", "A masterpiece movie indeed": "The first two hours are actually to build the plot to get the viewers ready for receiving the history alteration. Like to estblish the strength of Cliff, introducing the Manson followers and their recklessness, friendship between Cliff and Rick and more than 30 tributes to old Hollywood and Western movies. Last 40 minutes are actually the main plot.", "Painful...": "Seriously painful to watch and the length of the movie is just crazy... I watch a lot of movies and this tops the list of the worst movie in recent history....Very artistic but to what purpose....the storyline never really takes off and the movie could haven been shorten to the last 20 mins....and still that would be a pointless movie...", "I Laughed from Beginning to End": "Not a fan of Quentin Tarantino, think his films are ridiculously violent, and hate his obsessive use of the N-word. Contrary to popular belief, Samuel L. Jackson's opinion of the N-word does not reflect the majority of black people's views on the use of that word. The only movies Tarantino directed I liked was the Kill Bill movies because of their style and the fight scenes. So I'm not obsessed with his work. I said all that to say, I'm not a Quentin Tarantino purist. Even though I'm not, I enjoyed this stupid two hour and thirty minute film which I will probably never watch again except maybe in the distant future on television on a Sunday morning when I have way too much time on my hands.Yet, this is a simple movie about the friendship between a falling actor named Rick played by Leonardo DiCaprio and long time stuntman Cliff played by Brad Pitt which just so happens to coincide with the Mansion murders in 1969 and the real life death of rising star actress and wife of director Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate. Rick is in the twilight of his career and Cliff is his best friend/ assistant who always supports him and encourage him not to give up on acting. This movie is crazy and bunkers and had the audience laughing from the beginning to the end. Since the MeToo era, feminists complain about everything including the minor role they believe Margot Robbie had in this movie playing Sharon Tate. Could the character have been played by anyone? Yes, but the reason why Sharon Tate's family approved of this portrayal of Sharon onscreen or let's say compared to Hillary Duff's version is because Margot captured the youthful beauty and spirit of Sharon Tate. Yes, her role is small compared to DiCaprio's and Pitt's, but the point Tarantino was trying to convey, was to allow the audience to get to know her as a real person. In real life, she died at the age of 26 and her career barely begun. Unlike Judy Garland, she didn't have her \"Wizard of Oz\" yet. So beside being forever linked to Charles Manson as the victim he sent his followers to murder, in this movie, we got to see her as a human being. A young, newlywed married to a famous film director and spending her afternoon going to the movies to watch herself on screen in one of her movies. She wasn't a victim in this movie. She was a normal person and that's why her sister Debra Tate approved of her portrayal in this movie. In this alternate universe, Sharon lived and in the unknown future, whatever happened to her life afterwards, was her choice alone. So I enjoyed this movie. Margot captured the essence of Sharon Tate really well. Brad and Leonardo was awesome, but Brad stole the show a little bit. Both had their moments. The last thirty minutes was bananas like Tarantino may have been smoking acid when he was trying to figure out how to end this film.Once Upon a Time was a beautiful love letter to the Golden Era of Hollywood. And if Luke Perry had to leave this world early, Once Upon of Time in Hollywood was a pretty awesome movie for his final film ever listed on IMDb. Anyone who loved old sitcoms from the 60s and 70s, will love how this movie plays homage to them. So to sum it up, it was a good movie. The critics love it. The audience love it. Sharon Tate's family loved it. The guy who played Bruce Lee was amazing too and is renewing interest in a new Bruce Lee story but he too, captured the essence of Bruce Lee. And even in this alternate universe, Rick Dalton loved it too because by saving Sharon Tate and her friends, he saved his career too by the film ending with Rick finally getting what he wanted by living next to a famous director and of course, we all know he's going to bring his right hand man Cliff along with him. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was a beautiful love letter to the greats of the Golden Era like the friendship between the late Burt Reynolds and his stuntman and longtime best friend Hal Needham, Bruce Lee, Sharon Tate, and Roman Polanski (whether you love him or hate him for his sins in his personal life, professionally he's one of the greatest directors of a generation). Great movie, check it out.", "It will help put you to sleep": "I can't believe all the high reviews for this film. While the acting was fine, there is no plot.. When you go see a QT film you expect great dialog, interesting characters and a craziness that only QT provides. This didn't have any of it. It seems liberal Hollywood has cut the balls of QT. This was as boring and dull as you can get. By the time the ending comes, and you get maybe 5 minutes of classic QT it doesn't matter anymore. Very disappointed.", "Meditation On The End Of An Era.": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: There are elements of this film which could be described as fantasy, alternate history or even Forteana but I'll settle for Action/Comedy/Drama, with an emphasis on dark comedy. It's the end of an era in 1969, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is pushing 40, a former film and TV star with his own show, Bounty Killer, he now depends on guest-starring roles in TV Series' and Pilots. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is Dalton's friend and stunt double. Booth now mainly works as a gopher and driver for Rick. Film Agent Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino) tries to convince Dalton to go to Italy to make Spaghetti Westerns. In the background is the Manson Family, we see the girls dumpster diving and one of them, Pussycat ( Margaret Qualley) catches Cliff's eye. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski are Rick's neighbours so a collision between these three groups seems inevitable.\nTarantino captures what seems to be a pastiche of the late 60s, people dance in the bar of a 747, everyone (even the Manson Family) watch Mannix and The FBI Files on TV. Tate goes to watch her own film, thrilling to the audience reactions. She was trained in martial arts by Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) whose run in with Booth resulted in Booth being blacklisted for stunt work. The film within in a film (Lancer pilot show) is hilarious as Dalton plays a villain, when he is reading from a Western novel to precocious child actor Trudi (Julia Butters)about an ageing cowboy he breaks down but goes on to have an inspired scene in the show when he is her kidnapper.Some great scenes at the Spahn Ranch, a former filming set for Westerns, where the Manson Family now reside. Booth gives Pussycat a ride to the ranch where he meets Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning), Manson's lieutenant, who later tried to assassinate President Ford. Cliff is worried about Spahn (Bruce Dern) but finds that he is having a good time with Squeaky. An ever increasing number of Family members watch Booth as he enters Spahn's shack but only Pussycat is outside as he exits. The rest are in a line on a porch barracking him as he departs resulting in brilliant shots.There are a few surprises and some savage violence as the film heads towards it's seemingly inevitable conclusion but the antics of Dalton and Booth provide laughs and entertainment along the way. Especially the sequences from Bounty Killer and Dalton's films. Writer/Director Tarantino delivers a meditation on the end of a Hollywood era. 8.5/10.", "Bland and boring": "This film has fantastic acting but the horrible writing will put you to sleep, Brad is the only thing good about this film but even he can't carry this story on his back\nQT did a fantastic job as director but can write for the life of him. definitely not a must see unless you are a fan of his.", "Modern Classic": "Like all rewatchable greats this one gets better and better with each viewing. Pitt got the accolades and trophies (rightfully so), but this is also DiCaprio's best work, and Tarantino's as well. Like the movie Jaws you'll be watching it 2-3 times a year for the rest of your life and compulsively introducing it to novice viewers along the way with a frenzied glee as you point out all the nuances and inside treasures.", "Pointless...": "When it comes down to it this movie is about nothing. There is a little story with the two leads that hardly goes somewhere but it takes forever to do it. Really every scene is at least twice as long as it should be. A lot of driving around. Scenes that don't mean anything or go anywhere. And the Mansion story doesn't need to be here. It's an arbitrary ending at best. It gives the movie an exciting ending from left field because....?Why the periodic narration? From a character that's sightly in the movie? You can almost smell the cocaine on the screen. How much of this movie was spent watching people watch movies?At the end I was left wondering what this was all supposed to mean. I couldn't think of an answer. Rewriting history for non-comedic value was weird. And I hate to say insensitive to what really happened but it feels that way.QT has to take from something always. Usually it's other movies but this time it was a real event. He couldn't have done something like the Mansions or another attack of theirs, it had to be the one. Because he can't think of something original he needs something to springboard it from. And isn't clever enough to disguise it.This goes for the title. Once Upon a Time was Sergio Leone's thing. Other people have used it in homage to this master but I don't know why this is called that. It feels like he didn't have a title and looked at the posters in his house and picked one. Leo does make movies in Italy, briefly. But Leone isn't mentioned. And they kinda go out of the way not to mention him. So why the title? A reference to a couple good movies. That's it.Of course the acting is great. The characters were good. Margot Robbie is very hot. Especially those legs. Wooo!I'm not a QT fan because he's too self indulgent. He gets off hearing his words. I would wager to bet that this movie was a first draft and didn't have any scenes cut. Because QT thinks everything he does is gold. When he's really a one trick pony. He's afraid to try something new. I used to be a huge fan until I outgrew him.I am surprised at how restrained he was in this though. At least as far as lengthy monologues. He indulged himself in other ways. It's really a shame because he has good ideas, gets good performances but he can't try something else. You think he'd try to be like his idol Scorsese and try to be really diverse. Because that guy can do anything. And is always trying.", "\"The film to end all films\"": "\"'Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood'. Extremely funny and oh so brutal. Just everything you would expect from Tarantino... and even more.It's a delight seeing icons like Steve McQueen, Bruce Lee and Roman Polanski on the big screen, having their own little part in this Hollywood fairytale. The acting is spot on and conversations seem true to the characters. And name a better duo than Pitt and DiCaprio, I'll wait...'Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood' is simply an unforgettable ode to the Golden Age of Cinema. The romantic, nostalgic Hollywood from the 60s is every filmmaker's dream. But that dream ended in the summer of '69, with the murder of the pregnant Sharon Tate. But in this film - just like in 'Inglourious Basterds' - things happen a little bit differently.Tarantino's 9th film shows how the Golden Age of Cinema should have ended! It's truly the film to end all films.\" 10/10", "Long, drawn-out, pretentious rubbish": "Get ready for a whole lot of waiting. Loads of inconsequential indulgent scenes of people doing mundane things and poses.

But hey got some big names so it's ok right?", "It's...Ok?": "Watched this last night and came out of it thinking there wasn't really a story at all just a lot of scenes put together and acted well, worth a watch but probably my least favourite Tarantino movie.", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: has Tarantino Still Got It?": "Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino latest, and plays out just as the title would imply: a story of trials and tribulations in the so-called city of glamour that is Los Angeles. The time is 1969 and in an increasingly modern yet still somewhat chaotic Hollywood, our fictional leads are taken through the same kind of journeys of self-reflection and stylised absurdity that have become a staple of the legendary director's work. Suffering from first-act sluggishness, Tarantino's ninth film ends up being an engrossingly mesmerising retelling of history.Rick Dalton, played by our favourite Oscar-winner, Leonardo DiCaprio, is a famous veteran actor with the direction of his career going stagnant. Being a longtime TV and film star, Dalton's hurt that the recommended next step is for him to take roles in what he deems the lowest form of entertainment: Spaghetti Westerns. After confiding his upset in his driver/part-time stuntman/war hero/possible-wife murderer, Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth, Rick reassures that he'll commit to doing his best and make sure he is ready for set the next day, only to get drunk whilst reading his lines. Featuring Margot Robbie portraying Sharon Tate, an adventure of multiple storylines ensues.While this would normally be \"the boring\" part of a review, it became obvious that talking about the camera work in this movie would be an utter joy because just a couple of minutes in. It's clear that Once A Upon Time in Hollywood's cinematography is part of its identity. A doting tribute to the fine works that came out of 60's LA; Tarantino's direction and masterful cinematographer Robert Richardson's skill in crafting camera angles have come together to birth a hybrid of visual flair. Long, drawn out tracking shots and pans typical of the decade hit you in a slow, humble way; causing you to appreciate everything that's going on and present in a shot. During production of one of Rick's films, the shots utilised offer a captivating in-film peek behind the curtain of how you can be grabbed by a scene done right; making you hang on every word being spoken before you're snapped out of it by a fumbled line or a director yelling \"cut!\".His first film in four years, Leonardo DiCaprio is an unarguably welcomed return, especially with it being a Tarantino feature. As he did in 2013's Django Unchained, DiCaprio reeducates us as to why as an actor, he's a tour de force to be reckoned with. As performer and director, he and Tarantino seem to bring out the best in one another; with the former being able to convey complex emotions and the latter being a definitive writer of incredible dialogue that serves as a foundation to make them shine.The pinnacle of this combination is a scene during Rick's time on set of the Western TV series he was drunkenly reading lines for the night before: Lancer. Getting himself together whilst waiting to film, Dalton strikes up a conversation with his 8-year old co-star about the book he's reading. The more Rick talks about its aging and broken protagonist, it's clear that he's relating to it more than even he realised, becoming more emotional with each word; being a stepping stone for wanting to become a better person. Being a mature filmmaker, Tarantino has further perfected the art of making you root for the flawed heroes in his stories; whom when they achieve some form of resolution, it's likely you'll shed a supporting tear of delight to match their own.As much of a spectacle of a performer DiCaprio is in Once Upon A Time, Brad Pitt is on equal footing. Returning to the Tarantino filmography for the first time since 2009's Inglorious Basterds, Pitt carries his reputable charismatic intensity as the indestructible Cliff Booth, serving in an impeccable back and forth with DiCaprio as well as others around Cliff in his own story; enough to be one of his best roles. The beloved chemistry between the two leads is especially appreciated during the first thirty minutes, where the pacing noticeably drags on enough to make you question where the direction of this story is going, before the progression of the story is finally put back on track.Despite there being arguably too much runtime, there isn't enough of Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate. From a certain perspective, at least. As much of a joy it is to see Robbie bring the late actress to life before her screentime is seemingly cut short, it's not until the events of the film coming full circle in the third act that you understand why. Without going into spoilers, it's the fusion of the director's legacy for stylish brutality and the desire to change history.In addition to the unsparing humour in Quentin Tarantino's films, the merciless violence is at its best when it feels justified; when the recipient of the stabs, blows or gunshots are getting what they righteously deserve. On a scale of 1 to 5, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood turns it up to 13 on the Tarantino Meter: making everything you've seen in the two hours seem like the ultimate roller coaster incline before the most satisfactory drop. Saying you'll laugh in elation is an understatement.\nFinal Thoughts:A beautifully warped portal into 1969 LA, the gorgeous, timely aesthetics and set pieces are not why Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is such a captivating time. Picking up the pace after a stumbled start, this humbled yet enthralling story filled with witty dialogue and Tarantino-esque twists indicates that the director shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to delivering the gut punch of a satisfying finale. Whilst divisive in its audience reception, elements of Once Upon A Time in Hollywood are Quentin Tarantino at his best.", "Knock-out performances from DiCaprio and Pitt": "Once Upon a Time...

Brilliant film and you'll be taken down a brilliant path of comedy and violence. Top acting too", "Very disappointment": "I adore Quentin, which is why I am so sad, I'm sorry, but this film has NOTHING in Quentin's style, the characters are squalid and insipid (nothing to do with great people like Hans Landa, Jules and Vincent, Mr .White etc. ..) monotonous, non-entertaining dialogues and violence is almost entirely absent. A film that at the end of the vision leaves you nothing, just so much boredom, long-winded and inconclusive.\nThis is not the Quentin that I love", "Tarantino Over-Indulges and the Audience Has to Pay for It": "It's official: Quentin Tarantino has gone so far up his own ass that there is no coming back. The director who created brilliant epics such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction has been replaced by a snivelling mess that merely lives off a name he has created for himself and spends his current career wanking over how great he thinks he is at everything.This film is a great example of everything that is wrong with a narrative, showcased by the lack of a struggle and happenstance achievements that are rewarded whilst underserved. On top of all that I watched probably an hour of what should actually have been the film and another hour and forty minutes of Tarantino meandering through moments in the lives of characters that actually have no reason to interweave and only join together in a sequence of events that are crude and tasteless.Once the film was over and I collected myself after enduring the whole plodding affair I was overcome with the realisation that I got nothing from the film. Nothing. Even the cheapest of films should leave you with something, a lesson, entertainment, a new perspective, whatever, just something. But not this film. This film had no value. Some entertaining moments here and there, but ultimately stale and cheap. Very cheap.", "BETTER than Typical QT": "I dreaded the length of this film & almost waited for DVD. I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it went b/c it is SO VISUALLY RICH & engaging. Admittedly slower pacing than expected from QT, but the pacing weaves a story & visuals that is ultimately rewarding. Perhaps 20-something's won't appreciate (1) the Hollywood & pop-culture nostalgia, (2) the brilliant music placement choices & (3) Leo's multi-layered, complex portrayal of a \"dying breed\" while simultaneously illustrating the character's shallow, short-sighted self-absorption -- VERY tough job to harness a character who is shown \"acting within the acting.\" QT is the master at showing us the most believable fantasy characters & re-imagining how they might interact with our historical realities. I was also dreading the violence b/c wondering how QT could possibly have the stones (and bad taste) to put the real-life murders on the big screen. Everyone knows QT films result in gruesome deaths, but this ending was SO BRILLIANT & satisfying (in a Tarantino way) -- a \"once upon a time\" tale that leaves you wishing it had happened that way in real life. See it on the big screen -- small screen inadequate for enjoying the tightly-packed scenery & depth of textures this film delivers.", "Another MASTERPIECE by Tarantino": "Best movie since PULP FICTION. Unpredictable with a very satisfying ending. Leo and Brad are SUPERB as are all the other actors. The 60's early 70's are brought back with amazing cinematography, the classic cars, signs, tv shows and the incredible movie clips etc. The movie stays with you and is even better after repeated viewings.", "The 60s in Hollywood as it probably was": "I enjoyed this film. It seems to me to show the seemier underbelly of Hollywood and the 60s. The glamour and counterculture emerge as fragile and coercive/opportunistic. The two parallel arcs of Dalton's career and Tate's are nicely contrasted. Di Caprio is the star of the show witha flawless acting performance. He is however almost upstaged by the young actress who plays the 8 year old Mirabelle! The star turns are also very good playing Sam Wannamker and Steve McQueen. My only problem with it is that I think it is way too long and needs tighter editing. Well worth seeing though.", "A Great time.": "This movie had me in the kind of mood that the big Lebowski would put you in. Tarantinos skills are on full display!

I don't understand why this film would warrant such a high rating and corresponding reviews. I think this is a case of emperor's new coat where people dare not say a Quentin Tarantino film is not worth watching or the ratings are fake (why would there be more than 8000 reviews pre-release)....There is hardly a story to follow in the film and little development in characters. Including signature shots of the director certainly did not save the film.I still encourage people who have the reaources to go and sit for 3 hours, then decide for yourself. But you have been forewarned.", "Worst tarantino movie ever": "Bottomline, the movie has no story, boring and unlike what was expected. The acting was phenomenal espically Brad pitt.", "Great!": "I'd heard mixed reviews about this film. I went in knowing it was going to be long, knowing there were going to be different story lines and knowing that it was a Quentin Tarantino film!The reality of Sharon Tate and the Manson Family mixed with the fictitious main story was great. The characters were excellent as were Leonardo, Brad and Margot Robbie. All the supporting actors were brilliant too, including Bruce Lee!I understand that some people won't 'get it' but if you did then you'll find that this film was different, entertaining, funny, violent- all the things you want from a Tarantino film.", "We Needed This": "I saw this film exactly a year ago now. I was sure to fly solo for the very first showing in a rather close seat. I saw it again with my fellow cinephile friend Evan in the top row, in the back. Then time went by, I moved, then I bought it on Amazon because the DVD's, for their own security, have remained stored, and none have been bought since Scorsese's Silence. I watched it twice thereafter. That was months ago. I watched it for the fifth time at 3am this morning. I have held off on writing a review until now.Critics have said that it's the first film by Quentin that isn't a genre film. But that's a very difficult thing to accept when none of his films conform to any single genre, and are completely devoid of formula. Let's settle on the fact that it's the first of his movies where the central characters are not professional criminals or killers in any way. Remember, Death Proof doesn't count, because it was only a toy movie, an installation in the art project that was Grindhouse.What truly, at its core, makes Once Upon a Time in Hollywood different from all of Quentin's other films is that it once again revolutionizes structure for a big-budget Hollywood film. The Thin Red Line was described as a hypnotic piece that had no real beginning or end, and to some extent, that is true of this unique film. The structure, frankly, is different from any film I can recall. The way he elapses time creates a kind of cinematic Ulysses.Quentin, like me, has a thing for on-screen duos. White and Orange. Jules and Vincent, Ordell and Louis, the Geckos, Sonny Chiba and Gordon Chu, Django and Schultz, Warren and Mannix. There's always got to be a pair. The thing is that most of the time, we expect one to be the second banana, the fill-in, the punchline. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt play a famous actor and his little-known stunt man, both perfectly suited for those roles, with an indelible dynamic that says more in a wordless two shot than most co-stars generate in a whole scene. And they, as Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth respectively, are not even on-screen together for all that many scenes. As fascinatingly deep as their rapport and their relationship are, they are still individuals too, worlds apart. And yet, the movie is bigger than that.Margot Robbie plays against the hype preceding the movie about portraying the tragic idol Sharon Tate, committing to a surprisingly oblique, adjacent place in the story. The movie is not told from an omniscient perspective. It is three days in the life of Rick and Cliff. Sharon is an extension of Rick's neighbor Roman Polanski's celebrity and aura. He and his right-hand man see her thusly. We dip in on her as a tertiary central character, but only to the extent that one can imagine the innocent young thrill of being a fledgling actor. Anyone who has been in a movie or has dreamt of it can claim not to be moved by Sharon giggling to herself at the audience reactions around her as they watch her in her latest release. But the movie is still bigger than that.Margaret Qualley is a breakthrough, a revelation, as is Dakota Fanning, pushing unflinchingly past her Man on Fire and War of the Worlds image straight into Squeaky Fromm. Al Pacino is back, which is one of the very few scrapes of positivity available in 2019, or '20 for that matter. And a star is born in Julia Butters, who plays a child ac-TOR with more wisdom and maturity than her over-the-hill macho co-stars could combine together.Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee in a scene that could never have been done today. And by that I mean, they were in fact done today, last year to be exact, but only a director with as powerful a following as Quentin. But if he did not exist, the window for this scene to have existed would have closed the day Bruce died. Such is the point of this entire lounging, nostalgically rambling epic. None of this would happen today, including how it is depicted. Whether Bruce was a vain blowhard or not was never the point, and never will be despite preposterously petty comparisons to yellowface and spitting on the grave of a legend and an icon. He remains the only real-life figure, depicted in a film littered with them to an extraordinary degree, to be criticized in regard to the ethics of his portrayal.It is because of everything in the great Kurt Russell's entire filmography, iconography and legacy that he appears briefly as a studio veteran with a life off-screen large enough to carry narration duty. We are treated to the brief shock of seeing Rebecca Gayheart in a deeply ironic role. We find great British Damian Lewis in an adequate rendition of Steve McQueen, though somehow the theory must have been more inspired than the execution. We get a parade of virtually a generation of movie stars' daughters from Harley Quinn Smith to Rumer Willis. They all have worlds of backstory and contextual reference behind them that no one could bask in in this movie without finding it still esoteric to some extent.Because the movie is bigger than that. All that. This is a film with a five-minute scene of Cliff feeding his beloved pit bull Brandy. This is a film with about five driving montages with Cliff alone, let alone Sharon and Roman. The movie is enormously comprised of characters going from one place to the next, always with the radio on. It's also enormously comprised of characters, period, real and made-up, filtered through recollections, recollections within recollections, movies and TV programs within the movie, also real and made-up.Quentin's camera, or Robert Richardson's camera, rather, is nothing but an unfettered eye that goes anywhere, sort of like a video game where the screen view can pass over walls or switch between any and all conceivable perspectives. It's a fluid, effortless mind's eye of recollection and imagination. And in true classic Hollywood fashion, the camera is almost always on a crane, following a conversation, climbing over a house and following a conversation with the neighbors.The movie is phenomenally overwhelmed by that principle, the video game-like ability to sprawl through this enormous world down to every little detail. Absolutely everyone watching this film will be flooded with references they will not notice or grasp. In fact, there are huge audiences directly drawn to see this movie---Manson buffs and true crime devourers eager to spot the nuances of accuracy and the breaks into make-believe, the true enormity of young and old Tarantino fans who will see a whole now world of his indulgences, the straddling extent of fans of the indomitably A-list megastar leads, car enthusiasts and foot fetishists---all of whom will sit down and be immersed with an experience that will still flood them with new exposures to other fascinations.Manson buffs don't necessarily watch auteur's pieces like this, that take you on such an exceptionally intoxicating cinematic ride. Young Tarantino fans will cry foul at deeply subjective and densely layered moments they won't entirely allow themselves to indulge enough to understand. Old Tarantino fans will eat up every little spot and crumb with a ladle, astonished that a movie this expensive and popular has so many wholly specific and obscure references to so many mediums, and hungry to devour even more little-known and forgotten films and music they even still hadn't yet discovered through his densely mythologized and powerfully sprawling body of work.With remarkably unheard-of scope, this unusually, hypnotically acute piece of art is defined and colored by a wall-to-wall fascination and immersion in every medium, fashion trope, advertising style, meal portion, thread count and bathroom tile.\nThere is a tremendous, loving and indispensably extraneous focus on neon signs, vintage car bodies burning rubber, billboard hits, radio DJ blab, commercials, dancing, backlots, and virtually any kind of transition carried to extravagant extremes. From cranes flying over whole streets or blocks to New Wave-style jump cuts. And Damian Lewis, who starred in the harrowing drama Keane, deserves no blame for the fact that Steve McQueen is more alive in the car stunts and driving sequences than his rather flat cameo, from the mundane spectacle of Pitt and Robbie cruising the scenic route to their destinations to Eurospy-style chase stunts shown from what seem to be sloppy Italian prints.Nostalgia is a powerful emotion, and in 2019 and '20, it is a desperately craved indulgence. We all have a version of this film in us, a pointillist sprawl of our favorite memories, the subjectivity of how it all felt and looked and sounded. Quentin may have been slowly building his mountain of material for years, but there is a special desire for this idiosyncratic brand of nostalgia, sentimentality and homesickness right now, a now we could hardly have foreseen just a few years ago. He is an absolute colossus in the annals of cinema, forever. He was born with his finger on the pulse of pop culture and its basest fixations and gratifications. Absolutely no one else could or would have made this movie. It is a fantasy that results in a miracle.", "Another snoozefest for the king of odd - time to retire this old race-horse": "QT has been on a losing streak for years. This is one more to add to the pile of boring, artsy films that will bomb and probably get some kind of award from Hollyweird: HATEFUL 8, DEATH PROOF, PLANET TERROR ... all unwatchable. This movie is slow up until the last 10 minutes. It is boring up until the last 10 minutes. Sure, great actors in every scene .. Leo and Brad and Kurt .. QT's favorites. They can all act but they don't have a lot to work with here. The funny parts are all in the previews. Then they take on the Manson disaster with humor? It is a swing and a miss by QT. Time to ride off into the sunset.", "another painting by Quinton Tarantino": "Movies like this cannot be understood by the 'Avengers' generation", "DiCaprio the one redeeming feature": "Leonardo DiCaprio does his best with the very weak script. Brad Pitt is boring. Story is dumb. On the whole this is a dumber than dumb film from a dopey director who likes to copycat scenes out of old movies, but does not have the intelligence to write great original stories that formed those original movies. What original scenes there are in 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' fall flat splat. The ending, however, is downright ridiculous.", "Acting makes this movie tolerable": "If it wasn't for the acting this movie was horrible. It just felt like it was going somewhere and never did. The scene that sort of brings the cast all together made little sense for what the movie was about. Felt like I watched a whole lot of nothing. Great acting", "Great acting, but plot a bit bland.": "Not Tarantino's best work, but definitely fun and entertaining.", "THE ACTING! and THE STORYLINE!": "I enjoyed every minute of this movie!! Definitely worth seeing. Everything about it was just perfect and this is now my third favorite Tarantino film!", "2 Glorious Male Lead Actors that Oscar Mandates As Impossible.": "Spoilers: Visceral, visual and stunning. As a child who rode horses at the Spahn Ranch a few times and remembering an old cowboy and the old western buildings all I can say is that this movie was near perfect. The way that Tarantino captured the era was spot on and his insertion spoofs of his previous films was gut busting at times. The Inglorious Bastards spoof with its reimagining of Nazi killings was just as pleasurable as the original film. The two hours and forty one minutes flew due to superb editing that always cuts off slightly sooner than you want it to.The most original editing I have watched since Momento, really. These horrific murders changed my childhood and all the kids who lived within a radius of the Spahn Ranch because we lost our previously allowed freedoms. If Tarantino says Hollywood is make believe then I admire him for making us believe there was a better ending to those horrible murders. So now we are left with trying to decide who was the leading male actor??? Impossible because Tarantino directed two perfect leads in a pas de deux of brilliance that has my brain exploding. Will Oscar bend the rules...", "Not like any other Tarrantino movies": "So this movie is quite unique.As its a version of history leading up to the events of Sharon Tate's death, played by Margot Robbie.First off, the story regarding Sharon Tate, is almost completely seperate from the characters that are focused on in this movie.We see snippets of her day to day life, but at no point does she mix with the main characters in Pitt and Dicaprio.Pitt and Dicaprio's characters really play as a filler story, to the end of the movie. This all becomes apparent towards the end.Overall, Pitt and Dicaprio's character seem unusually dull and boring. Sure Pitt's character has flashes of brilliance, but this is a 2 and half hour film, and those flashes are so far between. Dicaprio's character, is well, irrelevant nearly. He provides a few laughs, but he doesn't have much of an edge, which is weird being this is a Tarrantino movie. You keep expecting more from Pitt's character too, but then you just walk into the end of the movie, and then that's it.Apparently Dakota Fanning was in this movie. Don't even remember her...Overall, this is probably the worst Tarrantino movie I've ever seen, and I've loved all his previous work, besides Jackie Brown, which was also not good.", "Pretty boring": "No Tarantino dialogue. No real story line. Dumb ending.", "Hollywood on steroid": "Imagine Hollywood without Quentin Tarantino, This movie literally has everything from his previous movies, if you love masterpiece class movie this one desrve goes into your personal collection.", "Left the cinema before the end": "As a fan of Brad Pitt tried very hard to like this but after about 40 minutes could not watch anymore. The film was disjointed, jumping from scene to scene. The sound quality was poor could not tell what actors were saying. Of note I thought Damian Lewis was amazingly good at portraying Steve McQueen and the scene with Bruce Lee was quite funny.", "Once upon a time in '69": "It was a very personal film that perused 1969 Hollywood and all the aloof details of the industry. Filled with parallels only film enthusiasts can truly enjoy. All done with true cinematography depicting those times. I do not feel the movie was based off any character specially, rather utilizing those characters and their stories to trip thru Hollywood and what was happening at those times. Not for everyone, but for some a true masterpiece of story telling.", "Tarantino is a genius, but this is not his finest work": "Couldn't wait for this movie to come out since I'm a huge Tarantino fan, but unfortunately I was disappointed by it. The movie has no backbone (plot) at all and the dialogue is shallow... two things I thought I'd never write about a Tarantino movie. The acting is good and all technical aspects of movie-making are great as well, but the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere and for the first time during a Tarantino movie I found myself waiting for it to end instead of hoping for it to go on forever.", "Like being on location": "It's like these guys just went out on Hollywood Blvd and shot a film for fun. All the character we're likable and since it was a film about actors, they got to really try and act their best. The production value could have been better, but you do get the feeling of being there. Tarantino toned down the drive in nostalgia style and was able to make a smoothly flowing film that incorporates that style. It could have been a drawn out film where the villains and hero's get to know each other, and long scenes where they became friends then turned against each other later when the truth comes out about how they really are. It was cool though, grindingly as it was shot on the street.", "amazing movie": "Absolutely beautiful movie didn't expect it to be as good\nadvice everyone to watch it", "Headache": "I gave 3 star for 3 minor action scenes , and movie is seriously boring. The people who gave it 10 star are those who are showing off to the world that they know too deep about movie making and all. I always consider them as mentally Ill people cause they also say DCs justice league better than avengers. So you can have an idea about their taste. And I just watch because of its cast.", "First 2019 movie for Best Picture nomination": "This movie is Tarantino's best - an homage to 1960's Hollywood plus his revision of the Manson murders. Leonardo DiCaprio is great as a movie star who is on a downward slide and ends up playing in spaghetti westerns in Italy next an attempt to revive his career. Brad Pitt manages to be cool and sinister at the same time as DiCaprio's stunt double, best friend and major factotum. Plus his character owns the real star f the show - an incredible pit bull named Brandy who saves the day at the end of the movie.There's so much going on in this movie, that I had to see it twice to catch all the nuances. It will be even better streaming when we can stop the actin, or rewind it to catch quip that is missed. Tarantino shows his true genius as a director with this film.", "Somebody tell Quentin this is not his last film, please!": "A unique genre should be created for Tarantino's movies. This madman is a genius!This film has a very well put together script, remarkable editing and performances and a climax as only you can see in the Quentin Tarantino's filmography.The only thing that prevented me from seeing this movie was the length, but the last scenes are worth waiting for.It is a MUST SEE movie.PS: MCU, this is how you do a post-credits scene.", "Incredible": "Love this film. Di caprio and pitt and on top form. Margot robbie is amazing as always. Brilliant finale to the film too!", "Wake up and smell the coffee, Tarantino as the maturity of a six year old boy": "Why oh why do people think this overgrown film student can produce anything worth watching. He has lifted and plagiarised from the likes of the Cohen brothers and Woody Allen but learnt nothing. His ego, arrogance and self delusion is of immense proportions to force the viewer to sit through what was 2 hours forty of Tarantino w****k fest. For the hipsters out there who gave this film a high rating go out and find yourself a cool hobby like watching paint dry as it's certainly more interesting than watching this film, and far more enlightening.", "Once is enough": "This film defies expectation and defies conventional enjoyment too. With a very protracted run time and an undue interest in female feet.\nThe film is fascinated with its characters and their peripheral Hollywood lives. Sadly I thought that the characters as written and delivered required uniformly one note performances by every actor barring Leo DiCaprio who was required to extend the performance of his character at odd junctures of the films development. This style of piecemeal characterisation scenes is probably representative of the writer/directors approach but in this film the characters as written don't reward the actors or the film with any substance to grow a performance by.The plot and premise of 'Once Upon a Time.........' is threatened to overbalance as Tarantino's preference for sideways plots, dialogue and narrative pressure comes up against a really uninteresting overall treatment of the chosen subject matter.This seems to be because the film is not about anybody real at all. The depictions of every person and group, and therefore the play out of every character scene (and there are a lot of those.) are flimsily fanciful conglomerates of Tarantino's own past memories of the transitional period of American screen storytelling in the late 1960's and into the 70's.As there are no real individuals or groups of people within the films narrative that narrative is flabbily expended upon a distended \"interwoven stories\" plot vehicle.For example what do we know of Brad Pitts character? Within half an hour? And then by the end of the film?DiCaprio's character? Surely we've guessed everything about either of them very quickly, so they prove highly anaemic avatars for us to watch Tarantino's vista by.Those \"hippies\" that keep populating the film and irking various of our characters.....what are they trying to do? Where did they come from? What do they really believe? Answer to all these questions is \"nothing, no, nowt\" to all of the above. Above all, can we actually recognise then as the cult? The family? Members of whom will perpetrate the infamous killings.Tate, is she in this movie? No. An episode of her life (watching herself in a movie of hers at a local cinema) that's what's in the movie. Not her. I guess that Tarantino is familiar and fixated by this moment of her life due to it's inherent ability to convey sadness and sympathy for someone senselessly, tragically killed.In summation, if you are a member of the general audience, the entire film rests on the ability of the ensemble of characters and their interwoven lives lived to make sense of the world that Tarantino is marvelling at.These characters are far to dimly perceived and posited to adequately guide us into a film that is a fantasy scape 'otherworld' constructed of Tarantino's inimitable cultural memory and wistfulness; and therefore we, the general audience, are never sufficiently orientated or acculturated within this fantasy Film to extract anything like the dividends that I believe that Tarantino was trying to share with us.And that is the sticking point, because it is that world of Tarantino's mental making, drawn from his knowledge and memories of that transitional time, that is the subject of this film. The film is meditating on the death of an entire time period and it's associated paraphernalia. And in not killing Tate, in not allowing the multiple murders to transpire the film wallows in the glow of keeping alive, in memory, that lost entire world.Therefore the witheringly slim characters, with their lack of satisfying definition, drive, causation, resolution, development and consequence ultimately deny to us a satisfying viewing.This is all the sadder as this film achieves, and squanders, a truly brilliant level of technical and audacious film making by a genuine movie creator and inveterate movie fan in Tarantino.Of all the films that I have watched before, the film that I am drawn to compare this to the most is 'Vampyr' 1932, subtitled, 'The strange adventure of Allan Gray' which is described as \"leading the viewer, as though guided in a trance, through a realm akin to a waking dream, a zone positioned somewhere between reality and the supernatural.\"Whereas 'Vampyr' leads to a fantasy other-world scape of shadows, grey, mists and mires, 'Once upon a time.....' leads us into a fantasy 'never world' of glare, acrylic, marvellous hue and coloured tones but the experience of a voyage into a rare symbolic film is just as strong.Sadly the inability of the characters to help us there, to act as our true guides, utterly abrogates this film for us.", "How is this nominated for Oscar, beats me": "Too boring, fell asleep two times whatching this (not exaggerating, literally).\nDriving, driving, feet, feet, weird accents, feet...\nEnding is the worst part, just blah, over the top, cartoonish and it still managed to be boring.\nDuring the movie it looked like something's gonna happen, but no, nothing, I mean THEY JUST LIVE (drive and show feet) AND SOMEONE IS FILMING THAT.\nThen they introduce new characters so that you, again, naively think ooh somethings about to happen, but no, still nothing. This movie is just a big boring tease!\nIt is definitely the worst movie by Quentin Tarantino. It even looked like its not Quentin but someone trying to do a hommage to Quentin, some veery bad rip-off by young sophomore director student. Movie tries to create tension but is just plain boring, then at the end tries to shock audience but did not succeed.

(Once upon a time ... / and if ... the tragedy had not occurred.)\nAmazing and technical. What about DiCaprio's acting? worthy of Oscar. Brad? Amazing and very friendly. Margaret Qualley? revealing and excellent. Al pacino? Artistic and wonderful.\nOscar-worthy and awards film.", "Awfully disappointing": "Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio star in this movie about the glorious golden age of Hollywood with a gigantic budget and a veteran director who should know by now how to make a decent movie. What could go wrong??? Well, let me tell you this movie sucked to high hell in so many ways. I love nostalgic film. Particularly this era. That's why I'm so dissatisfied with this piece of crap flick. There's no real plot. The characters do things for no apparent reason. Nonsensical things happen that have no purpose later in the film. And there's a scene with Leo when he's in his actors trailer that almost made me walk out of the theater for how long and pointless it was (they cut it by 2/3 in the tv version). I've seen grade b films like say Van Nuys Blvd or The Room that have redeeming quality but this has none. Don't waste your time.

Obviously the protagonist had to be an actor who got to bring the prop flamethrower home. He put in a few more nostalgic scenes from the golden age of Hollywood and there ya go: A script only a guy who didn't know who QT was, would reject. So far in my life I have been saying that when either Denzel or Quentin was involved in a movie it was a must watch. Guess it's only Denzel now...

At some point I got bored about the actors and was not living the moment with them, but the end scene was so great I forgot about the boring beginning.\nOverall is a good movie, but I know (and we all know) Tarantino could do much better.\nAs from my point of view the story our beloved producer took as a raw version for his movie is not interesting, or at leas it was not showed in a interesting way in the final movie.\nLast, but not least, I advise you to go watch this movie in theaters, but if you are out of money right now you can wait till the DVD release as you will not miss that much.

Brad Pitt acting was subtle and cool, DiCaprio's role was the emotional and delicate,, Margot Robbie took the innocent and hopeful part ...

That he is able to assemble a great cast driven by their love of the craft, by their want to make a good movie once in a while. This movie, therefore, will have no mainstream appeal. Teenagers won't get it. But this is a good movie for adult viewers, who have a hint of intellect.\nWe live in a cruel world. Humans do terrible things to each other and in real life, it may be difficult to influence this. But I love how Tarantino takes a revenge on hateful humans in his latest movies. He goes 110% Tarantino on their asses - applying a pair of pliers and a blow torch:) Nazis, white supremacists, fanatics... they may be taking over the world, they may be getting in a way of normal people living their normal lives, but in this world of movies we can turn tables on them and we will, we will get medieval on their asses:)\nThank you Quentin for this movie!", "I heard the original cut was 4 hours long": "I could have sat through more of that, every shot was so strategic and perfectly thought out.

The first one - this film is a bit too long, I was waiting and waiting and waiting for something tarantino-ish to happen and I had to wait two hours to finally truly enjoy it.The second problem - I felt like I did not understand the point of the protagonist Rick Dalton's character arc. He seemed well written, but not crucial character for this film, his storyline was deep, but in essence had no real point. Other characters seemed much more interesting to me.", "Film Review: Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood/www.nightfilmreviews.com": "Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is one thing and one thing only; Quentin Tarantino's beautifully crafted dreamy love letter to cinema!With his newest feature, the current master of cinema's vision reminds us why movies are cool again. For the first time, in a long time, there's a film that begs to be seen, not in the comfort of your own home, not on your Netflix cue on an airplane, but in front of a silver screen, with an audience and you're right...some popcorn. Once Upon A Time is less a film and more an experience; one where the bustling hot summer days are corrected by the high intensity air conditioning of the multiplexes; one where the theatres are a safe haven for summer love and first kisses, an experience where going to the movies is as magical as popping your cherry. That's what a Tarantino film is like; just like when I first went to go see his Grindhouse experience for the first time, Tarantino is a visionary old soul, hell bent on sharing his memorable cinematic experiences of his past, with us today.If you are a cinephile and don't know about Quentin Tarantino's work, most, if not all people will tell you that you should just quit now, but I digress. Tarantino worked at a blockbuster in Hollywood, California in his early years, consuming as much cinema as possible. One of his most revered quotes to date about film is his famous line that \"When people asked me if I went to film school I tell them no. I went to films\". Funny enough, this quote captures the essence of Tarantino and his canon; an individual who entered the world of cinema out of the sheer love of watching films, just like myself.As an artist myself and lover of film, I never went to film school also. Hopefully, as someone who would eventually love to make their own films one day, I feel that this is one of the many reasons why I admire, as well as, so heavily identify with Tarantino. I also learned about films by watching them. Just like myself, the influence in Tarantino films is wide ranging. His largest inspirations draws from the New Wave Gangster pictures of France, crafted by the likes of Jean Pierre Melville, Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. All of the names listed are absolute giants in celluloid and contributed in my opinion the most to modern cinema that features, as Godard would say, \"A girl and a gun\". According to Godard, that is pretty much all that is necessary to making a good motion picture. Other notable Influences on Tarantino would be essentially any film from the 1970's because that is the era when he began to understand and study cinema, an era of films by Don Siegel, Sergio Leone and George Roy Hill.Yet while many are quick to label QT as a scam artist and artistic thief, I feel like it is my duty to rectify that notion. Before continuing on, it has to be said that art copies art, inspiration inspires and according to Mark Twain, there is no such thing as originality, only levels of authenticity. Therefore, it is my extreme pleasure to introduce and name QT a master of authenticity for his cinema. Just like when Sergio Leone remade a Kurosawa picture and developed it into the Dollars trilogy, or when Christopher Nolan gave his interpretation of the Dark Knight recently, or when Martin Scorsese won his first Oscar for remaking a Japanese film and later naming it The Departed, art is not our subject, WE are its subject. Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is the iconic director's masterful indulgence in everything that he loves about movies and everything we should love, too!Aside from Taratino, Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood isn't just one man's magnum opus, but a collection of so many talented artists, starting with its cast. The film opens with Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt going for a cruise to a watering hole. Dicaprio stars as Rick Dalton, a good ole' boy from Missouri who drinks for hydration and smokes for oxygen. Once the leading man in television and film, appearing in western serials, one aptly titled Bounty Law, Dalton is on the tail end of his acting career. The Midwestern-American cowboy style Dalton knew all too well, is being suffocated and changed, no thanks to the foreign influenced, free-loving hippie movement. While DiCaprio's Dalton emits a certain swagger that charms many, the audience comes to realize that this 'swagger' is less a personality trait and more a clearly stubborn, unchangeable style and resilience to the conforming of the times around him. According to Rick, Rick Dalton is still big; it's the pictures that just got small. While it may be hard to argue this notion, DiCaprio's riotous as the comedic force of the film. Blending well with Tarantino's signature writing style for a second time, DiCaprio's Dalton stutters, stammers and then collectively pulls himself together in front of a camera. DiCaprio shows vulnerability constantly through induced breakdowns which is such a breath of fresh air from the usual leading roles we have seen DiCaprio play, yet also portrays the perfectly balanced and well-to-do movie star, we have come to expect from the actor, and all his character thus far.Yet, as good as DiCaprio is, the clear cut favourite of Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is easily the most underrated actor work today...and that's Brad Pitt. Pitt plays Cliff Booth, Dalton's best friend, stunt double and, essentially, life coach. Keeping Rick on an even keel on the daily, Cliff also serves as Rick's driver thanks to many of Rick's drunken nights that end at the end of a street lamp. Booth opposite to Dalton emits something Dalton never could, and that's an unaccepting Hollywood confidence. You know that confidence where \"you're a movie star but don't want to be a movie star, but no matter what you do to deny it, you're still a movie star\" type swag? The type of swag where you kick the heck out of Bruce Lee and live to tell the tale? Yea, that's Cliff Booth. Booth's swagger is a type of cool that cannot be tampered with or broken; essentially playing the type of friend that any person and everybody would want to have. Yet, the contrasts between the two can't be any more cinematically indulgent. In one of the best and most gratifying scenes in the film, is seeing the contrast of living between the two pals. Dalton, who lives in the Hollywood Hills, in a beautiful mansion, with a pool and famous neighbours in a well to do neighbourhood is pitted against Booth's lifestyle, a lifestyle that involves living inside of a Drive-in trailer, having an adorable yet deadly dog, and wearing a Hawaiian shirt as if its the most iconic costume design of 2019.While Booth and Dalton are both a duo one may soon not forget, Tarantino was quick to point out that Pitt and DiCaprio were going to be a duo similar to the likes of Robert Redford and Paul Newman, who were ironically dominating cinema around the time that Hollywood takes place. Thanks to the release of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in the late 60's and The Sting released in the early 70's, it was no doubt that the two were a match made in heaven. Yet, while this was a self-proclaimed statement made by Tarantino himself, perhaps just as a form of publicity for the film, or just pure Tarantino bravado behaviour, its hard to disagree with his statement at all. Pitt and DiCaprio are a cinematic dream team!Yet, despite all its male glory, the true hero of Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is Sharon Tate played elegantly by Margot Robbie.While many casual moviegoers may go into Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood without knowing much about the history of Hollywood, Sharon Tate or the Manson family murders, they may come out quite upset, disappointed or underwhelmed with the film. Aside from the fact that first half of the film is basically an elaborate introduction to all the characters, Tarantino takes his time with the process obviously dragging it out for the sheer pleasure of it, a la Once Upon a Time in the West by the masterful Sergio Leone. Yet, his story is glued and always will be linked to Sharon Tate, the late actress who faced an unfortunate, real world fate early on in her life. Yet, despite all this tragedy and grief, Tarantino's Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood may easily be recognized as a love letter to cinema, but deep down, the film is a love letter to a lost star who never really was given her opportunity to share her true potential, and left the world much too early. The Valley of the Dolls actress was a clear inspiration to the auteur, and it is no doubt that, this one was clearly for her.Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood continues the trend of exercising the idea that, this is Tarantino's world, and we are all just living in it. Constant pushing the boundaries of the medium, and rigorously pushing the limits of reality, truth with fact or fiction, grit and pulp, Tarantino creates his own elaborate world with whomever he chooses, however he fashions it to be. Luckily for us audience members, we are able to take a glimpse of some amazing performances, even if it is for mere second, of actors we love and appreciate regularly. Like any good Tarantino film, the likes of new faces and familiar ones flood the screen, including Al Pacino, playing Marvin Schwarzs, a movie producer who sees Rick as a diamond in the industry who simply needs a good polish and update with the times. Marvin proposes that Rick goes to Italy to film a spaghetti western, paralleling the real life history of Hollywood at the time with Clint Eastwood shooting the Dollars films in Rome with Sergio Leone that catapulted Eastwood to stardom.", "Tarantino Underwhelms": "Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are my favorite Tarantino movies, followed by Django Unchained. This film is a scattered shot and fable version of Charles Manson and his followers. Brad Pitt won the Best Actor Academy Award playing a stunt double of Leonardo DiCaprio's western star. They cross paths with the Manson girls in 1969 and this leads to Quentin's usual blood bath. There are some entertaining moments throughout the two and a half hours but overall I was disappointed in Tarantino's latest entry.", "Great and really entertaining but one of his weaker films": "Amazing movie with once again great writing and directing from Quentin Tarantino and great acting. Brad Pitt a stunt double Cliff Booth easily steals the show delivering the most laughs. The same thing goes for Leonardo DiCaprio being also great as washed-out Hollywood actor Rick Dalton who is slowly losing his place in Hollywood. All of the actings is great with other good performances from Al Pacino and Dakota Fanning.It's 1969 during the late stages of Rick Dalton's acting career who acted in an old canceled tv western Bounty Law with his stunt double Cliff Booth. During this time Rick Dalton is starting to feel worried he is no longer a relevant actor in Hollywood. We follow him on his journey with his stunt double Cliff Booth to try to become relevant again. The film also very loosely takes place during the Manson family murders and we see a few of his cult followers roaming around Los Angles with them living on an old ranch.Another thing the movie does right is the set design and nice cinematography by Robert Richardson. It actually feels and looks like 60s Los Angeles with old fashioned drive-in theaters and the music choices. On top of having cool movie and tv references of the 60s decade\nin the movie.\nTarantino's writing is as always really good and creative in the use of foreshadowing. Showing us as the audience something like an object then having it come up again way later in the film. With a good purpose in the movie of subtlety showing us it.\nHowever, the story of the movie is overall a little weak at times. In the sense that not much happens in the movie during the second act its main characters sitting around talking which is both a strength and weakness of the film due to Tarantino's writing. Another issue is the character of Sharon Tate well being acted good by Margot Robbie she doesn't really do much in the film until the third act. If you would have left her character out of the movie it really wouldn't impact the film much at all.\nOverall Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a great movie with amazing acting. This movie shows us that Tarantino is still is a brilliant writer and director still capable of making great memorable movies. Even if this is one of his weaker films storywise.", "Masterful": "Entertaining and satisfying. This film doesn't make you feel like you sat through a three hour movie.", "Underwhelming": "Now if you don't know the real story, you won't understand the twist that he pulls of at the end.\nThat is it's weakness among other things\nI get what he was going for but honestly i personally feel that it falls flat.", "There was simply no story!": "I was waiting for the plot and the actual story all the time. And when there was some action starting, the film was over within 5 minutes. I didn't get what is so impressive about it.", "It should have been so much better !": "You have a top Director, three of the best looking stars in the business, who can also act, and one of the most compelling stories of the 1960's. Why Tarantino chose to end it in a similar way to Inglorious Basterds, and even Django, I will never know. Yes revenge fantasies are nice, but after awhile, you begin to wonder is that all you can do ?\nHaving said that the acting is good, as is the Production Design, Cinematography, and the Soundtrack is excellent. The plot on the other hand seems to be all over the place meandering between Leo's actor, Brad his Stunt Double, and Sharon Tate. But most of these characters remain sadly underdeveloped, with Leo's being most.\nI really don't mind involving fictional characters in real events, but there is a lot of material in the events themselves, that could easily fill a movie.", "Over-marketing": "If a movie maliciously discredits another person (no matter what race or status), it's fine not to show it.\nAfter watching this movie, I know the best way to deal with the mid-life crisis:Carry forward the advantages and continue to work hard. It is better than being able to compare. It is not too long to pretend to be able to compare.", "It's a \"once upon a time\"....": "A lot of people who've seen this movie felt annoyed because they expected a movie about the Tate murder, but they got a movie about a nobody doing mediocre TV shows and spaghetti westerns.Yet I feel that's the main point of the movie! Bear with me.Sharon Tate was a \"nobody\" when she got killed. She really hadn't yet her big break, while described as a promising prospect. You see her walk into a movie theater and no one recognizes her, but at the same time you get to see the audience react positively to her scenes. Unfortunately, she has been \"famous\" because of her untimely and horrifying demise. As a viewer, you know that already and that's what you are expecting to see.Yet what you get to watch is the loser life of washed up actor Rick Dalton and his nervous breakdowns. He is an actor, although with potential, he just hasn't made it. He's Tate's next door neighbor, and daydreams about meeting her and her husband (Roman Polanski) and maybe getting his big break. But that has never happened.Watching his life seemed boring, maybe even sad, but you are not interested because you know Tate's story is way more interesting. But QT never gives you more than glimpses of \"the celebrity\" you went in to see to her story.Then the final act kicks in, you are led to believe \"here we go, the murder is coming up now\" and this is where history is changed and the rug is pulled from underneath your feet. Instead of attacking Tate's home, the Manson clan attack Rick's house. And instead of getting killed, Rick, his stuntman friend and his dependable dog beat the s*** out of them. And guess what, only after this incident does Tate perceive his presence and invites him into his house! Only then and there does Rick's story became more interesting to Tate, and more importantly to you as a viewer.Now ask yourself this, Would you have been interested in Tate's life if she hadn't been murdered? Would she even have become a \"star\" or would she have been forgotten like a thousand \"promising\" others? How would have her life changed if she was attacked but survived?Rick's long-awaited chance for a \"big break\" only materialized when he was attacked by a bunch of hippies. He's probably going to be famous for it and will probably \"get a movie made about his life\"! From QT's dark POV, Rick Dalton's story could have been Tate's story. It's a \"what if\" story, it's a \"once upon a time\".This movie is a timepiece about hollywood, but not just the songs and the neon lights and the colorful outfits. It's about the cinema capital of the world, where being a good actor is just not enough to make you a \"star\". You learn hollywood's harsh ironic reality, and along the way you'll know that you (the moviegoer) are who made it that way.", "Once upon a time...": "Tarantino used to make good films.I suppose he had some vision with this film, which I myself do not understand. I kept waiting for the punchline. There isn't any.I suppose the \"surprise\" is that the ending is not what you expect, giving Sharon a different ending to only wish for.It is a movie about Hollywood, but lacking any genius. DiCaprio and Pitt were truly fantastic in this bland script that led to nowhere.", "Absolutely great film": "I enjoyed that a lot. I literally had no idea what to expect going into this, I didn't even read the bio for it I just went straight into it. I was very confused at first but then it all came together. Brad Pitt and Leo worked very well as best friends. That's definitely a film I could watch again. I highly recommend this to everyone. It didn't feel as long as it is, which is perfect.As I said I watched it again and I originally had it at an 8 but I've bumped it to a 9. It's better the second time you watch it, I highly recommend. I also think Leonardo's acting performance is criminally underrated in this and not talked about enough.", "#ryzarektorownview": "Once upon a time in ... hollywood;* Quentin made another cool film, No another way with such a caste)\n* Certainly not the bloodiest movie in TCU.

You would get the same reaction from some: \"too long\" \"too boring\" \"nothing happens\". Not every film is for everyone. This film is meant to entertain those who've seen a lot of movies and appreciate Hollywood's history. Seeing the old neon signs of landmarks that are no longer there, the beautiful artwork of movie posters on every street, the colorful clothes and styles - the attention to detail is a result of love. No wonder QT decided to make a western TV series after this. Hearing him talk so much about the Virginian and how great the old westerns were really shows in this movie. And, the ending is exactly what I thought he would do - there's no rule that says you need to make a film about the past historically accurate unless you claim it to be. This is a well made movie without a doubt.", "Uncommonly Entertaining Alternate History": "I can't say how folks born in the 80's and beyond will feel about this flick. It is such a nostalgic look at the late sixties culture grafted on to an outrageous real murder turned on its head here in a creative alternative way.What works without question is the attention to period kitsch, music, and a wicked lampooning of the rise of the unabashed self-important Hollywood art community of actors and directors breaking up the old studio stranglehold. There will be blood, a whole lot of it if \"Charlie's Angels\" (& one particular Devil) extract a psychopathic warped justice.So it ain't really even comparable to Pulp Fiction. It takes a kind of old story of star whose career is flagging and then goes on more than a single interesting turn, several in fact.As expected dialog is sharp, but it is more visual and...funny as a result. This is a homage to a time and an industry as well as poking lots of fun at the whole ridiculous nature of these self-indulgent folks with their heads up their @$$e$.

This is the first movie I've seen in the theater that actually put me to sleep, and I suffered through Hellboy.

I agree with carlvan1977. This is a move for an older audience, and probably limited to Americans.I watched this film in the UK, and I don't think the Brits really got it.For me, born in '69, it scratches all the itches: the gorgeous cars, the radio ad for Noxema, the smoking, the sideburns, the ice cube tray where you had to pull the handle, the wood panelling, Green Hornet.... if you were there then, it takes you right back,Neil Diamond !! The soundtrack just takes me to my parents playing pool in the basement.I don't care about the plot holes and the baggy second act ( the ranch scene DOES drag on, so go for a pee break during that one ). We watch TV with Rick and Cliff and the old wood surround fills the screen, so all is forgiven,The re-imagining of an evil event gave me solace, and I think that's what QT wanted for himself.It's epic.See it on the big screen and indulge in reminiscence of times gone.", "Severed thumbs up.": "I think it was Jay Bauman who jokingly named Quentin Tarantino the last real filmmaker left, in the sense that his films get big openings without being unnecessary remakes, unnecessary sequels, and/or superhero products.

You can tell from the vintage poster and old-school Columbia Pictures logo what sort of era he delves into this time.Less outwardly \"wacky\" than Tarantino's usual output, but nonetheless witty and gritty, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (or Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood if you'd like to use your ellipses properly) focuses on a famous actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt man (Brad Pitt) in 1960's La La Land, whose lives interweave with the gruesome case of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and the Manson family. Critics have said that this film does to the Manson killings what Inglourious Basterds did to World War II. I believe I enjoyed this one more.The most prominently featured members of the infamous family are Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), Tex (Austin Butler), and Squeaky (Dakota Fanning). Damion Herriman plays Charles, reprising the role after also portraying him on Mindhunter. This is in addition to the screen celebrities and Hollywood figures of the era, themselves portrayed by exquisite actors.We see Timothy Olyphant as James Stacey of Lancer fame, Mike Moh as Bruce Lee (my favorite performance in the film), Bruce Dern as a rancher who would rent out his farm for the shooting of Westerns (it later became a Manson family hideout), and the late Luke Perry as Wayne Maunder. Jay Sebring, another known victim of the Mansons, is played by Emile Hirsch, and original characters are performed by the likes of Kurt Russell, Julia Butters, and Jack & Jill survivor Al Pacino. There are other cameos worth mentioning, but doing so would take a while. In terms of Hollywood nostalgia, this film satisfied me in ways 2016's Hail Caesar did not.Our two leads, Western serial star Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and body double Cliff Booth (Pitt), are not among the film's real-life figures, although their friendship is modeled after that of Burt Reynolds and his long-time stunt double Hal Needham; we meet them at a time where the Golden Age is ending and the Rick Dalton type heroes are no longer in fashion. The events on which this story is based are highly fictionalized, of course, but great care has been taken to recreate the era, mimic its filmmaking, and getting so much else right. I read that Margot Robbie did extensive research on Sharon Tate's life, without ever having to get within talking distance of Roman Polanski (wise).Tarantino's actors, in general, are killing it as usual. This is one of those times where Brad Pitt gets to play something other than Brad Pitt and create a believable, entertaining presence. Robbie is even more wonderful, as is easy to forget when you remember her as \"that girl who played Harley Quinn so poorly that hundreds of white girls cosplayed the bejeezus out of her\". DiCaprio is magnificent, both as Dalton and as the heroes and villains Dalton is hired to play.In addition to great and well-acted characters, as well as Tarantino's signature grit (when necessary), the movie is also meticulous in terms of its camera work, editing, authentically \"Sixties\" production design (same goes for the makeup and hairstyling of Robbie), and choice of music, plus some other things heard on the radio at the time; the soundtrack has been called an \"oft-disquieting mixtape of golden-age rock'n'roll, radio DJ patter, and period-specific commercials\". It is touches like these that make a QT movie a highlight of any movie year. Does it need to be quite this long? Perhaps not, but even the seemingly inessential scenes have something that sticks out.One of his less enjoyable QT trademarks, depending on who you ask, is the apparent foot fetish. And nowadays, as it turns out, he doesn't even seem to care if the feet in question have been washed or not. Keep this in mind, but do please watch this movie just the same. 'Tis important to separate the art from its salivating foot fetishist.", "A big hit in my opinion, might not be for everyone": "I understand that this movie might not be for everyone.\nIt has kind of a \"slow\" build up, which I personally like, but might not be your cup of tea.\nAlso, if you're not familiar with Tarantino's type of violence in movies, some scenes might be a little weird and over the top.\nThat said, if you like Tarantino's humor and style... you'll love this! Just like I did.\nLeonardo DiCaprio's performance is outstanding and I'm pretty sure that this could get him another Oscar nomination in 2020.\nBrad Pitt is hilarious in this movie. I absolutely loved his character.\nAll the other actors are remarkably good as well.\nThe brilliant performances combined with the great cinematography made this movie an absolute winner for me.\nA must-see!", "Feast for the eyes more than a solid story": "I was a bit worried before seeing this one knowing it was just about shy of three hours. And its all there. The long scenes that doesn't lead anywhere and the plot is not super strong. I believe in order to appreciate this film you really must be a big film lover. I think the haters want a solid story with fast progress whereas the other half enjoys the details and the fantastic 1969 hollywood-universe Tarantino presents. Just beautiful. And Pitt and DiCaprio really hit it out of the park as do most of the other actors aswell. I enjoyed it even if the story is a bit weak. So if you are looking for a strong classic story this is not the film for you.", "Tarantino needs to retire": "Before I begin, I want to say that Pulp Fiction and True Romance are two of my favorite movies of all time.But it has been a slow decline in Tarantino films since then, with Once Upon A Time In Hollywood being his official Jump The Shark moment. I know he said he wants to do 10 films before he retires and I hope he can do something for #10 to spare himself from this cringe worthy embarrassment and give himself some sort of Swan Song.This film is horrible, if it didn't have DiCaprio and Brad Pitt and a Manson story to distract from the monotony, I don't know how anyone could withstand it. I don't even know where to begin as far as what makes it bad, basically everything does. With the exception of DiCaprio, Pitt, Al Pacino and Bruce Dern (and a couple others with tiny parts) the acting is truly horrific. I blame this on the directing. It's truly cringe worthy. Leo is fantastic as always, but what else is expected there. And Pitt is fun because he's Pitt.There is no plot, the script is terrible, the music is dreadful, it's just horrible. And this is coming from a Tarantino fan. People who are saying this is a 10 (or anything above a 5) either must not get out much or they are devoted and brainwashed Tarantino fans. Or maybe they just hate hippies and love seeing them get socked in the face. I don't know what it is, but this movie is atrocious, an embarrassment to film making, and the title is ironic because I remember when Quentin Tarantino made great films once upon a time in Hollywood.", "Hollywood lovea movies about Hollywood": "In their way of glorifying their own industry, Hollywood loves when movie makers makes movies about themselves. Look... it's an actor acting to show how hard it it to act. Bravo! Let's give him an Oscar.", "Wow! This movie was extremely NOT AMAZING!": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is, by far, the most pointless, meandering, excruciatingly un-entertaining work of the usually reliable master, Quentin Tarantino! Only a handful of good-to-very good performances save this unintentional \"disaster film\" from complete worthlessness! Fortunately for the picture, one of those performances is by one of its stars, Brad Pitt, who is consistently watchable and entertaining throughout, even as the film he inhabits so often isn't! Pitt's fellow co-lead, Leonardo DiCaprio is barely memorable (and not even particularly good) as a character who isn't especially likeable, or compelling, anyway! Most telling of DiCaprio's shortcomings in the film is the way he easily gets his \"thespian clock\" cleaned by a then-9 year old actress, Julia Butters, who dominates scenes with him with a seemingly effortless, naturalistic style (seriously, she is one of the best things about the film)! Also very good is the gorgeous Margaret Qualley (Andie MacDowell's real-life daughter) who plays a comely hitchhiker who brings an unsuspecting Pitt into contact with several Manson family members! The fight scene between Pitt and \"Bruce Lee\" was also entertaining, yet these are all mere moments in a largely overstuffed, hapless mess of a picture! Also, conspicuously absent from the film is writer Tarantino's gift of creating memorable, quotable, dialogue! Not only is the movie crafted in a blandly disposable way, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has precious little of the inspired genius that has profoundly uplifted so many other Tarantino films before it!", "Masterpiece 10/10": "Went to see this with some friends and everyone of us felt QT nailed it, captured the period to perfection, brilliant music, an amazing cast and the acting was on another level. The chemistry between Leo and Brad is worth the admission alone, and Margot although underused was a worthy addition, the Manson clan make up the cast in a very creepy fashion until all their stories come to clash at the films brilliant last third, probably best to do your research on the time period to get the most from what I'm sure will go down as a future masterpiece, look out for the many many cameos from a Hollywood who's who.

Me being a fan of all of Tarantino's movies + the amazing cast this movie had sold it for me instantly. All the set and costume designs were amazing, but they don't really mean much without plot. This movie was just a compilation of boring scenes about an actors every day life. None of these scenes really drove the story anywhere and felt overall dry without any main conflict. Leo's character wasn't really likeable and everyone else besides Brad Pitt felt flat. The Mansons were extremely underused because all of their scenes were the only ones I enjoyed watching. I really tried to like this movie but there wasn't much to take from it. Also, what's up with all those shots of feet my man Tarantino freaky.", "Once Upon A Time In The Dream Factory.": "Since he signed up for a Limitless Odeon card a few weeks ago,a friend has been wanting me to come along to a screening. Having found Tarantino's past work to always at least be interesting, I came along for this Once Upon A Time tale.View on the film:Crystallising the era, writer/directing auteur Quentin Tarantino reunites with cinematographer Robert Richardson and builds an exquisite re-creation of the era, buzzing with original TV ads/radio spots in the background to the glittering long tracking shots down the streets of LA, creating an immense atmosphere, on the same level as the GTA games.Closing this fairy tale with a tranquillity final shot to the gates of New Hollywood opening, Tarantino gleefully dishes out a final of excessive violence,and a gaze for foot fetish that have been motifs since the start, but places the focus in building from The Hateful Eight (2015-also reviewed) in crafting a lingering mood piece of long-take crane and dolly shots,which let's viewers breath in the sights,sounds and friendships of the era.Both working with Tarantino for a second time (and backed by a incredible supporting cast) Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt give brilliant turns as Dalton and Booth, thanks to the worn down state of Dalton,and the fading glint of Hollywood glamour from Booth's eyes,being bounded in the relaxed, casual style Pitt and DiCaprio give the friendship. Watching her latest film at the cinema, Margot Robbie gives a joyful, care-free turn as Sharon Tate, embracing the fairy tale of the Dream Factory once upon a time in Hollywood.", "Worth writing my first review!!!": "This movie was amazing. Besides the ensamble cast etc, the cinematography is amazing, it feels like you are in the late 1960s.The Dalton character is amazing and shows the level of skill Dicaprio has as an actor, but also the level of skill in creating the character and directing him. Dicaprio goes from Dalton to various characters he plays with ease. He gives you and inside and heartwrenching inside the head view of Daltons failing actor character.Pitt plays his sidekick amazingly and shows how devout he is to his boss. He sticks by his side and he is the real hero in the movie. He is tough, yet subservient to Dalton, which is quite thought provocking. In the end Booth (Pitts character) saves the day in a twisted alternate ending. A kind of what if Tate and her friends weren't killed by the Manson Family.I'm a sucker for justice and seeing the good guy win. So this alternate reality ending was mind blowing. That was the real genius, taking a true story and giving it a good ending.The after Booth saves the day Dalton in his delusion comes and takes all the credit. As he is the Actor in the limelight, getting paid the big bucks, this is the hand which he was dealt and Booth although the true hero was never destined to get the same lot in life as Dalton.The humor at the end when Tate knows Dalton and his movies and Dalton is so flattered is a greater closer to a visually stunning, well written, well acted movie.", "Squintin' Tendertino": "By now, we all know Quentin Tarantino is a genius of his craft. Even if you are not one for the excessive violence expected in the third act of his films, there is much to be appreciated in the terrific dialogue and well-designed set pieces. Tarantino's ninth work (he considers Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 to be one film) is no different in these regards. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is an amalgamation of three storylines following actor Rick Dalton's (Leonardo DiCaprio) struggle with has-been syndrome; his stuntman and best friend, Cliff Booth's (Brad Pitt) minor adventures waiting for Rick to finish shooting and his interest in one of the Manson girls; and Sharon Tate's (Margot Robbie) lavish lifestyle leading up to the date of her infamous murder by members of the Manson cult. It has all the Tarantino signatures, but two things stand out as unique to this film: its relationships and its scenery.Despite the film's grisly inspiration, Once Upon a Time is Tarantino's most tender work. Never before in his films has a relationship between characters been so loyal and \"bromantic\". DiCaprio and Pitt's chemistry comes off the screen as incredibly real. Cliff Booth has always been second to Rick Dalton and is treated like an assistant when he is not needed for Dalton's stunts, but there is never a point where we doubt their friendship and Booth's loyalty. These characters are very well rounded and, through all the flashbacks and dialogue, we understand why they keep each other around. Dalton was the only one who stuck by Booth after his wife died in a mysterious fishing accident. Whether he did it or not is up to the viewer in a surprisingly quick and comedic flashback, but most people with whom he comes into contact assume he killed her. Now, for Rick it is nothing as serious, but Cliff is always there to cheer him up after producers and directors remind him of his failures or try to encourage him to sell out. It is proven to the audience time after time that the two are inseparable. That is, until the start of the film's third act with a time jump and a chin-quiver-inducing scene while the two were at dinner. The fact that I cared so much for this relationship was quite surprising and made me question at points if what I was watching was even a Quentin Tarantino film.The film also approaches the character of Sharon Tate and the events of the Manson murders with respect and caution. Instead of depicting Tate as just the inevitable victim of the Manson family, we get a glimpse into her personal life as a rising star in Hollywood. We get to see her rocking out to Paul Revere & The Raiders in her bedroom and going to see her new movie, The Wrecking Crew, with a regular audience on a sunny afternoon and barely get noticed by the box office attendant or the crowd. Tarantino really tries to make Tate's scenes about her and not about the Manson family. Margot Robbie puts on an excellent performance here and actually disappears into her role.Once Upon a Time also features tremendous shots of old time Hollywood. You can tell that Tarantino obsessed over this aspect of the project because there are so many thoughtful details in the scenery. Watching the film, we get to explore locations from Sunset Boulevard to the Playboy Mansion. It is not the places he shows us, but the way he shows us that is so striking about the film. He brings the background to the foreground and makes the set pieces the star of the show. There may be just two people on the screen, but it is the setting that is the camera's focus showing every precise detail put into recreating 1969 Los Angeles. You'll be squinting at the screen as Cliff drives Rick's Coupe de Ville throughout the city or as Sharon Tate and Roman Polanksi head to dinner to take in as much of the scenery as possible. Some of this detail includes an expert re-creation of Spahn Movie Ranch and even the adult theater that would later become Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly Cinema.Although this film takes much longer to get to Tarantino's trademark violence and may move slow at times, the ending is 100% worth the almost three hour build up. The film's ending both warmed my heart and boggled my mind. You can tell that Tarantino's most recent endeavor is the film he has always wanted to make. He included his signature dialogue and outrageous violence; but he also gave himself the opportunity to geek out over Hollywood nostalgia, show viewers everything he is capable of as a seasoned director, and once again rewrite history. With the welcome additions of a well-realized friendship between the film's two main characters and the respectful treatment of its characters, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is certainly Quentin Tarantino's most tender work and it may just be his best.", "Too long and boring": "It's way too long and boring til the last 10 minutes of the movie", "A cinephiles dream. 1969 style.": "It's got Quentin Tarantino all over it. The scenes of black comedy violence, the references to Spaghetti Western cinema genre and some of its greats such as Sergio 'the second best director of the genre' Corbucci!Brad Pitt reprises his wise cracking character from Inglourious Basterds (2009). Here he plays stuntman Cliff Booth to TV, minor Hollywood/Italian spaghetti western actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio).It's set in 1969 and is a cinephiles dream what with the films referenced on cinemas, posters and actual characters such as Steve McQueen, Bruce Lee and Margaret Tate and her husband Roman Polanski.Look out for a great comic scene involving Lee and Booth (Pitt).Alongside the Hollywood storyline is a group of hippies (The Manson clan) which can only mean one thing. Death.I'm not sure how Polanski will have found this part of the screenplay and I won't dwell on it.The on screen chemistry between Pitt and Di Caprio reminded me of Robert Redford and Paul Newman.Everyone looks as if they are having a blast making the film.

Just boring unrelated scenes. Extremely long and. Just bad.", "On how to waste three hours of my life..": "Watch a completley useless, senseless flick about uninteresting characters with no story worth speaking of. Ending in a stupid alternate timeline, who no one cares for. Thank you Tarantino.. award to most useless movie goes to you for sure.", "Loved this Movie": "I was a student at UCLA during the time depicted in the movie. The set design and costumes brought back great memories. My second favorite Tarantino movie after Pulp Fiction.", "Too tarantinian to be a Tarantino": "This movie is often received as something different from other Tarantino's movie, so there are lots of people that don't appreciate it. In my opinion, instead, even if it isn't too much \u00e0 l\u00e0 Tarantino because of there aren't too action and dynamic scenes, it is the regular result of the citation theme of Tarantino's movies.All the film is based on this opposition: Bill and Rick. The first one is a double, the second is the real actor, in a moment of decline. They live near Sharon Tate and the place in which Charles Manson killed her. Now, the opposition generates this situation: the real actor can't live well in the real world (he is in decline, he doesn't manage to reach the great Hollywood as he wants), the double, that's the fake actor in movies, but does the real dangerous scenes (instead Rick avoid them), is able to live in the world (does material tasks, killed his wife, fights and wins against Bruce Lee, that, moreover, is an actor revealed in his weakness outside the set).This mechanism guides the story to a series of situations in which Bill, even if he his who works behind the real actor, manages to do what he wants to do. Until the murder scene: hippies enter in his home and have a fight with him, losing. Also this scene is based on opposition between reality and fiction: the killers, in fact, say that they want to kill the people that teached them to kill, so the actors; at the same time Bill, that had a Lsd dose, thinks that's cruel reality that is happening is just a drug effect (amazing that scene in which he and the killer are one in front of the other, the killer with a real gun, he with a gun made with fingers); moreover all the fight is had between murderers and the double, even if they reached Rick, that instead is in the garden and his action is to kill the hippy with a weapon from a cinematographic set.So, all these things and others (it is the double that goes to the hospital; Tate's murder is leaves outside the movie's space etc.) suggest how strong is this opposition between reality and fiction, that's the typical condition of tarantinian art: the citational system, that's not just a game, but is analyzed in its minimal composition, thought as an estethic question and at the same represented as a concrete mechanism of violence and degradation (of '60s Hollywood, that's showed with a great historical fidelity).", "How to abuse fame and get away with it. Slow, empty, self-indulgent and pseudo-poetic mediocrity.": "Although I knew in advance that this film would be unlike any of Tarantino's previous films, I went into it with appropriate expectations. What I found was a overlong, tedious, boring, unfunny, self-indulgent and empty film with no likeable characters.Many pseudo-poets and philosophers believe they can recognise a deep and qualitative meaning in it, but they would not pay any attention to the film if it did not abuse the 3 big names.Any documentary about the film industry of the 60s and 70s is more interesting than this mediocrity.Even not everything DaVinci made was declared art and masterpiece, same goes for Tarantino.", "Exceptional!": "If you understand movies, this is the one for you. Exceptional directing, acting, cutting and score, a real wow! Tarantino humanizes hollywood, and creates a real masterpiece. Reminds another great movie: Boogie Nights (1997).

Don't miss it.", "A movie you must see twice!": "For almost a year I've waited for this movie to come out. Once I heard that Tarantino was directed a movie that had Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Margo Robbie at the focal point, I knew it was going to be one to remember. I went to the opening night of this movie and was blown away by the phenomenal acting and story telling. Both DiCaprio and Pitt killed it and had me laughing the entire way through as I absolutely fell in love with their characters. Every single scene was packed full of little subtle references that it was impossible to catch them all on a first viewing. It was to the point that I didn't even want to get up to use the restroom because I was afraid that I would miss something. That is why I highly recommend you see this movie twice in order to fully capture everything you might have missed the first time you watched it.\nOne reason why I think some people are having trouble getting into this movie is because they go into it thinking it's going to be like every other Tarantino movie, chalked full of violence and gore (especially since the Manson Murders play a part in the story) but that is really not the case. It's a slower movie that relies more on the character development and dialogue rather than the action to capture its viewers. If you haven't already seen this movie, I highly recommend you go watch it. Even if you aren't a huge movie buff and have no idea who any of the people alluded to in the movie are, you still will have a great time as you fall in love with the story and its characters.", "This movie has no plot (for real), is slow and boring": "There is no plot in this entire movie.

The last 40 minutes is simply classic Tarantino.All I have to say is get ready for a wild ride.", "Sweet Intentions": "Tarantino has created a film that suites the title. He has created a universe and film that brings you back in time. The soundtrack and nostalgia will get you pumped! Definitely a film that will be divisive and as much as it's a Tarantino film it has attributes that make it a very different Tarantino film.

A film that somehow feels both pointless and directionless most of the time yet is completely fascinating and hugely enjoyable. 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is certainly a strange movie, but it's also a great one.The film is deliberately plot-light with the focus instead being on the characters and dialogue and the portrayal of 1960s Hollywood. The simple plot doesn't seem to matter though because, as a piece of entertainment, this film is difficult to fault. It's beautiful to look at and immersive from start to finish, with some outstanding acting performances from DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie.As with any Tarantino film, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' will not be for everyone. The running length, pacing and story may be problematic for some, but personally I got a lot of enjoyment out of it.", "A Hollywood masterpiece": "A nostalgic film with beautiful cinematography, another twisted classic from tarintino", "Maybe Tarantino's Best Yet": "This may well rank as the most brilliant of Tarantino film to date. Where to begin? First there is the attention to period detail of both societal styles of the 1960's, but the popular music and more importantly the TV shows and B-movies of the decade. This movie even far more than the brilliant Coen brothers Buster Scruggs movie lavishes real love particularly on the Hollywood Western genre. But deeper than just the visual acuity and styling, the movie delves more deeply into the lives, minds and character of those who played in those Westerns and were so caught up by the Hollywood system and lifestyle. And Tarantino, always brilliant but long in dialogue, here comes up with great dialogue on a more condensed and sharper scale, but using extreme and intense facial close-ups to reveal more of a character. Finally, anyone who has read an account of the Charlie Manson cult murders will be able to readily identify with certain aspects and characters, but unless you've read or seen spoilers, you will not know where the deliberately heightened tension toward the climax of the film will lead. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino, for this brilliant piece of film artistry.", "The best": "About this movie in my POV is that it ends at one point.

That is ok if the film has a good storyline and plot. In this case there hardly is a storyline. Or at least a very weak one. I felt like the first 80% of the movie was like watching scenes of \"Tarentino freaking out on his love for the 60's and Western films\" (which I hardly know anything about so I'm sure I missed out on tons of references) and then the last maybe 20% was some good old over the top Tarantino stuff, but then that also kinda fell flat because the first 80% of the film was...well just 'so so'.\nAlso since I've seen Mindhunter, I saw how well Damon Herriman played a freaked out and scary Charles Manson in that series. I just can't believe Tarentino, who chose to let Herriman play Manson as well, just let him play a minor cameo role in his movie!

Bravo!", "Love Letter, Not for all.": "The film is almost perfect a personal 9.8, there is a 5 minute sequen e", "Like a summer breeze that surprises and delights": "I didn't see this coming. This whole movie came around my mind like a summer breeze. An unusual story full of twists and unexpected turns. At times I thought it was going to describe factual events and at other times, I was amazed as a complicated fantasy unfolded before my eyes. In many ways I am glad it went the way it went. There is an expectation with Tarantino movies ... as great as they are and they can be, they can also be predictable in many ways ... many good ways. But this movie is different. Perhaps it is an evolution of maturing of the film maker's thinking. Perhaps it is inspired genius to do the unexpected. It is risky to do this, as so many have expectations that they would require to be filled by QT. By the number of critical reviews here on IMDB for this movie, I suspect there are many who cannot handle change and have misinterpreted it for something else. For me though, the ending was the icing on the cake. In the original factual story, the result was so tragic and repugnant that this effort almost provides a ritual healing. It is not something I asked for but I am glad it happened. p.s. it helped that I didn't know what this movie was about and I didn't read any reviews before I watched it.", "Abstract weirdness": "The cast of this deserves every imaginable award possible for keeping me from turning this crap off! I would compare this script /movie to an abstract painting - Full of color and different Visual languages, but by the end of the movie I was pained with regreat wondering why this thing made no sense. Not a fan, and the only reason I would refer this movie would be to prank someone, because that is how I felt after reading such great reviews. Acting was top notch, visually was outstanding, but the script was garbage.", "Best movie this year": "All this thrashing of all these shows lately this year the greatest shows that have come out for the Irishman Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and quite a few others but I honestly believe that this is one of those best acting and went to Brad Pitt's best roles and Tarantino's one of his amazing scripts is sorrow sad letter of how Hollywood is dying and just becoming a God damn playground Lakes course he said. 10 outta 10 all the way", "Once apovn a time": "Brilliant.

Although both DiCaprio and Pitt were great and did everything they could, they had better performances in other movies but the chemistry between them gave me life, Margot's performance was one of her best and let me just say: AL PACINO AL PACINO AL PACINO! just like every other Tarantino movie the soundtrack was beyond amazing, however I didn't really feel as attached to the characters as I did in his other movies, but if we're not gonna compare it to his older movies it was super satisfying and met my super high expectations. Highly recommended", "The End - I'm never visiting a movie theatre again..": "Spoiler? This 'movie' is difficult to spoil unless in your review you say that 'nothing happens or has meaningful consequence'.This movie makes me despair for humanity. The fact there are so many 10's demonstrates how the audience don't even know when they've been insulted.DeCaprio yet again plays an unlikeable self entitled rich brat.. only this time he is a half baked self entitled rich brat 'movie star' who loses it\n.. because..?...\n.. he's an unlikeable self entitled rich brat movie star ..\n.. and we love this why?Are our lives so empty of meaning that we now love the icons of meaninglessness?We actually identify with the pursuit of shameless greed, rage and hate this much.Is such material superficiality the goal now?.. we just adore the depictions of self obsession - frothing from the mouth into a murderous frenzy, where flame throwers are used as an extension of material and sexual frustration?The audience applauds it's own mental demise and I feel slightly ill and weak because of it.QT is calling his non-Hollywood elite fans 'filthy (raging sequence of expletives) hippies' by reversing the outcome of the Manson murders?Because he wants to symbolically kill his fans?\nThat's his subliminal 'send off' message from this final movie?The graphic depictions of ultra violence we have paid money directly into his pocket to see is something he now wishes upon us; for being so stupid for liking it in the first place?Think back to the conversation in the car before the attempted murders commence. If you can get past the truly terribly acting and dialogue..\n.. they want to inflict the violence Hollywood taught them..\nas if they would have that particular conversation just before going in with such crazy intentions.. Talk about mailing it in. Awful.None of the scenes made sense.\nCliff kicks Bruce Lee's ass? Right .. okay and.. now.. so what..?It was as though each scene were all boring stand alone thoughts QT had half recalled from other movies,, and he tried to throw them in together and just hope for the best. Or did he even care this time?What was all those scenes from real movies.. oh just forget it.. so dull and pointless.Style over substance. And the style? It's the 60's! Woo hoo! We get it!\nThat's not even 'style' when its the only thing the movie has to 'offer'.. it's like a plate of gravy with no food.Hey Quentin why didn't you have at least three more hours of just brad Pitt doing absolutely 'nothing'.\nSay ... driving? .. or feeding his dog? I mean.. those scenes just weren't long and drawn out and borrrring enough.Dialogue?\nRambling, motionless, meaningless. I think it's left me with toothache (?!) as refered pain from the headache it was givng me.Every scene I couldn't wait to end.QT put a kid in a long scene .. and the result.. as always.. a total failure of delivery. He'd know this.. so why attempt it?I've enjoyed almost every scene QT has shot prior this is, apart from the Kill Bill moves and half of the last three movies he made.. okay so now I realize he's been slipping for some time now.. but this is the literal cliff.Thank god it's his last movie, he ran out of gravy a long time ago.. the damage is so bad.. makes me wonder if there was anything but warm granules of cheap reprocessed powder.", "Dont really know what to think": "I mean, what was the purpose of this movie. Is it to make you feel better about the actual murders that happened? So yea its weird. im sure it would all have a meaning. The jump cuts, the narriation, the skits ect. I just dint get it.\nIts a very believable movie. Well shot, good props ect. But the movie felt hollow.6/10: nice and all, but kinda skattered", "Tarantino's version of Hollywood?": "Allowing some time to let the story settle in I decided to review this. Warning: may contain spoliers.The movie is fictional based on real characters and probably on some true stories that each character may have expeienced throughout their life. Some stories have been based on certain biographies.The characters appearing in this movie is a typical wide cast small parts with the exception of the main characters. Overall an excellent cast as always with some very interesting short roles they take on.Rick Dalton (Leonardo dicaprio) and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) are working together as actor and stunt double going through their own way of life helping each other in whatever scenario they have been set on, mostly resembling a close brotherly relationship over the course of a day.Attempting to address Cliff Booths issue about his wife is mildy touched upon by Randy played by Kurt Russell. Fair to say QT has continued his way and not let the media guide his thought process from activities (not necessarily his) from previous years surrounding these areas.The movie takes you on a ride from an everyday life of a popular/struggling actor and trying to overcome his fear of failure and have that break he deserves. You go through a long magnitude of verbal stories and light action at the start of the movie, setting the character base in a true QT style before unleasing the nature of the story and bringing all the characters together. Great story telling skills as well as great acting. There were times I felt I knew what would happen next and I was glad I was wrong with my thinking on that ground, so safe to say the movie does go through some great twist(s).The story doesn't resemble around Sharon Tate which i thought was very well thought and the movie still remains interesting with the violence once again is very through.QT's 9th film is still bumping with some solid fresh material. Looking forward to watching it again when released on Bluray.... Hopefully an uncut version with more content and the making.", "Boring and disappointing": "There is nothing to talk about this movie because nothing happened.", "Tarantino's most personal movie": "If you watch this expecting a typical Tarantino movie, you will probably end up being disappointed. This movie has a lot of Tarantino's trademarks but it also happens to be very different compared to the rest of his filmography.The focus of this movie are the 2 main leads, a \"has-been\" television star and his loyal stunt double and their lives during 1960s Hollywood. This movie is Tarantino's tribute to the time period similar to how Roma was to Alfonso cuaron. These 2 characters are actually plot devices used to represent how things were back then. The relationship between these 2 characters is the heart of the movie and I will definitely watch hours of them just talking to each other about random stuff, because of how well written they are. Their individual subplots are equally entertaining. The ending was pure Tarantino and was the highlight of the movieWhen it comes to the negative aspects, I personally didn't like the way Sharon Tate was included in the movie. I completely understand why she's in this movie but it would've been better if she was a little more involved with the storyline of the 2 main leadsOverall this movie was amazing and it's my third favorite Tarantino movie after django unchained and inglorious basterds", "A Daring Surprise Climax": "I've just watched the film, and I felt I should do something I rarely do and write a review, because I wish to express my appreciation of Tarantino's ingenuity and originality. The film is long and moves at a leisurely but engrossing pace, and it never lost my interest. It does something unusual - it gets better and better as it goes along, and the last half-hour is sensational. It dares to rewrite history and avenges the victims of the Manson murders. And it ends with a non-PC period advert that would never make it into a cinema today on its own terms. Only a truly creative director could do such things. I do have some reservations. I thought that Bruce Lee was unfairly treated (although I'm not a fan) and I felt that most of the historical characters - with the exception of Sharon Tate - didn't look enough like the originals. However, it has too many virtues to list, and it often made me laugh out loud. I was glad to see it, and I look forward to watching it again on DVD.", "Tarantino ready for retirement": "A shockfully boring and dissapointing movie. Only things that stand out are the acting of Di Caprio, the touch of the 60s era and the last 10 minutes of the movie. Other than that, if this movie did not have Tarantino label, would be vut before reaching production. Wait for it... It will never come! Only for 60s, cowboys, Brad Pitt and DiCaprio lovers...", "Was forced to watch this by my wife": "I was forced to watch this by my wife, even though it was originally my choice of film at the cinema. Due to this, I went in to the film with low expectations. However the film was a great surprise. Very funny and very good timing because we'd just been watching mind Hunter. Very good choice by tarantino not to follow the true story too closely and turn the ending into a blood bath. Much better to add some humour in as he did at the ending", "Boring ASF": "The most boring movie I have ever seen. Acting was good but the directing was absolutely terrible", "A genuinely delightful glimpse of Hollywood during the 60s, with some great characters": "As is the case with any upcoming Tarantino feature, expectations for \"Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood\" were high. Tarantino himself had widely praised the Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt duo as one of the most memorable ever put on film. The vague nature of the synopsis, which suggested a link between the Manson Family murders and the story of a has been actor, fed the imagination of fans who could already picture a series of coincidences typical of Tarantino's films, blending both historical events and fiction in the same fashion as in previous opuses (\"Inglorious Basterds\" and \"Django Unchained\", to name the most obvious examples).\"Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood\" tells the story of a Hollywood actor (who is actually a bit of a whiner) on the downhill slope, Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double, a failed actor turned stuntman, Cliff Booth (played by a Brad Pitt at the top of his game). The story is interspersed with a few scenes featuring Sharon Tate (played by the sublime Margot Robbie) who, at the time, was a star on the rise.The film depicts the lightness of being that stemmed from 1960s Hollywood, taking us behind the scenes of the El Dorado of large-scale film production and amply showing the light-hearted attitude of a generation that smoked cigarettes relentlessly, drove luxury cars at full speed on the narrowest roads, hitchhiked with absolute strangers and spent nights dancing to the rhythms of bands that are now absolutely legendary. The many touches of humour and cultural references are very much enjoyable, so was the dialogue, which is delightfully on point. The greatest moments were definitely those few explosions of violence, which were as funny as they were over-the-top. The pace is slow and the characters are voluble. Tarantino took some rather bold liberties in writing: depicting Bruce Lee as a bit cocky and self-loving; implying certain things about Tate and her ex-boyfriend and, of course, the denouement of the story.If there is one issue with the script, I would say it is a lack of dramatic impetus, as very few significant events punctuate the story, the outcome of which will seem to come from nowhere for anyone unaware of the circumstances surrounding Sharon Tate's murder. Although this cinematic experience is very pleasant, in retrospect, there is not much going on throughout, to be honest.As a character-driven film, the dialogue largely compensates, but it would have been interesting to learn about these characters through a wider variety of situations/turning points. Also, the famous Booth/Dalton duo could have shared the screen for a greater proportion of the total duration of the film, in my view, as I agree with Tarantino that it was much fun to watch, with both actors bringing a nice chemistry to life with those two characters.With a terrific cast, including Al Pacino, Emile Hirsch, Luke Perry, Kurt Russel and Bruce Dern and Timothy Olyphant, Tarantino offers us a film entirely driven by its characters, without whom the story would be of rather modest interest. It should also be noted that Margaret Qualley and Julia Butters both offer memorable performances that rank among the film's highlights. The direction and cinematography are stellar, and as in any Tarantino film, get ready for an awesome soundtrack as well.All in all, in my opinion, although \"Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood\" does not qualify as one of Tarantino's very best films, it is nevertheless a delightfully fun film of very high quality, from which a contagious pleasure emanates.", "Booooooooring": "This is by far the most boring movie I have ever seen. I just seen a 2.5 hour movie about nothing. There was no plot. How is this film nominated for best picture is beyond me. I can't express enough how boring this movie is.", "Return to Form": "Great to see Tarantino return to the peak of his powers after a few sub-par efforts. Pitt and di Caprio give powerhouse performances, sharp script that doesn't miss a beat and grungy production design that nails the era.", "Not that great.": "Only liked Brad Pitt scenes.\nLeonardo was acting but not an entertaining/influenced one.\nDidn't get why Sharon tate character was included ??????", "Dread.": "Took me a while to figure out what it was about this film I liked. I'm a major fan of QT as are most people who watched this film. Like most, I came out of it with an uneasy feeling of what to think of it. And after like a year I figured it out. It's dread.Dread, the feeling of impending doom. The whole movie, although it has colorful cinematography and a magnificent soundtrack, the whole movie feels uneasy. As if something bad is about to happen, and it never stops. The feeling that the first wave of battle isn't the last, the feeling that the hurricanes storm isn't the end of it.The movie is about the end of Hollywood's golden age. The fall of Rick Daltons Career, the widening gap of Cliff and Ricks relationship and the eery feeling that what's going to happen to Sharon will happen. The movie captures the dread of the time perfectly. From cliff seeing Charles Manson outside Sharon Tate's house, to Cliff going to the infamous Manson Ranch. The feeling is always there, the emotion of fear is always looming in Hollywood LA 1969. It's shown throughout our character, throughout the story and thought the downfall of Hollywood's golden age.", "Well... that was disappointing": "Great cast, good acting, but SO BORING. An absolute pointless storyline that goes nowhere.", "A fantastic experience of a film": "What an incredible film.This film is an experience, not just something you go and see in the cinema. Much like other films like American Graffiti and Dazed and Confused, it feels like you are right there with the characters. It feels like this floating, beautiful piece of poetry almost, with how everything is perfectly put together and crafted to create a perfectly paced film.With its interesting and inner conflicted characters that feel so rich in depth and raw emotion, it offers something that will keep you interested throughout the whole experience. With this, comes one of the best casts put together on film.I feel as if Tarantino is doing what Kubrick did, he is reinventing the way you look at films. Not only this, but he is also making something entirely different each time he writes and directs, offering a large array of interesting range and stylistic quality to his films that nothing else can or ever will match.This is now one of my favourite Tarantino films, and I will watch it again and again.", "BEST MOVIE EVER!!!": "Besides the first 2 hours and 15 minutes, the movie was great! Not a single bit of plot though, but if you have absolutely nothing to do In your life I suggest watching it", "Aimless": "I love Tarantino movies and like Leo and Brad. Looks good. Can't wait.A quarter of the way in....sometimes you have to give these movies a chance to develop....Half way in.....wife has fallen asleep.....ok, this has got to be going somewhere, right?Three quarters finished.....this might not be going anywhere.Ending....what just happened? That was stupid and it made no sense.I see people reviewing this movie tying themselves up in knots trying to explain how this was some sort of esoteric masterpiece but seriously, it was just boring.Aimless. Pointless. Bewildering.Just because Tarantino is a directorial genius doesn't mean that everything he does is brilliant. Such is the case with this movie.", "Cinema brilliance": "Some of the reviews I've seen on here are embarrassing. Maybe you have to be a kid born in the 60's to understand all of Tarantino's brilliant references. Giving it a 1 or 2 seems like childish pouting. Amazing performances by both Leo and Pitt and as in most Tarantino movies there are BRILLIANT scenes. Rick Dalton's scenes with the little girl actor are brilliant. Many other brilliant scenes including Bruce Lee, Cliff and Rick drinking and watching his \"FBI\" series appearance, Manson's ranch and of course the entire crazy and surprising ending to the Manson conflict. Great ode to late 60's tv...I too love that era like QT obviously does.", "Boring!!!": "Tarantino made a terrible film, but at least manage to find the cure for insomnia. Good thing that this was his last film (hopefully). Waste of my time and waste of good actors.", "Not great": "This is not Tarantino's best work.Extended omage to old time Hollywood. Very little happens. One entire story felt irrelevant; they didnt even tie it to the main story.Pleasant enough to watch but this felt more like a slow paced art house film than a Hollywood banger.Very long. The trademark Tarantino abrupt violence at the end felt forced, out of place, and not worth the wait.Maybe worth a watch if youre really bored and need to burn three hours...", "HORRIBLE!!!!!": "The only good thing is the performances of some actors. Give me back my money please, 3 hours of life I already lost ....", "Self indulgent 'boys toys' rudderless script 1 hour too long": "This gets a star for Brad and a star for Leo. One more star to share for the Photography and Art Department. No stars at all for spoilt Quentin.\nThis film is what happens when a movie geek gets all the toys in the shop to play with and no one to tell him it's bedtime. He wrote the script. Someone should have edited it several times over. He directed the movie and again someone should have edited at least an hour off it and added some semblance of pace and progression.The hype has only been matched by my disappointment. It's not enough to fill the screen with love letters to the past. It's not enough to more than faithfully recreate a Golden Era Hollywood. Yes it must be a terrible shame for Quentin that he was born twenty odd years too late. But he should be\nthankful, because in the golden age he wouldn't have got past 'b' movie directing. Brad and Leo make a good fist of a flabby script and plot. Yes they would have had the chops to make it in any Hollywood age. But filling the screen with the Paul Newman and Robert Redford of our day isn't enough to entertain an audience for 2.5 hours. I've never see an almost empty cinema give such a wholehearted yawn. Some people were verbally angry and annoyed at the waste of time and money. Many many people will laud this with accolades. I know not why. I'm going home to watch some real masterpieces from that era and remind myself what great directing and great scripts can really achieve. This imitation is a poor one indeed.", "Quentin Tarantino is \"fantastic\" writer and director": "He managed to make the worst movie I have ever watched, although there was a fantastic crew of actors.

If IMDB continues like this, the same future awaits them.\nThere are many more viewers than directors, writers and producers.", "Why so much hate?": "Well, I have watched a 500+ movies (most were from 20th century),and some were crap, some were astonishing. I don't remember that I degraded any movie like many reviewers here degrade this one.\nWhen I heard It's gonna hit theathers I bought a tickets 2 weeks in advance. Movie started and I really enjoyed almost every minute of it. I liked the soundtrack full of 1968 songs which some of I used to listen a lot and their great timing such as ,,Hush'' with Sharon Tate's hair waving in the rhythm of a song and amazing free ride with Brad Pitt through 1969s Hollywood which landscape seemed really cool and lively.\nI also liked Old Hollywood references (spaghetti westerns, Polanski, McQueen etc.)\nNext, I don't remember seeing very often movies where an actor plays the actor who plays someone else and still somehow you can identify all three( scene where Rick Dalton holds a girl on a knee) in a wonderful performance by DiCaprio.\nI also liked rehearsal scenes first with a magnetophone and later in actual studio.\nEvery scene with Brad Pitt as Cliff Boot (the most Tarantino character) was entertaining : Bruce Lee scene, Spare Tire scene and of course the last scene.\nI was waiting for a Sharon Tate murder for a whole movie, and when I realised that instead I got a crazy Manson family vs Cliff Booth fight I laughed and whole movie in the moment came completed as a perfect fusion of sightseeing old Hollywood and crazy Tarantino action.\nMovie made my day and I thought that everybody will found it charming. I was wrong. Many of my friends called it crap and bad. I thought , OK, they never heard what actually happened to Sharon Tate and they do not get references or understand Tarantino's way of expressing tribute to particular events or genres.\nBut when I saw pile of negative reviews on IMDb I was seriously questioning my taste. What's so wrong and bad about this movie?\nActing? It was great.\nStory? Interesting depiction of an everyday life of an old Hollywood fading actor, his stuntman and New Hollywood actress, they connections and huge differences.\nDuration? I don't know, maybe I got a stamina from watching movies like Gone With A Wind, Ten Commandments, 1900, Lawrence of Arabia etc. so this movie didn't seem so long to me.\nPlot? O Yeah : no plot , no plot blah blah blah . Well many great movies have no plot such as La Dolce Vita or even Pulp Fiction. Sometimes directors try to improvise, sometimes they want to study characters ,and sometimes they want to make you feel like stucked in a day with a characters which I believed It's a case with this one.\nI watched all 9 Tarantino films(I'm not even a huge fan of him) and I admit, this is not his best,but it's far,far away from being his worst. Well, It depends of a taste but in the worst case it's definitely better than Jackie Brown and Death Proof(I liked these movies as well)\nSo anyone giving this movie a rating 1,2 or 3 should not be taken seriously and I found it hard to believe they actually understood movie at all.\nIf Joker with x time recycled plot and psycho/white heat mother complex themes have a rating 8.7 this movie should have at least 8. I don't get it.", "Boring and overrated": "This film feels like a filler episode in a bad TV programme.

Rick, with Cliff's help, wants to make it big in Hollywood, during the final phase of Hollywood's golden era in 1969 Los Angeles.Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is a fantastic film. Director Quentin Tarantino has given us a one of a kind love letter to 1960s Hollywood, that'll definitely make you yearn for the bygone era. This is a slow burn movie, anchored by phenomenal performances by its leads. The climax is totally unexpected & will blow your mind. Don't watch this film, expecting classic Tarantino fare, throughout. Leonardo DiCaprio is spectacular as Rick Dalton. Brad Pitt is outstanding as Cliff Booth. It's awe-inspiring to see DiCaprio & Pitt unite on the big screen, for the first time. Leonardo DiCaprio & Brad Pitt share effortless camaraderie & bonhomie, in all their scenes together. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Sharon Tate. Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Julia Butters, Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Mike Moh & Al Pacino are excellent as Jay Sebring, Pussycat, James Stacy, Trudi, Tex, Squeaky Fromme, George Spahn, Bruce Lee & Marvin Schwarz, respectively.

I tried to watch Pulp Fiction as example and never have I been able to get thru the entire movie. Adding to that as my wife and I saw this movie just hours ago at this writing, I leaned over after the first 60 minutes or so and said \"honey we can leave any time if you want\" \"no\"was her response, \"we have to see how it ends\". Reluctantly I slouched back in my seat and proceeded to finish my popcorn. Two hours later this movie is a 10! Without giving too much away, I have read and seen \"Helter Skelter\" having been at the time of the murders in the sixties A middle teenager, I am very familiar with that story and it is both terrible and yet fascinating at the same time mostly due to the details. What Tarantino did with that story is what anyone would have loved to see happen as an alternate ending to that tragedy. A must see movie in my opinion and I will see it again for I am certain there are many hidden details that I missed. Great Film!", "Writing my first ever review to tell you this was an absolute snoozefest": "Nothing more to it. Completely overrated. Coming from a big movie nerd who loves slow movies.

By the way, loved that Al Pacino named the girl Gina at the beginning", "Terrible movie.": "I went to see this with my daughter who knew nothing about these times. Brad Pitt was the only one worth watching. We had no idea it was about the Manson group a nauseating thing. It was good watching Brad Pitt kill these people but that's not what happened unfortunately. And it didn't happen next door to Sharon Tate's. It was a nightmare that happened at her house with more people who were all killed. Bad taste.", "boring long waiting for anything": "You wait 2.5h for something to happen..and it doesn't.

Of course mostly because I'm a great fan of several Tarantino movies.\nBut this movie was a great disappointment at least the first 130 minutes of the 150 minutes or so - where literally nothing happened. Sure it was nice to go down memory lane and see the sunny Hollywood in the year of 1969, and yes I did enjoy Margot Robbie in pure 4K res - then again who wouldn't ;-)This is by far not a normal Tarantino movie. There's close to no action or coherent nor interesting story. I was hoping Tarantino could force Brad Pitt into unusual roles (like Travolta in Pulp Fiction), but Brad Pitt and DiCaprio were just like you've seen them in most of their other movies. None of them expressed many emotions, neither anger or happiness - ok, DiCaprio maybe a little - but emotionally everything - apart from maybe 10 minutes - was just ... dull. I've got no clue why Pitt won an Oscar for this semi-mediocre performance. I get it why Phoenix won for the Joker - because Phoenix totally owned that Oscar - but Pitt!?!?\nIf you miss reliving the summer of 1969 in Hollywood, see this collection of scenes - if you want an interesting story or action look elsewhere. I'd rated the movie 4/10, thank you Margot I'd rate the movie 2/10 without you :-) Music and sound were great though.Btw - regarding any bias - I'd rate both Pulp Fiction and Hateful Eight 10/10.", "Tarantino's Passion Project": "Not your typical Tarantino.

It's almost like a movie that tells you a usual activities behind the scene of every movie that came out from hollywood in the 60's without a build up to something interesting in the end (like Tarantino usually did in his previous movies). I kind of a bit disappointed, I enjoyed it at first, some of the scenes are funny, then some of the flashbacks on some of the characters, their struggle to survive in the world of acting, some shots that I personally think similar to that of contemporary movies (which makes me think that Tarantino gets a little bit off), smart dialogs and phrases, and some powerful casts.Props to Brad Pitt who always successfully makes his characters really cool and tough (reminds you of Lt. Aldo Raine from 'Inglorious Basterds') and Di Caprio's ability to bring up to life a crybaby, hot-headed, narcissistic ambitious movie star. My god, you need to see how he played his character that makes mistakes by not recalling some of his line in a relatively long take, his frustration from that, then his comeback when one of the star says it was the best acting ever. in the end, Tarantino never forgets to put a happy ending in the end. But without so much of a conflict from a not-so-big of a build up, does it worth it even though personally I like it?", "Seriously guys?": "So in a short, if you throw big names in really bad movie it still gonna get high rating, do you know why? Coz every high rater wanna think he is sophisticated and gets it.", "Oscar for worst movie of 2019": "This is by far the biggest waste of money I've ever seen gone into a movie. I'm stunned on how highly rated this movie is. It just blows my mind that people are rating this crap 10s and 9s..", "Everything made sense or not at the same time. Can't explain it further.": "This is a very difficult movie to review. We are speaking about an elite group of actors and a top writer. However, this movie is not a masterpiece. Is just a crazy movie with a crazy / unconnected plot and joyful, exemplary acting. Margot Robbie's role in the movie is unjastifiable. Certainly, a tone of wasted screen time on her and nothing to shine her potential. I am between 7 and 8 but 7 it is.", "Once upon a time I fell asleep zzzz": "Extremely boring. The movie dragged. I felt no empathy for the characters since there were random scenes thrown together. The characters have no connection and there isn't a real plot you can follow. It was a mess and a waste of 3 hours of my life.", "Feet feet feeet!": "YES. I'm a Tarantino fan. Love most of his movies and really like the rest. Even that tiny story in Four rooms. This movie, I only like.Anyone who knows a bit about Tarantino knows he has a foot fetish. Feet are an important part of his films but this time it looks like he took an excerpt from Dr. Seuss's \" The Foot Book\". I'm sure that's in his book collection NOT collecting dust.Besides the feet, this movie is on a slow slow cooker. Tarantino loves giving his characters plenty of dialogue so you can fully get to know them. To many people this will be a complete bore. I like his style of letting the viewer know the characters in a movie but a couple of times I went ok... let's move on. The movie takes place obviously in Hollywood, in the year 1969. I love 60s culture and music so I enjoyed watching it. I immersed myself in the movie and felt like I was actually watching a recording of people in 1969. I think he did a great job of capturing that time period.There are some funny moments in the movie but the ending is absolutely the best. I loved it. This is another one of those I-wished-this-happened-instead movies. I will be definitely watching this movie again but when I am able to fast forward certain parts. It's a good movie. I'm glad I watched it all the way through but I won't watch all of it again. It was a tad bit too long for my taste. It doesn't take away how great the actors were or how it was filmed and how he captures that year. Still liked the movie overall but loved the ending.", "Fun": "I was eagerly waiting for this movie. I predicted the ending of the movie before watching the movie. Acting was great. Tarantino-style Tarantino movie. I liked it, but it was not good compared to other movies. It was fun to watch in the cinema.", "On Quentin Tarantino's \"Revenge Fantasy\" extravaganza": "\"Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood\" is Quentin Tarantino's 9th feature film (his penultimate, if he really decides to retire after his 10th film, as he's said before). From countless references to a myriad of films (pastiche or homage, depending on how you look at it) to excessive shots of female feet and an ultraviolent climax, it seems like just your typical Tarantino film. It is. But that's not necessarily a good thing.The only Tarantino film I truly love is Pulp Fiction, though I find things to admire in all of them. I've always admired him more as a fellow film buff than as a filmmaker. He's undeniably talented, but extremely self-indulgent. Still, he's one of the few living filmmakers (Paul Thomas Anderson - a much superior filmmaker - is another one) that give us a true film event with every new work they release. They both make one film every few years, but while Anderson manages to always surprise us with the complexity and maturity of his work, Tarantino has been stuck with the simplistic \"revenge fantasy\" genre that he redefined with Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012).I can't really express my disappointment with Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood without giving away spoilers. I won't bother with plot details and a synopsis, since I'm assuming you've seen the film if you're reading this. Just like Basterds ended with Nazis getting killed and Django gave slaves a chance to get revenge on their \"masters,\" OUATIH ends with the Manson followers that murdered Sharon Tate and her friends in 1969... getting killed by Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. In Tarantino's overlong, meandering and superficial \"love letter\" to Los Angeles and movies, Sharon Tate gets to live.At the same time that I think we did NOT need another sensationalist movie depicting the Manson murders in graphic detail - and we all wish Tate had had a happy ending - I also find the \"revenge fantasy\" genre, when focusing on such tragic events (Holocaust, slavery, and the senseless murdering of innocents), to be simplistic and somewhat disrespectful. It is indeed easy to give the audience bloody satisfaction in seeing members of the Manson clan dying in a most grotesque way. It's also borderline idiotic. Tarantino can do whatever he wants with his films; as one should. But the 56 year-old filmmaker that he is now isn't any more mature than the 28 year-old that made Reservoir Dogs. His work is entertaining, and for some it's even cathartic; but it's too shallow for its own good. There's more to the art of filmmaking than rewriting history in straight lines, just like I believe there are superior films that Tarantino could give us if he tried a bit harder.", "With his latest film, Tarantino pays homage to the changing film industry": "Once Upon a Time .. in Hollywood a new drama comedy is directed, written and partly produced by Quentin Tarantino, the director of Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained.The film is set in 1969 in Los Angeles where the film and television world are changing considerably. TV star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) try to keep working in the changing film industry, but due to all the changes, this world is no longer the way it used to be. For example, they begin to wonder whether they might be getting too old to work in the film industry.With this film, it seems that Quentin Tarantino made the film as a tribute to the former film industry and how it is changing, and is still changing now. For example, he shows images with events that were possible in the past, but nowadays are soon found to be politically incorrect.\nWith this film, Tarantino also shows how film making has changed over time. For example, he actually made a film in which a film is made. In this way you get to see scenes where the characters in a film act, but then, for example, are stopped by the director or a mistake made by you and then the scenes have to be repeated.\nTarantino is also familiar with using moments or characters that actually exist or have existed and to use these in a fictional way in his own films. He often does this in order to convey dark moments in a respectful way, lighter and with more comedy. In this film, for example, Tarantino uses the characters Bruce Lee, an action actor who really existed in Hollywood, who is played in this film by Mike Moh. Bruce Lee's daughter Shannon Lee thinks they have made her father appear in the film too arrogantly.\nThe film also responds somewhat to the truly happening Manson Murders events where the Manson Family cult committed murders that have made some famous Hollywood people victims. Tarantino uses this in a playful way, which for people who are familiar with the history of the Manson Murders, may seem disrespectful. Actress Sharon Tate has really been a victim of the Manson Family, but Debra Tate has given the sister of Sharon Tate Margot Robbie who plays Sharon Tate in this film jewels that were really worn by Sharon. She has also helped Tarantino with how her sister comes across in this film and has given her further approval.Due to the many events and characters in the film, the pace of the film can sometimes seem a bit slow or the actions and events of some characters as somewhat unnecessary. Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate is really only needed for the construction of certain upcoming scenes, but due to the adjustments Tarantino has made, her character is often used unnecessarily in the film.The film sets and the clothing of the cast do help with the realistic transfer of the times in which the film takes place. Tarantino's changes in film sets and clothing also show how the film industry has changed over time.The acting is also well done by the cast. For Leonardo DiCaprio, this is his return as an actor. Since he won the Oscar for best actor in 2015 with his acting in the film The Revenant, he has not played in films for a while. Despite this temporary stop, he still delivers good acting in this film as an actor trying to keep his head above water in the changing film industry.\nThe best acting is provided by Brad Pitt, who as a stuntman is taken less seriously in the changing film industry. In this way, he creates comic moments where his character walks around behind the scenes on film sets and provides a lot of comic comments about how films are now being made in this changing film industry.\nOther major actors from the cast such as Margot Robbie, Kurt Russell and Al Pacino play more supporting roles. Their characters try to help Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth or criticize the two with the actions they make.", "What a self indulgent waste of 3 hours.": "What the title says. I enjoyed watching Leo and Brad bit apart from their performances this movie was a total waste of time. Quentin Tarantino needs a goddamn editor.", "Kept waiting for it to get good": "Can't believe this is an academy front runner! It has to be because of the homage to days gone by...yet, despite a great cast, it's just dull. Totally overrated and wouldn't have been made with Tarantino's name being attached to the script.", "Just for kicks throw in a plot": "Couldn't wait for the movie to end. Unless you like basically unrelated scenes, barely a thread holding a film together and an over the top ending, you can skip this one. Why not throw in a plot? Pacino's character lays out what could have been a plot but no. I knew it was going to be trouble when we watch Brad Pitt driving home for 5 minutes with nothing happening. Spoiler alert not necessary. There's nothing to spoil!", "Tarantino's most polarizing movie": "This movie was on my radar since it was announced. Having a talented filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino working with extraordinary talents such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie can make any Tarantino fan burst with excitement. However, this film will certainly divide audiences.Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood follows Rick Dalton and his best friend/stunt double Cliff Booth as they traverse through the fading golden era of Hollywood.This is a film that will bring about a mixed reception amongst audiences. Tarantino fans who come to this film expecting an abundance of blood and gore may become disappointed due to the film's moderately slow pacing and lack of action. This is a film dedicated to 1960s Hollywood and is aimed at cinephiles rather than the average moviegoer but I feel many people, cinephile or not, will adore this movie.This film put a huge smile on my face. As someone who loves cinema, it's great to see a film full of nostalgia from a creator that is clearly sharing his passion for films. What I love about Tarantino movies is the level of authenticity each film has in relation to their time period. The production design is fantastic. At no point does this film lose the 60s atmosphere. There are scenes where you see Pitt driving his car through the streets of LA and the sets look absolutely gorgeous. No wonder it won the Oscar for Best Production Design. We are also accompanied with Tarantino's exquisite dialogues. This is definitely one of Tarantino's funniest films. Apart from the humour, the characters are well written, especially Rick Dalton, which helped me be constantly invested throughout.The technical aspects are great but the performances are a huge positive. After a gap of 4 years, DiCaprio is back and he shines in this film. His character goes through a variety of emotions and struggles with his fading stardom which DiCaprio effortlessly conveys. Brad Pitt plays a great contrast to DiCaprio's character and is, without a doubt, the fan favourite of the entire movie. Pitt's chemistry with DiCaprio is wonderful allowing both of them to be a very memorable part of the film. Despite her limited character, Robbie portrays Sharon Tate with utmost sincerity. The rest of the cast ranging from Pacino, Qualley and Fanning give great performances as well.This movie is not going to be for everyone. The lack of an actual story may make people bored. Despite this, I loved the route Tarantino decided to take with a film like this. The slower pacing and character driven narrative made me never lose interest in what I was watching. The third act is especially entertaining as that's when old Tarantino kicks in. He certainly knows how to deliver a satisfying ending.I really liked Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. The movie looks stunning and Tarantino writes a screenplay filled with hilarious dialogues and memorable characters. The acting is exceptional and the 60s atmosphere the film gives off made me feel really happy.", "Great cast": "This movie was a major disappointment. It seems to be bunch of non related snipets. No story or plot, not a good one anyway. It is one of the worst movies I have seen", "An explosive alternative to history": "I can't stop thinking about this picture. The portrayal of ordinary people, wanna-be-stars just living their lives, going about their business in that 1970's 'light,' so bright, yet dull. I felt all of the anger and frustration that Tarantino orchestrated with this alternate story line of the Sharon Tate/LaBianca murders. This movie brought me uncontrollable sobbing thinking about those innocent lives cut short by that sick demented group lead by Charles Manson. The emotion was so strong it made me stand and want to be right there with Pitt and DiCaprio swinging away at those violent crazies. If only there had been real people like that at the right place and that Manson family had gone to the wrong place. How that would have been justice. Thank you Tarantino for expressing the pain that that brutality brought to so many people and for doling out a better consequence...even if it was only in a movie.", "How is this so low": "I thought this film was amazing, going through the history of Hollywood and the ending was just amazing, 10/10 for me", "Modern Fairy-Tale": "The movie is definetely not for everyone.This is realy a love letter to industry at late 60s'.Throughout Rick character we're looking at all the issues which every actor/actress had/has.Let's turn around on the film.Acting is like a top notch,brillance perfomances by DiCaprio and Pitt.Cinematography and directing are also on very high branch(can we expect differently from Tarantino?).Only what can be neglected is not productive dialogues like we have known from others Tarantino's movies.Anyway,this is really type of movies which can not be seen in theatres so often.So go,get the tickets and enjoy in \"not commercially\" masterpiece.", "Another masterpiece": "Best film of the year. The acting, directing all top notch. This film takes you to another Era and you just soak it all in. I wanted this movie to just keep going, and learn even more about these charachters.", "thank you": "TOP movie, thank you I really enjoyed this movie !!", "The big names are there for a reason....": "To hide the steaming pile of boredom and nothingness this movie is...The only good thing about this movie is the laughs i got reading the reviews by wannabes movie experts Tarantinos fanboys.", "A unique watch": "Thoroughly enjoyed it despite the slow development. The climax of the film did not disappoint.", "Will it be classic?": "The songs......the cars........ the locations.....the editing......... classic Tarantino", "Needs the second watch": "I got to say when i first watched the film i was confused, the film itself follows an odd narrative structure (I mean it's Tarantino ,like it ever was gonna follow a normal one) I still enjoyed it, but it felt off when watching it. i had a similar emotional curve watching pulp fiction. didn't enjoy it on the first watch but came to love it and each and ever watch it grows on me more and more. My brief summary would be, It's long, if you don't have an appreciation for 60's retro groove, the Hollywood system and stunning indulged cinematography the film may seem slow. This isn't helped by Tarantino's particular but resonating Dialogue. The last 30 minuets on the other hand, i can't imagine anyone not liking, its Bloody brilliant ;)For a person who doesn't appreciate the above... The question is whether you're willing to sacrifice two hours for a 30 minute climaxNow as to why i believe it requires a second watch, when watching for the first time everything is unexpected or at least could be. Anything could happen. Your brain is scowering for a plot, and in this film there isn't one, you're wondering what act of the film your in, will it end in 10 minuets? 5 minuets? This is true of all films but most of all Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. A second watch lets you relax and appreciate the subtle moments of the film, you know the end point of the film where its all heading towards. You're excited to see certain moments again, they may not be full of action but the acting and dialogue are superb. For me its a whole film chock full of the classic \"Royale with cheese\" which to me is the perfect Tarantino classic and why i gave it a 10/10", "Not your typical Tarantino, but great nonetheless!": "This film is the furthest from the stylistic ultra-violence and witty banter that Tarantino usually provides with great storytelling and direction. It doesn't need to be. He shows us another side of himself and his skill set, in my opinion. This movie is brilliant, beautiful, and funny. With a just SPLASH of what you're used to from one of the greatest writer/directors of all time.", "I wish I could have my 3 hours back": "There is absolutely no story. It follows around a few people's meaningless lives. Then one brutal scene. Then it leaves you wondering why you even bothered watching it.", "OMG! OMG! OMG! How boring!": "Two hours and forty minutes and I am the one who wants to go Kill Bill 3 on the people who made this movie. Fair enough there are a few scenes that are cool but the rest is just a cure for chronic insomnia.", "I can still feel the magic in his movies.": "Well, if you know that you are watching a QT movie than you will find this movie great. I enjoyed every minute.Many people can say, that the movie does not have a point, but trust me, it does.I would say that this is one of my favorite movies.", "Great movie, don't take the negative reviews into consideration": "Absolute masterpiece. For those feeling nostalgia from that epoque, it is definitely breathtaking. No need to mention the fabulous acting. And in the end, the story leads where you never expected in a genuine QT style \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u00a3", "I was there when Pulp Fiction changed cinema": "And I am here when Once Upon a Time in Hollywood changed storytelling. I give this a solid 9 out of 10. I want to watch it again, and I just got out of the theatre. It's a very special story, the kind you know the ending but still want to watch. If you are a Tarantino fan, you will absolutely love this. If you are not, chances are this is the movie that will make you one. Nostalgia is an understatement. Love this movie! Brad and Leo, perfect!", "Negative reviewers don't get the movie.": "This is a near masterpiece. Flawed? Yes. But those giving overly negative reviews either don't get QT, or aren't used to films that challenge them.", "This is ONE of the BEST from a fracking tremendous year....": "I can't say much about this bulletproof movie that has not been said. For Tarantino, this may be his most conventional, least 'Tarintinesque' feeling movie, and in my mind, is right up there with Reservoir Dogs in terms of greatness.The story was brilliant, the performances, the casting, the setting(s), everythig.Brilliant. I was happy that Parasyte won, would have taken this as well that year at the Oscars. Joker was great, but maybe not quite as great as this and Parasyte.", "Worthy of it's awards": "If you don't like the gore of tarantino movies you'll be happy with most of the movie. Honestly his best yet with an all star cast and new creative ideas it's well worth a watch even if you didn't like his older stuff.", "Phenomianl Hit from quintin Tarantino once agin": "The movie really is phenominal and will definetly be a classic for a long time", "A laid-back fable": "I saw the movie at an early screening and I liked it. I'd even venture to say that this is the best movie Tarantino has directed since \"Kill Bill\".The best way to describe this movie would be as a laid back fable, a what if story and a bit of a word play on the title \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\".Throw in some alternate history and a cautionary love letter to movies, actors and all the other elements which make up Hollywood, and you got yourself an entertaining film to watch.It is also much funnier than I expected. Pitt and De Caprio are the one-two punch combo of the movie and they deliver in spades through their performances and on-screen chemistry. Margot Robbie, the movie's third focal point, has an almost ethereal presence in the movie. Not through dialogue heavy scenes, but her almost muse like appearances.This might not be Tarantino's best movie or a masterpiece, (something\nmany seem to expect each of his movies to be) but for me at least, it is a solid cinematic effort.8 out of 10", "Tarantino's True Self": "This film Honestly like nothing Tarantino has ever done before. I don't even know how to put it into words, but I'll try.You go into a Tarantino film with a certain set of expectations about the kind of film you're going to see and how it will be rendered. With this film, I had the same expectations: Snappy dialogue, a kickin' soundtrack, lots of stylized violence and profanity, a wild cinematic execution and a non-linear narrative. We all know what makes a Tarantino film a Tarantino film. But it's also how his films make us feel that gives us the ability to recognize his work as HIS work. You don't expect any of his films to be Citizen Kane, but you enjoy it so much and appreciate his unique style that we consider him an artist, as he deserved to be considered one.When I saw this film, I didn't see the Tarantino I grew up watching. Yes, we had snappy dialogue, we had violence and profanity. Yes, we had a non linear narrative. But it was all executed in a way that was so polished and different that it did not feel as though you were watching a Tarantino film. How I felt watching it kind of took me off guard. Usually when Tarantino renders Los Angeles in a film, you get an almost comic-book kind of Los Angeles. In his films, he has a way of making LA his own. In THIS film, LA is portrayed as true to reality as possible, which ultimately enhances the realism in the atmosphere of these characters' lives. The tone and vibe is not Tarantino-like at all. This film is much darker, slower and deeper than any film he's ever done. Sure, almost of his films are analytical in some way or another, but this is centered around characters, where his previous films were centered around the narrative and cinematic execution. Sure, each of his characters were unique and had a purposeful voice, but in this film, he delves into them in a way he had never done before. A much deeper way. In fact, his characters were both stylistic and realistic at the same time, creating a balance between Tarantino's craft and this totally real world he's rendering on screen.It's the least Tarantino-like film he's ever made, yet oddly enough, at the same time, it feels like a Tarantino film. I don't know how he did it this way, but it works so well that I'm speechless. He really took his work in a different direction yet stayed true to his past style at the same time. Every single second of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was magnificent, but I felt a variety of things that I just can't convey into a sensical explanation.You have to be a true Tarantino fan to at least know what I'm talking about. You DON'T have to be a Tarantino fan to appreciate this film.", "The movie is the best, just best": "Yeah, the movie is the best of 2019, anything l will say not gonna be enough.\nThere were some scenes that l really enjoyed and wished never end.\nSharon's watching movie at cinema was the extraordinary and special. l personally will never forget that scene in my life. l am sure in the future everybody will remember this movie as classic.", "Disappointing, in fact annoying": "As a Tarantino fan, I was sorely disappointed with this picture, and I'm annoyed that I invested nearly 3 hours and the rental fee on it. This film was slow, offering banal dialogue, no real plot development, and very little action. Some Tarantino attributes were there, such as interesting characters and character interactions, cinematography, and period elements. But these features all together do not deliver a cohesive, compelling film.", "One of the rare movies I did not finish watching": "I've liked Tarantino since I saw Reservoir Dogs in theaters (I know, showing my age here). I didn't care much for Jackie Brown and was not super into Inglorious Basterds (except for Christopher Waltz amazing performance) but otherwise, always a pretty solid director.\nWhich is why I don't understand what happened here. After an hour and a half or plain nonsense I had enough and just stopped watching. Reading other reviews, half of them seem to hint at some great conclusion, the rest further confirm there is no point to it until the end. There are just too many good movies to watch out there and I have so very little time I am not ready to give this another try, sadly.", "It's an absolute must see movie": "It an awesome movie. Tarantino with his unique style and pattern made my mouth opened wide smiling through the whole movie!\nI liked how he took care of every single detail related to each character - as usual - and the ending was like: oh wow he just connected all together!\nIt's very funny - even the bloody fight was hilariously funny and this is completely weird unless the whole watching people were psychos and this absolutely proves his amazing talent.\nIt was very dramatic with breathtaking music, lighting.\nHe showed up hollywood in its glory era.\nFinally the casting; all just perfect!! Leo & Brad were perfect duo\nEvery single line in this movie worth hearing, it's like mixing all kinds of art together and watching them in the 60s editionIt's an absolute must see movie", "Tarantino's love letter to Los Angeles - And Sharon Tate": "Well where to start. This was surely something very different and in many ways very un-Tarantino, which is not a bad Thing as I liked that he gave this film a different Approach. It was also my most anticipated film of the year so of Course my expectations where extremly high wih it, especially since I am quite familiar with the Manson Murders myself.\nWhat is this movie? It is not a Biopic. This is the first Thing audiences have to understand before seeing it. It is a true love letter from Quentin Tarantino to Los Angeles and the \"good\" old days of Hollywood. And it is a personal love letter to Sharon Tate.\nAudiences and criticized it for the lack of a narrative plot it has. And they are Right, the film doesnt really. In fact there are many Scenes that could have been shortened or even cut when we just look at the narrative but it was not Tarantino's Intention to make a plot-based film. It is his Memory-piece. His \"Roma\" so to say.\nHe emphasized on the characters rather than plot and Boy he did! Both leading characters Cliff Booth and Rick Dalton are extremly exciting and you Keep Looking Forward to see what this dynamic due is doing next. It of Course helps that the Performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are undoubtly Career-best turns and absolutely Award worthy in every regard. Especially Pitt soaked his role up as he never did before. You Keep forgetting it is Brad Pitt you are watching on screen. And DiCaprio's greatest Moments is when he is playing his different characters. Exceptional Performances in any way.\nMargot Robbie perfectly interpreted Sharon Tate. No, she doesn't say a lot in the film. But the way she adapts the character in such lovely Details brought Tate back to life for at least a few Hours and it was such an angelic-performance by Tate to really nail the Person Tate was. The rest of the appearances are rather small.... many characters come and go when they pass the paths of our three leading characters. The most noteable of those small roles / cameos are for sure Bruce Dern who was extremly hilarious and Margaret Qualley who embodied the perfect \"Manson Girl\". Not to Forget the great turn of Young actress Julia Butters and also Mike Moh and Damien Leweis deserve a shout Outs for their very small roles. Al Pacino perfectly fits his role as well and it was intersting to see Dakota Fanning in a role like that.\nAnother thrilling aspect of the film is the cinematography. Pitch perfect Images and camera ankles. Also the way Los Angeles is portrayed in dawn or night are among the most atmospheric imageries I have seen in a Long time on screen. The Soundtrack is absolutely Fitting the atmosphere and was well Chosen for that period, too. Great editing and writing, too.\nAnd then that ending came..... oh Boy that ending. Well, see it yourself.\nDon't expect a film with a clear plot line but expect a real journey in time back to 1969.", "Found is somewhat boring": "I am not a Tarantino fan nor do I dislike his films some I enjoy others not so much, this unfortunately falls into the latter category for me.As usual the cinematography sets and props were all excellent, and acting was top notch (which I think can mostly be attributed to the directing by Tarantino and his eye for detail), and I think the same can be said about pretty much all of his films unfortunately the writing is where I think it fell short.I went into it believing it was a comedy which has probably soured my opinion somewhat (I literally only chuckled once and it was in the last 5 minutes), I also know little about Hollywood and any nostalgia factor really means very little for me. Although I could have easily got past it not being funny I simply couldn't get past the first two hours which, at least for me, were very drawn out slow and boring where basically nothing happened. What I considered a mundane average story only changed it's tune during the last ~30mins which I did find engaging and enjoyable but by that stage I was really only watching it to finish it and see why it had got such great reviews.I can certainly see why many others love it, on top of the good things I already pointed out I know the nostalgia factor would have helped some enjoy it more and for others the the story was probably refreshing not being a 'normal' Hollywood film with a generic A,B,C type script but unfortunately for me, not having anything invested in the movie, knowing little about the material referenced locations or time period meant that the first 3/4 was a real bore which I struggled to get through and think it may have been better if the slow first two hours of set up was condensed down to one.", "Captures the aura of an era. This is Tarantino's masterpiece": "Tarantino's long-in-the-making love letter to the 1960s, one of the decades that really influenced him as a filmmaker, is a masterpiece in directing, cinematography and storytelling, topped off by two mesmerising performances from Leonardo di Caprio and Brad Pitt. Tarantino vividly renders not only what it must have been like in the film industry in Hollywood in the late 1960s, but also the style and aura of that time. Granted, what we are given is Hollywood's memory of the decade, the stars living it up and miserable in the Hills. The Vietnam War was at it's peak in 1968/1969, but in this film it is merely just a obscure broadcast on a car radio; bulletins from battlefields insignificant to our stars as they fight their own battles in the studios and bars of Hollywood.Rick Dalton (Di Caprio) is a burnt-out actor struggling now at the end of the 1960s. The '50s and indeed this past decade have been good to him, but it now appears that he is yesterday's news. He was Jake Cahill, star of the long-running TV western show \"Bounty Law\". But now that the era of the Western is in decline, Dalton feels like he has had it. But when Roman Polanksi and his wife Sharon Tate move in next door to him, Rick wonders if he is just a pool-party away from that starring role in a big movie that he needs. His good pal and long-time stunt double is Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), and he is more optimistic than Rick, and we follow the pair as they travel around Hollywood and later, Europe, when Rick decides to give the Spaghetti Western a shot. But in the background, something dark and menacing is lurking up in the Hills, and we are headed for quite a conclusion.This is a very funny and stylish film. There are many memorable and hilarious moments and lines, such as Booth's taunting of the legendary Bruce Lee in that now infamous scene - \"Anybody kills anyone in a fight they go to jail. It's called manslaughter.\" The last ten minutes or so are completely off-the-wall and unexpected, and remind the viewer that they are watching a Tarantino flick. Brad Pitt and di Caprio are absolutely phenomenal. The scenes showing us the Western being filmed and Rick forgetting his lines are very well done and again, laced with a fine humour - \"I just want her to play the fiddle.\"", "Call nostalgia. Interesting but not great.": "As a guy in his late 50s, the nostalgia in this movie is very well done. It is interesting how Quentin Tarantino fictionalized real places, events and people. I enjoyed the movie however I guess I was expecting more. It is a good movie but I kept waiting for that \"wow\" moment. Some of the more critical reviews are probably written by younger viewers. The time frame authenticity of this movie is incredible. Everything done in this movie looks exactly like the timeframe, sounds like the time frame and even advertisements and background details that most young people will mess is detailed very very well. The movie is definitely worth a look for people born before 1965. I was not expecting so many real events altered with much different outcomes. Tarantino threw a curveball that most young people will absolutely miss.", "BORING!": "Long and boring, a story with no obvious goal. Bad script, mediocre acting, bad direction. Not a Tarantino movie. I can't believe someone paid to make this movie! Stay away, save time and money...", "Once Upon a Time in...Boringland": "If I were to have viewed this film prior to having any knowledge regarding it, I never would have guessed it to be Tarantino's work. The plot and much of the character dialogues did not resemble his work whatsoever.For the first two hours, it felt like Tarantino was trying to build tension between characters that were underdeveloped. I was almost certain that this would result in something, and that the end of the film would prove the lack of the main characters' development to be significant.When the film got to the third act it seemed as if Tarantino realized he had burned through two out of the three hours he had, as things sped up oddly fast. The ending was good and by far the most exciting part of the film, but it felt incomplete. I left the theater feeling confused and as if I missed something.The film does have its highs, set design is insane and very pleasing, and the acting is super good too. Leo's performance was one of the best ever. Camera work as always is good. With all of these factors in place, it feels as if Tarantino had the opportunity to turn this film into the best of his whole career, but forgot to add the elements that make his other films so successful.", "Great spin on the Manson story": "I was a bit concerned the movie would be self-absorbed Hollywood shtick, however QT failed to disappoint. Good story, great pace, deCaprio was bang on and hopefully sees recognition in awards season. Pitt/ Deniro initially felt miscast and only there as a mutual favour, however by the fight scene Pitt earns it back. Others have said it, it's a love letter to Hollywood, full-stop and his passion for the art/time/place shines through. The Ranch scene was brilliant start to finish.", "Long, boring, blah, blah film.": "First let me say, that I am a big fan of every actor in this film....and I usually like Tarantino films. But I cannot say many good things about \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\". This film is really boring and very long, I almost walked out multiple times.The acting was good, but Tarantino's style of jumping from scene to scene really got old in this film. And when is Tarantino going to leave the World War 2 era?I am impressed that Brad Pitt was willing to accept his role in this film, he took 2nd billing under DiCaprio. So glad to see Timothy Olyphant again, he's always entertaining. And Margot Robbie is simply one of the sexiest females to ever appear in movies.If you go see this movie, do yourself a favor and have LOW expectations, then maybe you will be pleased with it.I seriously doubt that this movie will recoup its budget.", "Nothingness": "I probably shouldn't even write a review because I only got half way through it and stopped watching because it was too boring. Every single scene and every line meant nothing and I had no interest in any character. And after reading reviews that were saying the same thing I didn't want to waste more of my time. Just another movie trying to rely on the actors to sell a movie but with no plot or interesting script even that couldn't save them.", "so disappointed!": "I am a fan of Quentin Tarantino but this one made me so disappointed:((((", "Once Upon A Time...I Walked Out": "There is no story, just set pieces of good-looking actors being good looking. Brad Pitt does \"Brad Pitt.\" Leo does his usual self-satire of a bawling actor. Whatsername plays Sharon Tate's filthy bare feet. And then there are a bunch of unknown actors doing SCTV-level impressions of other mostly unknown actors. Who cares.I've never understood America's fascination with that cross-eyed weirdo and his un-bathed followers so none of that stuff interested me in the least. Roman Polanski similarly does not interest me.This movie illustrates once and for all that if Tarantino can't spill blood on the screen he has absolutely nothing to say. I had that figured out with Jackie Brown and it was reinforced with the interminable talking scenes in the Kill Bills but this cements it.Once Upon a Time is actually worse than The Irishman, which I had previously thought was going to sail through the year as the longest, most self-indulgennt film churned out by an over-rated director featuring over-rated actors in 2019.", "don't let the negative reviews fool you": "It's more an experience than just a movie, feels like you're really there, but people always want the same thing and complain when they don't get it.\nqt likes doing his own thing and people still haven't caught on, and complain because they don't understand.\nwatch it with an open mind and no expectations. let the story carry you along, you won't be disappointed.", "F.U. Helter Skelter": "Sharon Tate avenged the best possible way - in Tarantino's imaginarium!", "D I F F E R E N T": "This movie has many similarities to his past work but don't go in expecting tons of blood and gore like his normal movies. This one makes you think a lot more than any of his past work. The chemistry between Leo and Brad is phenomenal the jokes always land and I would be extremely surprised if they both didn't get a nomination for their roles. This movie is not as good as Pulp Fiction or any where near but is one of his better movies in recent years", "Inglorious Hollywood": "In the bonus track of the DVD of \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood,\" there is a montage of deleted scenes that reveals the satirical style of writer-director Quentin Jerome Tarantino. The most typical of the scenes is a television commercial for a fictitious brand of cigarettes called Little Red Apples. The commercial drips with irony in promoting something destructive to a human body that is being portrayed in a over-the-top way not dissimilar to the actual ads of the mid-twentieth century. The cigarette commercial demonstrates in microcosm the film's overall approach to violence in the 1960s.In the film's graphic violence twisted into satire, the filmmaker attempts a retrospective of the tragic Tate-La Bianca murders of 1969 and indeed violence as a whole on one of the most self-destructive decades in American history. The humor derives from shifting the perspective on the murders and rewriting history through the lens of two Hollywood types, a grade-B movie star of the Westerns, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his sidekick stuntman, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt).The viewer is forced to slog through most of the film that seeks to present a slice of life in the Los Angeles film colony of 1969. Far too much time is spent in establishing atmosphere and stringing out scenes that are overwritten with pacing that is a slow as L.A. rush-hour gridlock. One of the most unnecessary sequences is the long stretch at the Spahn Ranch that even fails to introduce the character of Charles Manson.The film's payoff finally arrives with the fateful night of August 8, 1969, when Tarantino pulls off a \"what if\" scenario, wherein the life of the beautiful Sharon Tate is spared due to the heroics of the star of the TV program \"Bounty Law\" and his faithful and quick-thinking buddy, who is on acid at the time!The most interesting character is without a doubt the faithful Cliff Booth, as played with great gusto by Pitt. Cliff's devotion to his pal Rick has no bounds, and the character has the kind of decency that was at the heart of the stock characters and melodramatic television series built around myths of the Wild West, on which he has built his career.The film still depicts a nightmare on Cielo Drive. But it also provides some much-needed distance from the gruesome realities of the event to serve as a reference point for understanding the most violent of decades in modern American history.", "Darkest picture of Hollywood since DAY OF THE LOCUST": "Once we learn that DiCaprio's neighbors in the Hollywood Hills are Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), the viewer has an uncomfortable feeling about where this story is going to end. Except that it doesn't - exactly. Tarantino has a few tricks up his sleeve. Doesn't he always?All Quentin's trademarks are here. Weird camera angles. Sudden short flashbacks. A loud score of pop hits. Non-stop profanity. Graphic violence, of course, even before the gory climax. There's an ever-present sense of homage to yesteryear Hollywood. At 2 hours 41 minutes the movie is a long haul, and your expectations of where it's going are a major element of the suspense. ONCE UPON A TIME is more coherent than PULP FICTION or KILL BILL. Solid performances from DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are the glue that holds it together. Bruce Lee and Steve McQueen are grafted a bit clumsily onto the screenplay, along with Tate And Polanski.This is the darkest study of Hollywood since John Schlesinger's DAY OF THE LOCUST (1975). It leaves a nasty taste, but I guess that's another Tarantino trademark.", "Instantly Classic Tarantino with a Side of Foot Fettish Overload": "The anticipation for this film amongst zealous Tarantino fans seemed to hit new heights at several points through the timeline leading to its release. While the guy may strike many as an eccentric maniac, both from his splatterfest films and off-screen antics that potentially almost killed a few of his actresses, there's a settled maturity here that quietly sets itself to slowly canvassing out a fantastic film. With that, the fervent anticipation ends up being warranted, but also somewhat inappropriate. With that, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood carries itself as a top of the line film star constantly harassed by the paparazzi that ultimately wants you to quiet down and leave it alone.There's a palpable lack of urgency that bled through in the trailer which ultimately portrays the film's intentions very honestly. It's gotten to the point where most mainstream films refuse to waste an ounce of celluloid by editing down and pushing and pushing the plot through without any breathing room, a style that conjures up an image of a woman forcing herself into pants that are two sizes too small. This is about living the world, being a ride-along buddy with these characters and enjoying the great times. It is an unapologetically vintage approach that, along with flawless set design, harkens back to a period obviously close to Tarantino's heart.DiCaprio and Pitt look like they're having an absolute blast and it's incredibly infectious. DiCarprio especially appears a lock for an Oscar nomination; his comedy is riotously on point, but he can quite patiently and drastically manage to touch your heart. His character requires a deft balance between equal parts charming, tragic, talented and degenerate. He nails them all.And yes, despite everything I've just described about a more leisurely and mature film, Tarantino is still secretly that little kid who loves nothing more to steal a box of fireworks and light the whole damn thing all at once. It sure as hell happens, and it's sure as hell glorious. I really loved this film, and I think about 50% of his hardcore fans will too, give or take.Be sure to avoid the 1% that are there for QT's foot fettish tendencies because they will quite honesty blow a load. That's one part he hasn't changed.", "Homage to Hollywood": "Quentin Tarantino's film and television knowledge is undeniable, and this film shows it in all it's glory. At nearly three hours, it's a meandering tale of the era mixing truth and fiction. Great performances and a dizzying ride to the end", "Complete garbage": "Let me start off by saying I am a Quentin Tarantino fan. I find his work often intriguing and beautifully shot. Although this film was beautifully shot, that's about the only positive I can say about it. The story line lacks focus and has a script full of nonsense. I found myself bored beyond belief until the last ten minutes of the film. DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie and Tarantino could have made movie gold together, yet this is just a complete fail. I'm stunned on how critics found this even remotely captivating.", "Tarantinos Most Unique Film": "I really enjoyed seeing this last night. It was definitely Tarantino's most experimental movie, as his strengths shined at creating a hyper realistic depiction of Hollywood during the late 1960's. DiCaprio and Pitt had great chemistry together, and the comedy was very strong at certain parts. Of course, DiCaprio and Pitt do an incredible job in this movie as always. They play very well off of eachother, as their characters are unique in their own ways. As well, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate added a great touch to the historical backdrop of the film. There does not seem to be just one central plot, so the movie really just feels like a collection of relevant scenes. Movies like these feel more like an experience than just an average blockbuster. That is why I will be revisiting this movie multiple times. If you can appreciate good production, acting, and possibly one of Tarantino's most suprising endings, then it is definitely worth your time.", "Powerful climax couldn't save overall film": "This is one of those films in which you have to ignore the exorbitantly high ratings that precede the official opening of the film. Clearly a lot of insiders or self-important movie buffs inflated the rating based on the reputation of the director and maybe personal nostalgia for the era depicted in the film.. I do not think anyone could objectively deem this a \"10\" or perfect movie.It was overly-long, it dragged and dragged, and its plot was thin. I dozed off at least twice. I almost walked out I was so bored and frustrated. It just wasn't going anywhere!Then came \"the scene.\" It was everything you'd want and expect from a Tarrentino film. It shocked you into attention, shook you awake from the long slumber that preceded it. I will concede that even though as a somewhat squeamish person, I had to look away a couple times, it was an overall satisfying and invigorating climax.But it wasn't enough to save the overall film.A great film has to provide more than ten minutes of compelling footage. It has to keeps the audience's attention throughout. It has to tell a story in which the audience can follow and find some type of meaning. \"Once\" just doesn't do that.I was going to rate this film a 4, but I reconsidered because I do think \"the scene\" provides enough excitement to make the film memorable, at least short-term, and I believe that at least warrants another rating point. 5/10 is my final answer.", "Nothing really happens": "Leo is a fading star, brad a failing stunt man, margot just prances around and dances, manson actor is wasted.Best part is the parts where leo stars in the western movies and the end scene with brad the rest of it is just boring and pretty stupidThey show bruce lee as arrogant and weak, they show margot as sharron tate going in a cinema and watching herself which is clearly the real shannon and not her which is lazy.Overall has some good bits but mainly bad its just not worth spending money on", "In or Outside His Element?": "Those who know and respect the Tarantino canon might wonder what stories he has to tell about Hollywood at the end of the 1960s. Are movie actors twisted and maniacal enough to give him something to work with?Five years older than he is, I also get prickly when such stories don't jive with my own memories. This movie gets much of it correct, so there is much to admire, but still has plenty of room for dispute.QT was six years old when the Tate/LaBianca murders took place, but precocious enough to be as addicted to TV of that era as I was. On my first screening of Once Upon a Time in ... Hollywood, I counted only one mention of Vietnam, and no footage of Ronald Reagan as Governor of California, even though in at least the early 1960s he and Nancy were still just as much a part of the same swinging Hollywood scene depicted here.Call it a fine line between swaggering tough guys and Hollywood types who actually had to straddle the old glitzy era of Hollywood into that new era of sex, graphic violence, and swearing. Even Bruce Lee is depicted as a braggadocio, a far cry from his humble counterpart on the Kung Fu television series.On the other hand, it is Tarantino fantasyland, where you can still buy Red Apple cigarettes (what Bruce Willis asks the bartender for in Pulp Fiction). Add to the mix much that is historically accurate about the Manson Family and Sharon Tate, with much that is deliberately inaccurate.I can't tell if an iconic filmmaker has left his element, redefined his element, expanded his element, or stayed the same. Other than that, he's learned a lot about making films since Reservoir Dogs.", "Amazingly bad": "For first time in my life I had the urge to comment my thoughts after a movie .... simply because I was astonished how bad it was the concept of the movie. Great actors, but the script is simply worthless. Honestly, I have got so disappointed that it would be hard to watch a movie of Tarantino any time soon... can't get how that movie in particular got so high rating and even nomination!!!\nI really regretted going to the cinema. Very sad", "Great Movie": "I really felt like Tarantino came into his own with this film.", "Most boring movie": "One of the most boring movies I have seen. I felt asleep most of the time", "Surreal comedy in 70's essentials!": "I enjoyed watching every scene of this movie. The 70's classic cars, costumes, studio equipment, and LA landscape are absolutely beautiful. And I've learned that LA is and hasn't always made everyone happy.", "Fragmented, incoherent, boring, but with flashes of great moviemaking": "I really do enjoy Tarantino's work, but not this one. The plot meandered and had too many flashbacks, jump cuts, and was only marginally linear. Most of the featured actors gave brief, but outstanding performances. Many of the scenes could stand alone as terrific shorts. It's almost like he took those scenes and randomly tossed them into some editing software and then toggled the RENDER command. The final 15 minutes of the movie kept me from giving this film zero stars. So, if you decide to avoid this movie, your life will remain fully complete.", "Nothing to see here": "Writing a review on the film years later, it's February 2022 now, because I saw it pop up as I was scrolling IMDB. I was so excited to see this movie when I first heard about it, even more excited when I saw the trailer. And when I saw the movie, I immediately text my brothers and movie buff friend, that they can go ahead and skip this one. There's nothing going on here, and when you think something is going to happen, it doesn't. It's bland and boring. It's all the air in a bag of Lay's potato chips. Brad Pitt winning Best Supporting Actor was a joke. It was like he was just playing a sidekick who never amounted to anything. I think Ford Vs. Ferrari came out the same year. How did this acting best Christian Bale, or even Matt Damon? Just shows you how Hollywood treats their favorites. Reading some of the positive reviews, tells me they're fake. People commenting \"Oh, it's about the 60's, and the girls are gorgeous \". And they rated it a 9. Please! Ridiculous. Someone commented it would stand the test of time, and I read a couple reviews about how they loved the dog. Well after nearly 3 years, I don't even recall a dog in the movie.", "Yikes.": "Admittedly, I am not the biggest Tarantino fan. I usually find his gore-factor and explicit scenes unnecessary. This one was definitely no exception. Except the funny thing is I really enjoyed the first half of the movie. It didn't seem Tarantino-like at all. But then the last twenty minutes hit. First off, the sudden narration just didn't fit. Secondly, it honestly seemed like two different movies that he just molded into one. I am honestly quite speechless. I would say you have to watch it to understand what I mean...but don't watch it.", "Loved it!": "Having grown up in L.A. during the 60s, I found it very entertaining. The nostalgia is there, from brew 102, to 93 KHJ.\nThe storylines success lies in the ending, which each of us who lived through that period can identify with.\nI loved it, it'll be one of those movies I can watch over and over again.", "One of TARANTINO'S BEST": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - Movie ReviewWhere do I even begin with a movie like this. WoW, just WoW. Quentin Tarantino has out done himself. This is by far the BEST TARANTINO movie. The way he wrote and directed this movie is beyond phenomenal and amazing.Leonardo DiCpario as Rick Dalton was so good. He plays a washed up actor trying to make a name for himself again in 1960s Hollywood. DiCpario captured the essence of this role and played it to a point where this role was better than his role in Django Unchained. DiCaprio one ups himself in every scene he is in and it shows.Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth stole the show and made the movie beyond amazing. The character of Cliff Booth is the Stuntman to Leonardo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton character. The back story that is given to Cliff Booth is intense and shocking so to speak. Brad Pitt from the moment he is shown in this movie just makes the movie better. This is his BEST PERFORMANCE as an Actor and it shows.Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate. The character is not in it all that much. Maybe close to about 15mins of total screen time and that was it. The character really didn't have to be in the movie, but when you see it. You will understand why.Al Pacino finally makes his debut in a Tarantino movie. He plays Marvin Schwarzs a local Hollywood Agent. While Pacino's role was minor, he left a mark on the movie and it was good to see him portray this character.Mike Moh as Bruce Lee, was done so well. He captured the feel and look of Bruce Lee and even sounded like him. There is a great scene between Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth that is both funny and bad ass.Kurt Russell as Randy. Randy is a stunt coordinator for one of Rick Dalton's movies and also serves as the narrator for this movie. As he narrates the movie it's done in a subtle way where it keeps your attention.There are other minor actors in the movie, But they had small parts in the movie to serve as some small backstory to everyone.Now the dog, yes I said dog. The Dog that in this movie is great. I can't say much more about it, but it does play a major role in a few scenes. If there was an Oscar for animals. This Dog would WIN.The music in the movie really takes you back to the 1960s. The way Tarantino captures the feeling and emotion of the music with this story setting is unbelievable and makes the movie work so well.The cinematography in this movie is by far the BEST in any Tarantino movie. The tracking shots were smooth and clean. The editing was good and quick but added to the suspense of the movie. The interior car scenes are the best, as the camera is positioned in the back capturing both Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth.Tarantino has made a movie that is a call back to the 1960s. The ending is by far the best and most shocking. Especially the way it was done, he had intense moments that worked for a movie like this.This is a MUST SEE movie. Especially if you are a Tarantino fan, he knocked it out of the park with this one and it truly shows, and if you are not a Tarantino fan still go see this movie and you will understand why this movie is the BEST movie of 2019.Once upon a Time in Hollywood - Rating 10 out of 10", "It's just nearly a 10": "Just seen this movie for first time last night .mmm\nSeen the reviews .Mmmm Surprising .\nThis film is enjoyable but doesn't hit the mark for me .\nI just didn't think it worked, recreating history .Almost an insult to all the people that died and lived through the real life events .\n\"Helter Scelter\" 2004 does it justice and so much better .\nThis is the romantic version .The way we would have loved it to have been back in 1969 .\nBrad is very good and entertaining as Cliff Booth.Good acting by the others .However the story isn't nearly interesting enough .Although clearly intertwined into the fabric of the real events from that year .\nThe scenery is just beautifully indulgent .I loved the version of Mamas and Papas .\" California dreamin \" Just beautiful\nI wanted to love this movie so much as I'm a massive fan of Sharon Tate ,the tragic\nstory that has touched me for life .So I will probably watch it again .\nIf you are reading this .You may also care to view my tribute to Sharon on YouTube .\nSharon Tate 2019 tribute .Please leave some kind words if you enjoy that\nMany thanks", "A Labour Of Love That Celebrates All Things Cinema": "What is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? What isn't Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? It is Quentin Tarantino's love letter to the industry that's been his world all his life. It is his genuinely heartfelt tribute to Hollywood's Golden Age that basked in the glamorous, sunny scene of 1960s Los Angeles. It is his tip of the hat to spaghetti westerns that influenced his filmmaking style more than any other genre. It is his longing for the rolling reels & film stocks that's already becoming a relic of the past. It is his attempt to step out of his comfort zone & create something new that feels fresh yet familiar. And it's the final station in his directorial journey that brings him to the moment where he's more than grateful, wishes to give back & expresses his gratitude in ways that only he can.The 9th feature film by Quentin Tarantino is unlike any of his previous films. It presents the auteur in a completely new light yet brims with everything that we associate with his works. Bright, breezy, beguiling, delicious, detailed, delighting, honest, hilarious, heartwarming, vivid, vibrant, vivacious, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a labor of love that celebrates all things cinema. A beautiful & bittersweet ode to the art of crafting a motion picture, and a eulogy to a bygone era & its yesteryear icons that's painted with nostalgic brushes. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt & Margot Robbie shine throughout in what's 2 hours of Hollywood reminiscence and 45 minutes of classic Tarantino doing what classic Tarantino does best. Not his best film to date but it certainly is his grooviest & most joyous.", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)": "In his complete and detailed manner Quentin Tarantino presents us a little fairy tale in the Hollywood of the sixties that captivates and often makes you laugh. In particular, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt burn as a wonderfully crazy television stars from a veritable fireworks of memorable moments and Margot Robbie shows that behind Sharon Tate is a person with many facets.\nA great movie.8,0", "Once Upon A Time...There was a movie maker who made a pointless film": "Firstly may I say, please ignore the three sentence reviews on IMDB as they are obviously written by the studio and really have nothing to guide the movie goer in making an honest opinion of this film.\nOK, now to my review of QT's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood (OUATIH)\nWhen I heard of this films release I was excited as I am a fan of QT work and feel that he always has something to offer the movie goer and let's face it, with all the re-boots and superhero films that have flooded the market these days he is a true master of his craft......until now!.It's a well known fact that QT plays homage to classic movies bringing a fresh new look to them but this film perhaps should have been called 'Tarantino's Wet Dream'. So self indulgent that the audience has been ostracized unless you too known everything about retro TV programming (or claim to, to sound cool).\nThe film was so long without real plot and over long shots of spaghetti western scenes that had no bearing on anything and as one reviewer said 'bare foot overkill' (QT's trademark). The Sharon Tate scenes in the cinema I just did not understand why this was needed. Was this character development?, was this ..er...I just don't know.\nThe acting by these heavy weight actors was good - Brad Pitt especially and there were a few moments where there was some suspense (the Manson family ranch scene) but in a almost 3 hour long movie this was nowhere near enough - even the film 'Death Proof' have that underlying suspense throughout the film from Kurt Russell. The ending of this film has had some reviewers saying 'Wow' or 'Best movie ending ever'. Seriously, the girl who fell into the pool overacted so much I was glad when DiCaprio used the flame thrower - again WTF.\nIn all honesty I really wanted to love this film but was so disappointed by it that I will leave well alone in the future as it really was awful. I guess I missed the point but then again perhaps I didn't and it was just a bad film.", "Oscar Winning Performance by Brad Pitt!": "OMG! What a performance by Brad Pitt. Leonardo is great, too but I think Brad got a better role. Amazing acting by Brad. I will be so disappointed if he is not not nominated for an Oscar.", "An open letter of love for cinema": "\"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" is primarily in the first instance a tribute. Tribute to the golden age of 1960s cinema, a tribute to Clint Easterwood, Sergio Leone, John Wayne, Giuliano Gemma, Henry Fonda and many, many other actors and directors who marked the era, but most importantly, an honor to promising actress Sharon Tate, suddenly and cruelly murdered in the late 1960s by the followers of charles manson. This point brings us to another stage of the film, the cruel and delicious revenge posed by Tarantino.The film has a troubled script, a twist between the first two acts, as well as undeveloped characters and many scenes that are completely unrelated to the main plot, but one of these scenes has a greater meaning than serve the script, they serve as a tribute, and fulfill their role, but that does not exempt Tarantino's ninth film, famous for the scripts and already nominated for the Oscar for such a requirement to leave so many edges and screen filling during the almost three hours long, however, the other technical requirements and art are so good that these nearly three hours fly by.In terms of acting, we have no mistakes, the whole cast of the film is spectacular, from the main to the big stars, such as Brad Pitt, who is extremely comfortable and having fun in his role, the actor, who gives himself to his age and his character is a great performer and can paint on the Oscars as an adjunct, Leonardo DiCaprio is also great, doing an extremely effusive and dramatic performance, he has done nothing very different from what he has done in other roles, but still great Margot Robbie is also fine, and who deserves another highlight, although with a short appearance is Margaret Qualley, playing a sensual, dark and scary character that serves as a presentation pivot for Manson sect, another character that appears little but looks great is Mike Moh as BruceLee.Technically the film has errors, especially in transitions, cuts and continuity, but the vast majority seems to be on purpose, as a kind of controversial signature of the Director, the other points, such as ambiance, scenery composition are spectacular, a photograph extremely hot, which matches the great sixties atmosphere of the work. Another very strong point is the soundtrack, which is present here in very different ways, we have classic songs from other movies of the time, pop songs of the time, incidental tracks, and whenever a character gets in the car, we have the radio of the time playing , a small, beautiful and wonderful detail, a track that may not be as striking as Kill Bill or Pulb Fiction, but that conquer us by diversity, creating a unique context the work, which is not only on the track, the sound of the film in overall is very well edited, such as the camera angles used by Tarantino, the director knows very well how to film his actors and make the most of his performances just using the cameras, but the film editing presents problems of cohesion and continuity as already quoted.When we watched \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" we felt Tarantino's love of cinema, it is clear, the director wanted to honor in every way possible the genres that marked the age of the eighth art, and makes a film about movies for lovers of In films, this creates a detachment from the public outside this universe, the excess of visual, photographic and sound references does not make sense to the general public, who do not know exactly which core of the story to follow, since everything seems a creation of contexts to speak and honor the cinema, a large fruit salad whose script appears discreetly here or there, this is a problem. But the love of cinema exposed here does not let me dislike this feature, quite the contrary, despite some problems, is a movie made for us who love cinema we keep in our hearts.\"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" is far from perfect. but the almost three hour long is a dedication of love to the seventh art and all that involves it, music, choreography, actors and genres, a dedication, an open letter that brings eye drops to the eyes of the big screen lovers, the general public may not feel the same and get very lost and bored during the film, even with the great cast, but we can not deny, it is a cool movie that fulfills its goal and will surely be on the list of many favorites, if you like cinema, You need to watch \"Once upon a time in Hollywood\".", "\"And Now...the Hollywood in Tarantino's Head\"": "While it is no surprise that a Tarantino movie is a pastiche of his favourite movie shots, it is a surprise to realize the movie rolling across the screen is nothing more than a disjointed montage of his favourite Western scenes interspersed with newly rendered 60s movie posters, shots of vintage Hollywood landmarks, a gratuitous Playboy mansion scene where Steve McQueen tells the audience that Sharon Tate has a thing for twelve year old boys (a shot at America for expelling Polanski because he had a thing for thirteen year old girls?) and evil hippie shots. The whole meanders its way to an unexpected and cruelly sad fantasy ending.Never subtle, Tarantino overlays it all with annoyingly short but pointed snippets of music from the era and hits the audience over the head with a reminder that DiCaprio is a good actor (yes, we know). The one bright spot was Brad Pitt. He didn't need Tarantino to remind us that he has great comedic timing, it was evident in all his scenes. In the end, there is a distinct sense that the audience is watching a Tarantinoesque film that just happens to be made by Tarantino. Not his best.", "Whoa": "Fantastic. Another Tarantino masterpiece. DiCaprio dominates that role.", "Thoroughly enjoyed": "The acting was insanely good. Both DiCaprio and Pitt really made their roles come to life. The plot was also really interesting and suspenseful at times. Highly recommend.", "Nice movie...": "\"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch two old friends, an old television star and his stunt double trying to achieve any success possible. Along the final moments of Hollywood's golden age they have to find their new way.I liked this movie because I found it very interesting and different from what I expected, something that was a nice surprise for me. For one more time Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job on the direction of the movie and I believe he gave his touch in every scene. Regarding the interpretations of Leonardo DiCaprio who played as Rick Dalton, Margot Robbie who played as Sharon Tate and Brad Pitt who played as Cliff Booth, they were all very good and their combination worked really well. Finally, I have to say that \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is a nice movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because it presents very well Hollywood from a different perspective.", "Not typical story by QT": "Slow paced and almost pointless at times, this movie left me unsatisfied. I loved Hateful Eight and was looking forward to this one but it was almost a disappointment.", "A very well made yet tedious journey from Tarantino": "My quick rating - 6,9/10. Well, this is a nice little niche movie from Tarantino. If you aren't familiar at all with the Manson murders, then a bunch of this movie will make little or no sense. That won't make the movie bad by any means. I believe some pretty good performances were turned in by all, for the most part. Although zombie Margot Robbie was a little distracting as Sharon Tate. Anyway, the movie follows the lives of a few Hollywood B listers in late 60s Hollywood, and the intertwining of their lives with the events of the Manson murders. That is a very blanket statement way of covering this, as a few Quentin inside jokes are slipped in along the way, most likely a lot more than I noticed on one viewing. Big nod to Bruce Lee though. I think Tarantino used his clout to try and make a movie to show off a bit of his friendships he has made and the knowledge he has about movies in general, to a good extent for the movie, but also about the only drawback to it. The length of this movie got tedious when it wasn't needed. Put that aside, and the movie wraps itself up, two hours and 40 minutes later, with a not so satisfying ending. It was just far enough off to make it more fiction. Maybe that was done for the sake of it being a movie more than a documentary, I really couldn't tell what they were shooting for at that point. But again, this is not a knock on the film, the movie has typical Tarantino blood abound, when need be, good one liners and fitting humor. Everyone is expecting Pulp Fiction all over again, even I will admit I often think about when he might capture that brilliance again. That is my fault for thinking that way, though. I doubt I am alone when doing that.", "More mature Tarantino with less violence but still a great movie": "It's hard not to have very high expectations of a Tarantino movie but this film didn't disappoint.The acting of all the leads is superb and some of the scenes in the film are pure brilliance.It is not his best film but to be honest that is such a high bar to hit, it says more about Tarantino than it does about this film. It's still great.", "Lame": "I have just finished watching the ego trip of Quentin Tarantino, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" I am old enough to have remembered those days and those songs and my memories are more entertaining than this movie. Having been soft-headed enough to have bought the movie, I also sat through some dreadful \"bonus\" material, which instead of being interviews and insights into the film, were repetitive out-takes from the movie.\nDon't believe the reviews: this movie was slow to the point of boredom. The dialogue felt like improv and the action we hoped would wake up the tedium was in the last 10 minutes and then petered out.\nWhat a disappointment. I really thought this movie would have sly humor and edgy action but instead it edited in scenes from old tv shows and movies of the era and acted like it had created something original. Heck you can watch Movieland and see the real thing for free.", "Future Classic": "Like Inglorious B******ds, audiences are invited to join Tarintino in his parallel universe of historic events altered, Tarintino style, which is shown in the last half an hour of the motion picture.Proven to be historically accurate in the first two hours of the film, Quentin's exploration of the life of Sharon Tate in the first 6 months before her death is portrayed beautifully by the performance of Margot Robbie along with the beautiful cinematography of Los Angeles during the last definitive years of Hollywood. We then delve in to the night of her death where the build up intensively reminds those who know of the Charles Manson murders well enough will understand what is about to occur. That's where the fictional characters come in; Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Pitt). An actor living next door to a famous film director is any actor's dream, but not when you live near one of Manson's targets. Tarintino invites these characters to fight against members of the Charles Manson family with plenty of blood and violence to kill them off Tarintino style, leaving Sharon Tate happily alive to live on.Both historically accurate and fictional fun, Quentin Tarantino juxtaposes his characters along famous movie stars at the right place at the right time, leaving audiences to wish that the events of the last half hour of the film were actually real", "This film is unsure of itself.": "I found this film to be a bit of a mess. Moreover, I couldn't understand why Tarantino insisted on putting adds for a Bitcoin casino on the screen every 5 minutes.I also found that the print of the film was grainy and dark. The sound was horrendous too. It was as if the cinematographer used his home video camera to shoot the film... maybe this is how films were in the 1960s?Hopefully these issues will be sorted for the Blu-ray release.", "Lackluster": "Let me start off by saying, scenes from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood are really quite great, but as a whole, the film is just seriously lacking in depth. This is easily Tarantino's most underwhelming film. About halfway through, I realized this isn't a piece of historical fiction that was going to graphically display the Sharon Tate murder. But instead, was actually an alternative reality about \"what might've happened\" mixed with this awkward \"what the real life of Hollywood stars is like\". Which made for an awkward movie-going experience. All criticism aside, the ending was fantastic. I'll sound like a sadist for a second, but Tarantino is known for his graphic and violent scenes, and I got just a small taste of that. However, I think Tarantino would have done a much better job showing the Manson followers slaughtering Sharon Tate and her guests. I suspect he didn't do that because he didn't want to be predictable. Ultimately, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood left me upset that I paid money to see it. Even worse, the guy behind me in the theater fell asleep. I think his response is a pretty accurate summary of what the entire film experience was like.", "Awesome movie.": "This movie prove that again leo is an wonderfull actor.", "Blissful": "Immerse yourself in 1969, kick back, and enjoy the scenery, because the attention to detail is mind-bogglingly brilliant.\nDon't take it too seriously, but watch carefully, because every scene has been artfully crafted. As with almost all Quentin Tarantino films, the actors appear to be having a ball and, consequently, turn in witty, profound and enviable performances. I found myself urging it to go back to the start just so I could bask in its beauty all over again, and again and again. So much to enjoy here, all powered by Tarantino's glorious mischief. Keep an open mind, don't stress about comparing it to anything else, and revel in every moment. I did.\nAnd when it's all over, download or buy the soundtrack. You won't regret it.", "Further proof that Tarantino does genre like no one else": "Vivid, relaxed, nostalgic and indulgent, Tarantino's 9th film is, by its own small stroke of brilliance, a near complete divergence from his previous works. As a slow burner, this film notably values character above plot, and has a loose structure that seems to lack in the urgency that drives works such as Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained. Nonetheless, in true Tarantino fashion, it delivers an acting masterclass, and serves as proof that Tarantino does genre pieces, and shows versatility in the face of expectation, like no one else.This film isn't for everyone. But don't let that stop you for enjoying you what it is - another brilliant film.", "Unique and good": "Its not Tarantinos best movie. There are parts that feel spoofy but all around it was a good movie and fun experience. I think it is also Leo's best acting performance since the aviator.", "You'll like it": "It's like a slightly better version of The Nice Guys.", "Nice ideas, pretentious execution. Tarantino in a nutshell": "I was honestly expecting this movie to be worse. Seeing this film was a reminder to myself that even if I think Tarantino films are typically disappointing, I feel they are disappointed because I see a lot of good stuff and potential in much of the content. I just get annoyed at certain decisions regarding the execution.I've seen less than half of his films. But I've seen and heard enough to where I feel the ideas are generally good and many of the components are successful. Once upon a time... in Hollywood was no exception.I love the idea of tweaking history and telling an old known story in a new way or creating a new story in an old way. I also like scenes which have a lot of dialogue and I like non-linear storylines or editing that makes one question if the story is or isn't being shown in a linear manner. I also don't take issue with seeing violence or dark and mature content within a movie.This issue I have is that the Tarantino films I've seen seem too interested in having these sorts of components for the sake of them being part of Tarantino's brand. At times it seems the integrity and intrigue of the story takes a backseat to the style. Rather than the style supporting the story for the sake of the story being told in the best way possible.Certain scenes seem to drag on and on. I don't care if a scene or sequence of dialogue takes up a lot of time. Some of my favorite movies have these attributes. I'm not suggesting his films ought to conform to rules or norms about runtime or pace of sequences. I take issue with many Tarantino scenes seeming and feeling like they take a long time to get close to nowhere. Especially when other parts of the story go by at a standard or even quick pace.For instance the scene where Brad Pitt's character goes to see his old work colleague at the Manson hippie commune went sooooooo slowly. Some people certainly appreciated it. And It would have been awful to not build the tension. But I felt the attempt of tension building was so excessive that I was eventually felt annoyed rather than concerned. This isn't the first Tarantino film to make me feel this way.I was also annoyed during the climactic fight sequence the way one of the characters died by flamethrower, while in a pool. The flamethrower itself as the weapon was awesome and well established within the story. But putting the character in the pool was stupid. How hard is it to avoid being burned to death when you're already in a freakin pool? I don't care what fighting trauma you have from shortly before. It's natural reflexes to fall down or crouch to avoid a blaze of fire shooting at you. Even if you couldn't see the flames because you're covered in blood, you could feel them and sense that you're in a pool.It would have been an easy story fix for Leo's character to not have a pool. He could have been on a lounge chair outside instead. Or just had a pool somewhere where it wouldn't feature in the climactic battle with a flamethrower.I'm sure some Tarantino fans will object to all of this and find a way to try to explain the actual \"genius of it all\". They have every right to delude themself. But it's not going to work on me.No artist one respects should be held to seemingly no potential negative standard as long as their work has their original off-beat \"brand\". A brand isn't a synonym for fine-art. And if it you repeat your brand over and over, it's no longer original.", "After a rewatch it gets better": "I first rated it 6/10, but my viewing conditions weren't optimal so I bought the Blu-Ray. The best aspect about this movie is the depiction of an era, to achieve that the production design was well-thought. Plus, the scenario is original, and each dialogues are well-written and entertaining. However, I wasn't able to give it a 8/10 because, in my opinion, Tarantino failed to capture the moments when you wanted to be entertained and those where you wanted to be serious which results in some scenes that aren't respectful for the real life people involved in the story.", "This movie is garbage": "It's the worst movie I've seen.It's boring, arrogant and annoying. It's full of meaningless talks, scenes and crazy narcissism. The feet shots made me wanna puke. The way it tells the story is terribly boring.

My favourite since Pulp Fiction.", "Terrible": "Great cast and visuals but changing a tragic story that did happen to Sharon Tate and to the others that night is just a terrible idea especially if the outcome is nothing else just a complete mess of reality and fiction.", "God, make it stop, make it stop": "He can make fun of Nazis and kill them in an alternate reality revisioning because that's what we all want to see done, but using the Tate Labianca murders as an alternate reality to explore hollywood and violence in US culture seems like a reach, theoretically as well as in Tarantino's actual movie, it's a mess, with weird shifts in tone and energy. And yes, every so often, little scenes that were great, like between Dicaprio and the precocious child actor. Mostly, however, it's a mess, off putting, not because it's difficult art but because it doesn't work, scene after scene for almost 3 hours. Would have walked out but I was waiting to see how Tarantino would land this smoking wreck - it wasn't pretty, there were no survivors.", "A fantastic blend of fact and fiction.": "Before you watch this movie, make sure you know about Charles Manson, Shannon Tate, and the story of Manson's \"family\".The film will make a lot more sense.

First it's VERY LONG and YES it feels like it. The first two hours were SLOWWWWW but it gets more interesting for the last near hour. Margot Robbie was so luminous and alive as the movie Star Sharon Tate. I loved her performance even though I would have loved to see more of her earlier in the movie. Leonardo DICaprio was terrific also. Brad Pitt's character was tedious throughout I felt. It was wonderful to see Luke Perry in his final movie role if only for a brief period of time.

He's always just rightMeanwhile DiCaprio, as if challenged by a mentor, unleashes a rousing, and occasionally astonishing, performance as the self-doubting, about to be washed-up and TV has-been Rick Dalton. But still, threads of late 1960s Jack Nicholson are obvious on the surfaceDoubtless benefitting from both the advantages of experience and chronological age (he's just old enough to remember Woodstock, Altamont, perhaps even contemporaneous TV news stories of the Manson murders that signaled the tail end of the 60s), Pitt comes out on top and wins the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award going awayLong-legged Sarah Qualley is delightful and merits special mention as the mercurial, manic hippie chick and Manson disciple, PussycatFor those familiar with the actual, brutal and evil events of August 9 1969, Margot Robbie presents as an indistinguishable, breath-taking and alas, heart-breaking 21st century Sharon Tate.

In contrast, OUATIA is narratively obtuse and delivers a less impactful, although pleasantly surprising rewarding, finale ... and yet, after such an arduous buildup, Tarantino's tale concludes with a payoff puttering well short of the concussive climax of say, Erich von Stroheim's even longer (reconstructed, 3hr 59min exemplar version of 1924's) Greed.Take note: Hollywood's popcorn audiences will be left doubting whether the trip was worth the rideWatch OUATIA (8.6/10 stars), go home and immediately re-watch Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (8.4/10 stars). Decide for yourself which movie best depicts Hollywood and which one most closely reveals Hollywood in Hollywood's imageEither way, both efforts are abiding contributions to the unpredictable art of American filmmaking", "The Emperor has no clothes": "Once upon a time in Hollywood, there was a famed Director-Emperor who mainly based his movies on violence. Sometimes he combined it with a pinch of humour (\"Pulp Fiction\", \"Django Unchained\"). He carefully selected his soundtracks; maybe he should have become a D.J... As for substance, there was none.Rhythm and editing looked masterly, yet chiefly relied on violence. Nonlinear plots were praised, even though they were no innovation by far. Spirit seemed offbeat, whilst actually violence had become mainstream since long (Peckinpah, De Palma, Scorsese, John Woo, spaghetti westerns, etc.). Depiction of violence was deemed entertaining, however it was complacent and morally dubious. Style looked cool, but resembled video-clips'. Overall, if his movies were no better or worse than many Hollywood action pictures, they rapidly became cult, demonstrating that haemoglobin and flashy style always are easy pleasers.Despite his box-office hits, our Director was sometimes melancholic. He longed to prove he was an accomplished director not limited to a genre; he wanted to do something different, a movie without much bloodshed: yes, a real opus with content and not just form. He could do it! So he directed \"Jackie Brown\" in 1997, and fans realised the Emperor had no clothes: without violence, it had nothing to show. Hence he afterwards reverted to the same good old gorish style.The vision of content still lingered in his mind, though. Time was getting short: he had promised he would only direct ten movies in his career. According to his own account, he directed eight before 2019 (more by other accounts, but we would not want to be deprived of additional masterpieces, would we?). Hence the next one, his ninth, had to be the good one! (He could afterwards crown his career with what he could do best, an apotheosis of unrestrained brutality.) He had a plan; he would not make the same mistake as for \"Jackie Brown\", where setting was contemporary: he would direct a period movie, depicting the past and actual persons to miraculously generate content. So he directed \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\". And the Emperor was naked again.There is no rhythm, since there is practically no violence to support it. The movie drags on and on for 2h40. Scenes are uselessly long: Sharon watches the film she plays in; Cliff goes to Spahn Ranch; Rick plays in \"Lancer\" series. The latter does not show anything about directing; it is not interesting; it is barely parodic; it is not funny. Even some short scenes make no sense, for instance Rick and his wife unboarding the plane: what is the point of the slow motion? If the movie were cut down by a full hour, it would not be radically different. By contrast, the most memorable part is the carnage at the end, reviving Tarantino's good old style with energy and macabre farce. Spot on.There is no consistent story, rather a succession of scenes. It would be fine if there were some substance, but there is none, as opposed to good pictures about Hollywood as we will see.Despite the title, there is no insight about Hollywood, as opposed to Sunset Blvd. (1950) or The Player (1992) or Trumbo (2015). Location and era are just a background, a pretext to make a period movie. Granted, there are references to Hollywood pictures, including Tarantino's, but without much purpose.There is no historical accuracy since the so-called \"Manson family\" is depicted as a bunch of pathetic amateurs failing their mission, instead of dangerous killers. What is the point of a ludicrous ending instead of showing compassion for five actual victims (of which an eight-month pregnant woman)? Actually, Tarantino is not interested by history, as show \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"Django Unchained\" which deform grave events (WWII, slavery): at best, they would be uchronias. Some call it artistic licence, I call it lack of respect.There is no character depth, as opposed to The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) or The Big Knife (1955) or The Last Tycoon (1976). Rick feels his career is behind him and... well, that's it. We don't know anything else about him, nor do we about all other characters. Many are based on actual persons, but we learn very little about their life.There is little humour, as opposed to The Artist (2011) or Hail, Caesar! (2016). Some dialogues are funny, but spread over such a long time, they represent an average of one every half hour.There is a stretched racist scene whereby a stupid arrogant Asian (Bruce Lee) makes a fool out of himself and then is ridiculed by a smart strong white man (Cliff). It is aggravated by the fact Mike Moh is the only non-white actor of the plethoric cast, which already says something about the movie (for info: there were ethnic minorities in 1969 USA). Tarantino is not racist, but the scene, intentionally or not, certainly is; anyone who does not believe so is probably not Asian. A typical mistake from a director who does not really think about the potential impact of his work. As a side note, if Cliff is just a stuntman, he does not stand the slightest chance against Bruce Lee; he might be a martial arts expert, but since we don't know anything about him, we cannot tell.So \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" slowly flows by. It is not terrible, just mediocre: without violence, nothing stands out. Interestingly, it not only exposes its own downsides, but by contrast Tarantino's other movies' main deficiency: over-reliance on easy violence as a fig leaf for lack of substance.I don't have an issue with action pictures, as long as they are technically and ethically decent (which to be fair Tarantino's partly are), and are not taken for more than what they stand for: entertainment. But I have trouble understanding why Tarantino should be praised more than other directors of the genre. And I do have an issue with unnecessary, complacent and dubious depiction of brutality. Fortunately \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" is Tarantino's ninth movie: one more and he will be relieved from his promise. As will we.PS: Apologies to Tarantino fans for this firm review, even though I refrained from expanding upon Tarantino's decades-long passivity in the Weinstein affair.", "Worst QT movie ever made!": "I was so bored I almost left halfway through the movie but I stayed hoping it would get better and I was wrong.\n3 hours of my life wasted and no plot whatsoever.", "A bit too much Tarantino, but still a decent film": "One of the problems that great directors run into as they start to acquire fame is that they become so popular that everyone around them becomes a \"yes man\" and won't refine the director's vision, edit them, and restrain some of their obsessive tendencies. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino unrestrained. There's excess all over this thing, from the unnecessarily long run-time to the constant bare feet shoved in front of the screen. This doesn't mean that he is so unhinged that the movie as a whole is a disaster. On the contrary, there are still some great elements in this film, despite its tendency to ramble on to a nearly exhausting degree. First and foremost, the acting is stellar. Brad Piitt is his usual charming self, and makes this stunt double into someone every guy would love to have as a friend. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect as the actor struggling with the inevitable shift in his career from leading man/hero to supporting role/villain.As for how this movie handles the whole Manson family thing, I thought that was fine. It might have been more impactful to me if I was more knowledgeable about the history related to them, but I knew enough to appreciate this film and how it handled the historic tragedy. I genuinely loved the big climactic scene, and it's not just because this was the most interesting part of the film (since something of note was happening.) It has this cathartic wish-fulfillment quality that you don't see many other film-makers attempt. I only wish it felt more like the satisfying conclusion to a story, but there was so little structure to Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood. The entire thing felt like a series of small vignettes featuring a number of loosely-connected people, and then they all come together in the end for a big finish. It's one of those movies where I simply felt like things were happening rather than a story was being told, which is a pet peeve of mine. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is definitely lower-tier Tarantino for me, even though it will be a favorite to others.", "Why not 10/10": "I am a Tarantino fan and I really wanted to give the movie highest score but there was an absence of something and that fact did not work. The movie has comedy gold, but if you saw the trailer you have seen most of it. There is also mondain life of the actors which gets boring after 2 hours. But the final act delivers and delivers good. If you saw previous works by Tarantino you know what to expect and I loved everything about it but I expected all the movie to be like this. Still a solid movie with great final act. You should watch it if you haven't.", "Most enjoyable movie I've watched in years": "A cinematic ride.

It's Dazed and Confused meets Big Lebowski in the 60s directed by Quentin Tarantino. I enjoyed it, and there's a lot to appreciate about it, but like many have said before me, Tarantino needs an editor that can takes the reigns away from him a little bit like Sally Menke did before her unfortunate passing.", "What a terrible movie": "What was the point of this awful film? It was almost 3 hours of the lousiest part of the 60s. I have been a massive movie fan my entire life but this one gave me the absolute worst feeling of movies. If you can remember having the worst flu/fever of your life and all the terrible sweaty feelings it gave you, this movie recreated that for me. It was pointless and I think designed to make you feel sick.This does not take away from the performance of the all-star cast nor the set design and anamorphic camera work. But the writing was terrible. A pointless movie. I gave it a 4 for the aforementioned decent things. I took away 6 for the rest.", "Not Tarantino's best work but not his worst film either": "Was not as good as I had expected it to be. Nevertheless, Leo should have won best actor for his role. Brad Pitt is awesome, as always. The whole Sharon Tate story line was an utter waste of time and completely boring.", "Did Not Like!": "I found it too boring and very confusing. Wow, what a horrible trash movie, there are even some cool scenes, but nothing, I hated it !!! I think it showed the follies of the time, but I found the plot very crazy and for me it was meaningless. Wow.The filmmaker is the American Quentin Tarantino, who directed among others: Hound Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence (1994), The Hated Eight (2015) and A Drink in Hell (1996). Protagonists, we have American actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who did among others: The Origin (2010), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) and Titanic (1997). Another protagonist is also the American actor Brad Pitt, who did among others: Mr. & Mrs. Smith John Smith (2005), The 12 Monkeys (1995), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).", "retirement needed": "Have watched all of tarrantinos films and enjoyed all ! All good things come to an end and this for me is not in anyway the cherry on the cake ! A film made by who ? Whoever made this has misplaced his talent !", "So Boring I Had to Leave After 2 Hours": "I just couldn't take the lake of a story line, once upon time nothing happened with A Listed actors...\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2026", "Snoozefest": "Tarantino is clearly making these movies for himself and only himself at this point.Why are there like 5 scenes in this movie of people just driving (seriously there are multiple scenes of Brad Pitt just driving his car while you look at him and nothing else happens)? I seriously get the feeling Tarantino is just trolling us at this point.There is no coherent plot or any character resolution, multiple scenes just have women's dirty feet in your face for several minutes at a time for no reason other than it makes Quentin's peepee hard.The final scene is also too ridiculous even by Tarantino standards.Used to love the guy, Basterds is my of my all time favorite movies, but this was just boring.", "My State My Era": "Guess you either love this movie or hate. I loved it. Probably my favorite Quentin movie. Resonated on many levels for me growing up in California during this time. I thought the acting was superb and Pitt was every bit deserving of his Oscar. It also resonated for me as I'm on the tail end of my career. Sure sign I like a movie is when I watch it multiple times in a week. This is a different movie that worked for me on many levels. I say check it out.", "Couldn't finish it.": "I'm a fan of Tarantino's films but not this one. I found it utterly boring. It is the first movie I've ever walked out of without finishing. Even the ton of well known stars and music from my youth couldn't overcome the dullness of the story as it slouched along. Don't waste your money.", "A Very Nice Movie": "I never thought I would ever call a Tarantino film nice, but that is just what this is. It has all the markers of a Tarantino movie yet it feels very different at the same time. At it's most basic level it is simply a light-hearted buddy film but with a slow-building sense of dread that leads to an explosive conclusion.Great job on everyone\u00c2\u00b4s part and the film really makes you believe it is 1969 again.", "Quentin, have you ever been ashamed of yourself?": "OK, where to begin? Naturally, the movie is perfectly conceived, technically brilliant, extremely inventive etc. So, from these points of view alone, the movie deserves a 10, or at least a 9. So, why rate it with a 1? Two reasons. First, this movie is self-indulgent in the extreme. No director except Tarantino could get away with stuff like this. To me, Tarantino brought something new to movies with Reservoir Dogs, and then, he started repeating himself. And I am sorry to say that 'Once upon a time...in Hollywood' brings even less novelty to the table (an object SO loved by Tarantino) than any of his other movies, if possible. And, this is even more unforgivable because the movie does not really projects what it felt to live in 1969. Younger people could not know this, but Tarantino and older people do know. So, it's a cheat within a cheat. Anyway, now to the second unforgivable problem. This movie disrespects people and their suffering. This is not the first time Tarantino does it, remember for example Inglorious Basterds, anyone? But the fact that this latest movie disrespects the suffering of a much smaller number of people than Inglorious Basterds does not make this alright.So, to me, enough is enough. All can add is this: since Tarantino has the narcissism of stating everywhere that he has pre-determined the number of movies he is going to make and that his director carreer is therefore soon reaching its end, let that career end now. And stop counting two movies (or three?) has a single one. And do not touch Star Trek, please.", "The most boring pointless movie you will ever see.": "I wish I could get those three hours of my life back. The actors are good but the story is really pointless and leaves you wondering why is this a thing and what is the point of this. I feel sorry for anyone who actually bought this movie or paid to see it in theaters. I feel I got ripped off from just renting this abomination of a movie.", "best movie ever": "Best movie ever tarantino brad and leo are genius very interesting and deep movie not for everybody", "Tarantino is the new Woody Allen": "Once upon a time... many people (me included) thought that Woody Allen had some talent. But at some point something happened, his movies became boring and pretentious.So now something similar has happened to Tarantino, I really liked his earlier movies. But come on, what is this latest POS? This is not what movies are supposed to be. Do yourself a favor and stop making movies, and just let people remember Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction.", "Long, boring and pointless - AWFUL": "If it was possible to rate 0 stars, I would have done. 3 hours of absolutely dire, pointless, unending garbage, building up to the usual Tarantino round of gratuitous violence in the last few minutes. Absolutely do not waste your time or money watching this rubbish.", "has tarantino heard of editing": "This was just long for the sake of being long...well acted, especially by brad pitt, but the plot was boring. could've been at least an hour shorter. then you have a weirdly comedic scene of graphic violence- my issue with that is it's based on real events. if it wasn't, maybe it would be easier to sit and absorb the movie, but it was extremely jarring.", "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood: Great actors with a poor fairy tale.": "Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a television star who has a career going downhills, and his stunt double/friend, Cliff Both (Brad Pitt) tries to help him with everything he asks. Meanwhile, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is living his best life in Hollywood.That's the plot. Don't expect anything else. This movie is a dramedy that should last half of what it actually does. 2 hours and 10 minutes of this movie are full of drama about how bad is Rick's career going. And showing us how he is a really good actor. On the other side of the story, we will see how Cliff is doing with his career that is also going downhill but he is hot so who cares. Meanwhile, Sharon Tate is just there for people to see how gorgeous Margot Robbie is, also to make us love her in case she's killed by the Manson family, you already know what really happens.I didn't like this movie, but I didn't hate it either. Allow me to explain myself; I wanted to like this movie because I love the Sharon Tate case. Also, I think that Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are amazing actors. And they were pretty good. Leonardo DiCaprio carries the whole movie; I love most of his scenes, he's charming and it makes you love him. Even when the story is boring, you really want to see what Leonardo DiCaprio is going to do next.Brad Pitt has a great scene, and it's the Bruce Lee scene. That scene alone is the second best thing in the whole movie. But that's it with Brad Pitt's character. He has a scene in Rancho Spahn that is superficially tense but I actually find it quite useless.The ending is whole other level. It's full of action, and it has been so far the best of the whole movie. But it feels like another movie so I don't know. I would like having more scenes like that in this movie.This movie gets 5 out of 10 because it's so slow and boring sometimes but the acting is so great that saves the movie.", "Lower echelon QT.": "An ode to the Golden Age of Tinseltown, this 1969-set odyssey tackles a bunch of topics: celebrity culture and its excesses, the rockiness of acting as a career, the importance of true friendships, and the fragility of peace during the Vietnam War era. Of course, being a Quentin Tarantino picture, this story is told with an abundance of panache; his encyclopaedic knowledge of the cinematic world lending itself to a thoughtful, reference-riddled peek behind the curtains. The 'on-set' sequences are fascinating in their own right. QT has long since been his own genre thanks to his singular filmmaking voice, but his latest could arguably be his most straight-forward movie yet. For all its side-tracking subplots and final act swerve, it is, first and foremost, a bromantic drama. As over-the-hill star Rick Dalton and his loyal stunt double Cliff Booth, Leo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt fuel the show on sheer charisma; Leo's larger-than-life personality wonderfully offset by Pitt's calm and collected demeanour. It's actually a surprisingly sweet tale, Tarantino's trademark vicious spirit, profanity-laden dialogue and hyper-violence largely (but not completely) dialled back in favour of more traditional narrative beats and rose-tinted historical revisions. Maintaining such a ridiculously high standard across his body of work, this is clearly lesser QT though, sitting in the lower echelon of his CV. There's a slightness to this outing not normally present in his films, his decisions here seemingly safer and less interesting than normal. Lacking in truly memorable moments, Once Upon a Time coasts by on the charm of its cast (including an appealing Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate) and Tarantino's impressively high base-level flair.", "Don't waste your money, let alone your time.": "Hands down the worst film I've ever seen. Completely pointless.", "King of Cool": "Fantastic movie QT's best yet. It truly felt like 1969. The world needs more films like this.", "A lot of screen time and not enough story": "I read multiple reviews saying the movie is boring. I didn't find it boring at all. It kept me entertained. The pace was slow - something I am used to with episode content where characters have time to develop. To me this movie felt like a long episode of a show, something half way season 2.The cinematography is amazing, the acting was excellent.Margot Robbie started to annoy me; the entire movie she is smiling and dancing and says like 20 words in total. She's like a princess living in a dream world and I guess it was Tarantino's thing to show what we all wanted to happen to her, hence \"once upon a time in Hollywood\". I was just longing for character development, and not just with her.\nThe criticism is that I want to see episode 3, 4, 5, etc.Not a bad movie. Tarantino pissed me off with the Hateful Eight - a simple and lazy story disguised as something complex, 90% boring dialogue and some violence. This one I enjoyed much, much more. It's just not something I'll remember for long.That said, I share the same love for Hollywood/LA, but from my personal (contemporary) experience, and I could feel his love for an era and connect me, even though I was never there myself at the time.", "Deus Ex Tarantino": "I saw this movie at the theater and didn't really know what to make of it so I didn't write a review. Now, I've rented it on Prime and watched it two more times. This movie doesn't really have a plot. It is mostly about Rick Dalton, an aging TV cowboy star and his anxiety over what he thinks is a fading career.\nThere are a number of great scenes and outstanding performances by all. The dialogue is up to Tarantino's incredibly high standard.The first time I watched it I thought I was watching a tragedy until... 'POW! ZING! BOOM! Quentin does another rewriting of history this time outdoing his machine gunning death of Hitler.I don't really get it. Yes, it makes for a much more pleasant conclusion of the movie and it magically snatches Dalton's career out of the ashes but what is depicted on screen IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED IN REALITY. Usually, Q's audacity leaves me shaking my head in a good way and I have to admit he had me doing it, here, as well but it is just a hollow Hollywood trick.That is not the way it ended for Sharon Tate who is played wonderfully by Margot Robbie. And it left me feeling bad when I was thinking about the actual Sharon Tate and the horror of her, her unborn child and her friend's deaths.Great meandering spectacle that captures the freewheeling Hollywood of the late 60s. And it feels like an indie 60s movie without the added film grain and soundtrack pops. It's just this particular rewriting of history feels like a cop out.", "A...\"what if\" ... done very well": "Answer this quick: Who is faster - Superman or the Flash?How about this one: Who would win in a fight, Robin or Kato from The Green Hornet?Or this: Could Muhammad Ali beat Mike Tyson?These are those nagging question for some that when asked, everyone has a view on. And there is really no right or wrong answer as there is passion on both sides of these questions.This...is another take on the same concept, and it works very well. Quentin Tarantino takes a question that has been floating around for decades and gives us a look into \"what if\" or...as every fairy tale begins, \"Once Upon A Time\".We get taken back to the 50s and 60s and how Hollywood was. Now I've gotta be honest, as I watched I sat there trying to figure out who was a composite of whom in Hollywood. For me, it was like trying to figure out who the character Warren Beatty was in \"Shampoo\" when I wasn't even around to understand it back then (i saw it 13 years later after it was out!), however it was fascinating to read it was a cross between Jay Sebring and Jon Peters. And this movie..has that Jay Sebring in it.And that was the interest for me in this, and where Quentin does what he does well - mix the pulp, but give you lots. There was lots of nostalgia, and lots of \"tell\" of the Hollywood industry - back then...and some of now. Leonardo Di Caprio played what I saw as - \"every actor in the world\" - he was known and at the cross roads in his career, and his only friend was his stuntman played by Brad Pitt. Yeah -- you get that Brad's character should have dumped him years ago and went out on his own, but by the end of the film, you got something that is few and far between in Hollywood...\"real friends\". And you get to the point in the film where friendship is faced with \"the end of the road\".There are great \"cameos\" in the film of both ACTORS and CHARACTERS of that time such as seeing the late Luke Perry made me choke up a bit, and it was full of \"Tarantino -isms\". The film may be long to some, I found the length fine. I found the story of this friendship coming to a head around one of the worst occurrences in Hollywood in the late 60s, done well. But make no mistake, the whole thing is based in a fairy tale, one that has all the fairy tale trappings including a happy-ever-after.And you know what? After watching this and knowing what I know -- what we all know -- yeah, I wished it would have all ended that way. I wish the world was wonderful, and people were nice and kind, and that Hollywood wasn't so dog eat dog...maybe...Once Upon A Time....Once Upon a Time. Ah-ha!A great break from all the Special Effects and Superhero films - a great entry into the nagging question and the fantasy aspect of it playing out -- while \"telling\" on Hollywood. (Make no mistake, Tarantino DID tell a lot of stories in this one!!!) This is truly...a great film.", "A piece of art.": "I thought this movie was amazing. The cast had amazing chemistry and this was another very creative idea straight out of Quentin's mind. Although, this movie is not for everyone. I feel like after people see the movie it's either they love it or they don't. Sometimes it's like that for other Tarantino movies as well. In my opinion, I loved this film and I thought they did a phenomenal job. That's just my opinion though. It all really just depends on the type of person that's watching the movie.", "Nothing!": "Wtf was this? 2hr41min total waste of my time.Cannot believe that this movie has an imdb rating of 8.0, can someone explain how that is possible?nothing happened for the whole movie, sometg was going on for the last 10 minutes but i did not care for any of the persons in the movie... so meant nothing to me.", "Thoroughly entertaining throughout!": "The people who say this is boring and plotless, are the same kind of people who said Pulp Fiction was a disconnected mess of nonsense without any plot. This is an absolute win for Tarantino, and is one of his most unique and original films.", "A real marmite film, but I love marmite": "This may be my favourite Tarantino film, he makes you feel that you have traveled back in time to 60s California, Pitt and de DiCaprio are excellent in the main roles, and the supporting cast were also excellent, I could have done with a bit more of Margot robbie as sharon Tate as I thought she was amazing in the role, not as violent as other Tarantino films, well until the final 10 minutes, but I absolutely felt like I was back in the 60s, his use of music was, as always, spot on, this is not a film that all will enjoy, but I did, and I will definitely go back to see it again", "When five stars mean something else, QT could have done better": "In my humble opinion, a movie with extremes reviews, highs and lows, it is usuallly better than having lots of 5s or 6s. I think 5 or 6 is like we are voting for a dull movie. This is the case, at least from me. I was not aware of the connection between Hollywood and the murders masterminded by that psycho - burn in hell Manson! However, I could not \"dig it\" watching this movie. I think this is like those paintings that intelectual people try to tell you a lot of BS but you can see clearly that it is nonsense but you are afraid of expressing yourself. This movie has good actors on it and that I respect but the movie is really going nowhere.", "It' a great movie": "I was really excited for this one, and it kinda did it's job, but the whole time I was waiting for something bigger to happen, and in the end their stories wasn't fulfilled, althought killings were great.\nPS That dog is beautiful", "Highly disapponted": "You could cut out everything but the last fight scene and it would be a way better movie than it is. The story lacks, well, story. There's no plot. The subplots are pointless (Why was Margot Robbie's character in there?), most of the movie consists of scenes of movies the characters are filming, that, for the most part, lack any conflict whatsoever, the edition is rough, and way too noticeable, and there are too many shots that are just for nostalgia, and add nothing to the already lacking plot. I came in excited for this movie and I feel I wasted two and a half hours of my life. Wow.", "Hurrah for Hollywood !": "Although I had some reservations about the film, the overall film was satisfying and somehow endearing. It reminds one of all the reasons we love the movies and the folklore surrounding them.\nHaving spent the Summer of '68 in LA, it was a glorious trip back in time and the dawning of Aquarius. The hippie movement was everywhere, people hitching rides, pot smoking .......just a great time to be alive.\nIn any case, Tarantino was just the person to make this film. Few directors or writers know and love Hollywood films as he does. This is truly a love letter to Hollywood and the dream factory that once existed.\nBrad Pitt was outstanding and perfectly cast, Leonardo DeCaprio was excellent as well and the two played off each perfectly. The cast in general were sensational, but two people stood out. Margot Robbie, as Sharon Tate, was just sooo endearing, mark my word, she'll walk away with Best Supporting Actress. Also Michael Moh, as Bruce Lee, which fantastic ! His scene with Pitt was my favorite moment in the film.\nMy only reservation was the soundtrack, considering the era and all the songs, few were strikingly familiar to me. Otherwise buckle up !", "Should have been straight to Netflix": "Well the music was good if not exactly accurate for the timeline. To bad the rest of the movie was tiring, pointless and boring till the end. The acting wasn't great and the famous characters that were portrayed were unrecognizable and what's even worse, extremely unlikeable.I understand the term \"literary license\" but sadly this one should have that pulled for screwing up a timeline so badly that it became unrecognizable and made me wonder if I even lived through it. I also wonder what Sergio Leone would have thought of Tarantino using what is basically his Once Upon A Time hook for a move as bad as this? Maybe it's better he didn't live long enough to find out.The only good thing about this movie is the ending and after watching it I couldn't help but wish that art imitated life and the events unfolded exactly as happened.I'm sorry but Tarantino's movie making prowess has definitely been diminishing in the past few years. But on the plus side he does keep alot of his Hollywood friends working.", "Didn't get it": "Unfortunately I just didn't get this movie.\nNo matter how much I wanted to like this latest Tarantino offering, it fell far short of my expectations. I really do believe that at this stage in his career he's living off of his former glory. No plot, no character development, no theme I could make out.", "Terrible film": "Most boring film I have ever seen, nearly walked out it was that bad and I have never walked out of a movie. No plot nothing happening typical Tarantino movie. Someone said it was good for cinematography and 60s retro well this is a film no matter how good visual ares it needs a story even a bad one but this is lacking everything, if people want to reminisce they have the internet for that. I am sorry but this film is bad it's one of those films people think they should like because it's cool to like but it lacks in everything other than having a lot of great actors in. it's empty.

Worst Fiction ever": "When I go to cinema, I go for movies. If I want a documentary i stay home and watch History..", "Trip down memory lane": "This movie brought back so many memories about how television and the movies use to be. Loved that Brad Pitt was a good friend to Dalton's character like friends used to be. When television was new every American girl was looking for her hero on TV. Even movie stars worry about where their next check is coming from. Add to that the suspense of Charles Manson ready to wreak their dirty deed on Polanski and Sharon - creep factor and real-life news freaky memories. Hippies disrespected, how they made current day actors look like, \"Oh, I remember him/her\" actors back then. I can not say enough about Kurt Russell - love everything he's done. Feel sorry for Leo, so caught up in himself and his image, but Brad stays the course and saves the day; with an ending I'm sure we all wish was how it really happened, but wasn't to be. I have to say, this is one of Tarentino's BEST movies.", "Unlike other Quentin's film, but other Quentin's film. It more like a mixtape, all Quentin elements you can find in this.": "Once you heard the name, Quentin, the first thing in your head definitely are those massive violent scenes. Blood splashed everywhere, broken human parts laid on the ground... If you have those expectations, want to watch a classic violent Quentin film, then this may or may not let you down. I have to tell you that this film does have blood splashing and other violent parts, but this film is not about violence.\nAlthough this film is based on the real incident, Tate Murder, but the story of the film is telling you a different story. By the way,!!!DO NOT SEE, READ, OR WATCH ANY SPOILERS!!!This review will have slight spoilers, just a wee little bit, please feel safe to continue your reading.\nQuentin is still that Quentin, as I said above, all his elements you can find in this film. Quentin used two fiction characters show the whole picture of the last century's Hollywood. In this film, you can see two normal Hollywood actors (Well, an actor and a double) set in this golden age background, they try to fight for their future, want to have a new start back into audience's sight. But Hollywood is Hollywood. It never lacks talents. The director used these two \"normal\" guys and the story between them to rebuilt the 1960s Hollywood.\nThe story flow has its own speed, and each chapter connects to each other smoothly. The whole story from beginning to the end, every part of this film seize your attention tightly. But the length of the film could be a challenge for people who not usually watch a film for 3 hours, This film can easily lose him at some point of it.\nOverall, this is a very classic Quentin style film and totally worth to spend your time on it. I can't spoil, so, not much can say, but just go watch it.", "New genre": "This is a gutsy approach by Tarantino, he has molded the storyline to his perspective ,the way he had created two characters rick(DiCaprio)and cliff(brad) to create havoc and DiCaprio would be eye feasting to watch, the roasting of lee, the one liners, the story of tate from an third point view were good, this kind of story requires new genre,but the gore which will be normal on Tarantino's movie is less overall its not the best movie of Tarantino but till it is one of the best....", "Superb and one of his best!": "Left the cinema last night buzzing and been thinking about it all day today. It's been a long time since I felt that way coming out of a cinema. Acting is top notch throughout, especially from the two leads. If your not a fan of non plot moving dialogue, this may not be for you, but for those that do, you really should make the effort to go out and see this. Almost every scene had me hooked and the long run time seemed to just fly by. It was a stark reminder of how much I miss great acting and great dialogue, something sadly lacking in modern cinema. I struggle to make my mind up on my favourite Tarantino movie and I need to see it again to make a true judgement as to whether it is my new no1. At they very least it's up there with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.", "Tarantino made ir agan!": "Great cast and Tarantino made them work together! Love the movie, I will have to watch it again, it is just too good.Brad Pitt + Leonardo", "Fun vs Hatred": "The culture of the 1960s has become an ideology. Images of free living, sexual revolution and colourful drug fuelled adventure blind the masses to the truth of this fractured time. By the end of the decade the counterculture had become corrupted and the hippies were disillusioned with their own quest. It became an exercise in groupthink in which individuality went out the window in place of hatred, destruction and sterility of culture. They all began to dress the same, music began to sound the same, and the status quo that they supposedly despised began to look more appealing than the lack of values the movement now possessed. Tarantino has captured this historical moment and analyzed the different responses to this cultural problem in the form of his excellent characterization. Showcasing the charismatic figure of Charles Manson could have led to a romanticized presentation of hippie lifestyle, one that is already so prevalent in our overly nostalgic culture. Instead, Tarantino opted to show the desperate followers of Manson as impulsive fools caught in a spell of Manson's making that promised them an escape from their failings and depressions. A rag tag bunch of losers with no individuality, resorting to murder on the supposed word of their God. What a moving scene it was when a young girl escaped the corruption of the cult and drove away before the violence, to the anger of the murderous Tex. There is nothing romantic about the hippies in this production, only their nihilistic slovenly ranch lifestyle developed with eerie tension, showcasing the empty shell of their lives which could only have been filled by a manipulative psychopath. The end of the 1960s was the end of the movement for a reason.In conjuring up these bleak images of the counterculture, Tarantino reveals through the main plotline a deep love for the mainstream culture of 1960s Hollywood. Rick Dalton is a character at a crossroads, a character in crisis. He can choose to continue a career as a blind man, not expressing himself as an actor but succumbing to booze, or become the movie star he always wanted to be. His striving for success and dissatisfaction with life puts him at an antithesis with the cult, as he has his passions and problems but uses cinema as an outlet for his pain, cheering at his violent scenes and putting everything he has into his characters. The use of Sharon Tate as an exaggerated version of this philosophy, a carefree girl in love with literature, music, film who never meant to hurt anyone, reinforces the films view that the counterculture had turned evil, and now the only real option was to return to the mainstream.The other option of philosophy Tarantino offers is from the movies hero, Cliff Booth. He is an old fashioned bolt of machismo played by a familiar Hollywood star, showing the hippies and the corrupt no mercy when they disrupt his peaceful stance on life. He is willing to roll with the punches of the time, finding happiness in whatever circumstance he finds himself in. This is the direct antithesis of Manson's crew searching for philosophy at every turn and using it to justify both acts of cruelty and hatred of the world outside of their cult. Cliff instead will love easily and express kindness, while still possessing the ability to fight both for kicks and out of necessity. In short a hero who was able to escape the shallow capitalist values while remaining good at heart. He shows that fulfilling the wishes of the hippies to escape the mainstream materialist culture was possible outside of the path Manson took, in which creating a counter-culture cost his followers their innocence.Tarantino has created a masterpiece, a film with ideals that stand tall against the other throwback movies that reinforce the 1960s as a time of wonder. In the final act of the film, Sharon Tate is spared and the hippies taken down by Rick and Cliff. Ideologies of hatred will always be taken down with force, and after that, peace and innocence can return to our world.", "A masterpiece that only intellectuals who has mastered life will understand the premise/point": "The entire movie was beautifully shot. Classic Tarantino camera angles and slow panning so that you could grasp all the detail of that specific scene. The multiple story lines and characters force you to use critical thinking skills. Pertaining to where they are in their lives respectfully. You have who I'll refer to as an \"aging movie star\" whose confidence has expelled and is completely uncertain of his future in acting and in life. Then you have a stunt double who is the cool guy who doesn't care about the attention but is masterfully trained smooth keen and tactical due to always practicing stunts over his career. The stunt double has always played second fiddle to the movie star so he could care less about what direction his career goes as long as he has work. The stunt doubles development was nominal as was the third character an aspiring female actress. These secondary stories with these two characters were entertaining and hilarious especially the hippie ranch. You should take from Margo robbies character that all she wanted to do was be appreciated for her character and know that she was respected. You should take from Bradd Pitts character that he was always a smooth man who understands life that will continue to go with the flow regardless. You should understand from Leo dicaprios character that Tarentino wanted to get a point across and that was clear for the entire movie . The point is you have to believe in yourself and be confident no matter what. Leo's character sought affirmation the entire movie. He received pitty from the 8 year old girl who boosted his morale as well as the director speaking to him after the scene in the saloon. Those were purely confidence boosters for Leo's character and he took that and ran with it. At the end of the movie Leo's character is so happy to be talking with his neighbors in hopes that them accepting him will some how propel him and his career or at the very least keep his career afloat . Other people's opinion of him propelled him and gave him confidence. The entire movie Leo sought affirmation from outside sources. When sadly that is not how you should gain your confidence. Confidence comes from within confidence is something you tell yourself you have. The last 20 minutes of the move were an accumulation of the first 2 hrs . The plot lined up and that is why the ending makes perfect sense with the hippies and flame thrower. Great movie overall.", "Piece of crap!": "Nothing happens, no story, no development, ridiculous ending...", "One of the most boring, most stupid movies EVER": "I waited sooo long for something to happen, but literally nothing happened.

Also, Tarantino can definitely do better.", "Worst Tarantino's film": "Beautiful photography, costumes, incredible art department, and.... nothing", "Over hyped movie": "I just saw this movie and there is not a story it drags for two hours the acting is decent nothing for a Oscar worthy in my opinion the last 30 minutes of the movie are the best! I don't recommend it to watch it at a movie theater just wait when it comes on Netflix or redbox.", "Indulgent 1969 Hollywood Love Letter...Sort Of": "You'll spend so long looking at painstaking recreations of vintage neon signs in the first 2 hours you may struggle to find the plot threads. Flashback within a flashback might be a bit distracting. Parts may go on a bit long. You'll uncomfortably gaze at the soles of dirty feet thrust right at the camera.Don't hold this against the film. It revels a touch long in the times, but it's never hard to watch. The audience grew restless by the end of the second act, but was won over in the third. The fantasy, what-if ending, whose seeds were planted in the meanderings of the earlier 2 hours, pays out with such violent satisfaction that you will forgive the minorly self-indulgent nature of the film.With all that said? It probably still could have lost 25 minutes and been just as effective.", "Awesome cinematic exprerience but maybe not for everyone": "I myself found the movie absolutely brilliant and was suprised by a lot of the bad reviews..\nThe performences by brad and leo where absolutely outstanding! Brad really was the star of the show! I myself am a big big tarentinp fan so i can understand that this movie is not for everyone.. this all aside, i found this one of tarantinos best. The soundtrack, characters, acting, action where to absolutely die for!\nThe ending was absolutely crazy. Again tarantino changes history with his imagination where you find yourself at the edge of your seat.\nFor tarantino fans a much watch.. but maybe for people who arent used to his films it may come as dissapointing...\nAnyhow, great movie", "A Nostalgic Lullaby for Tarantino Fans and Old White Guys": "While I enjoyed the amazing performances and production value which created a visceral \"texture\" of of 1969 Hollywood, I was ultimately left disappointed by a two major things:1. The introduction of more complex themes - like the transition of Hollywood from \"movie stars\" to \"actors\" - that ultimately went nowhere.2. The revisionist take on history that offers no cathartic value for the characters OR the audience and simply exists to support the old Hollywood idea that old white guys finish first, because \"reasons\".", "A new and fresh masterpiece by QT": "Innovative structure and pacing. Stunning acting and direction. Inmersive, fascinating characters and situations, you wish that it never ends. Climax ending.", "1969 Hollywood Melancholic Brilliance": "Just when you think Tarantino could be running out of gas he comes out with this incredible story based around a real life event. The whole cast works excellent together and seem motivated towards a common goal, resulting in one of the best productions any of the involved parties have worked on.Despite it's duration, the movie doesn't feel slow or boring at all since it flows smoothly. Quentin utilizes several resources out of his playbook to keep the film dynamic, while staying always unpredictable. Towards the end, everything comes together in such a ridiculous way that only Tarantino could portray.Definitely a must watch for movie lovers but also very entertaining for the casual audience. Knowing the history behind Sharon Tate's murder is definitely recommended but not a requirement by any means either.", "A Mediocre Tale": "A movie with so much critical acclaim, left me a bit disappointed after the credits rolled. Don't get me wrong, the movie has a lot of positives. Fantastic style and filmography transport you back in time to Hollywood in the 60s. The attention to detail and outstanding acting performances from the entire cast really made me want to love this film. However, the story told never really seemed to get going. It's a 2+ hour movie that, storywise, takes you nowhere. There's no real objective or payoff. Just aimless scene after aimless scene, some of which don't make much sense on why they were included. The movie succeeds in almost every way, except a compelling story.", "What's the point of this film?": "I have just tried to watch this movie the second time. The first time was on a flight so thought maybe watching it on a bigger TV screen with surround sound might make it better but not to be so gave up half way through.I can't see the point of this film except perhaps some self indulgence by QT.", "Funny, nostalgia-filled, and violent": "To sum up Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, it is funny, nostalgia-filled and violent. The movie transports us to the 1960s Hollywood, where Leonardo di Caprio's Rick Dalton struggles with the changing times and is supported by his stunt double/pal (played by Brad Pitt) Cliff Booth. The color, and vibes is very 1960s, and you could feel the positivity and innocence of that era. This innocence is best embodied by Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate. The movie is filled with fun cameos such as Al Pacino, Kurt Russells, Tarantino regular Zoe Bell. There is also a very captivating performance by Julia Butters as a young Method actress, who manages to go toe-to-toe with the talented di Caprio. The pacing is a bit slow and leisurely, and some scenes could be cut out, but all the performances of the stellar ensemble are in fact stellar (funny that these stellar performances are played by stars playing stars). There are some really tense senses, sprinkled with humor, and a violent conclusion. It is a movie to experience and breeze through. For that quality alone, it is worth a watch. And of course Leo and Brad are excellent!", "Can't wait for the Directors Cut": "In an Instagram world where youth expects instant experience, instant pay off and instant results, this 9th effort from Tarantino is brave in the extreme.How anyone with any modicum of respect for film making, and film makers would regard OUATIH as \"too long\" or with \"too little story\" is beyond me.Tarantino knows what he's doing, believe me.Is it his best work? Hard to say, with only one viewing, but I can see it is certainly a departure in tone to his prior works, and that seems to have upset some, but directors need to evolve and that's what QT is doing here.I couldn't disagree more with the comments on here on the \"disrespectful\" treatment of Tate, quite the opposite; her treatment couldn't be more uplifting for her memory.In the end, this picture is triumph for Pitt in particular, and I think as time passes, for Tarantino too.", "Just Kept Waiting": "It was okay.... If you really like the actors in this movie than sure go ahead and watch it it's not bad. It's just not good either. There isn't really a plot and I just kept waiting and waiting for something to happen and nothing happens Until the last 20 minutes. I felt like Al Pacino was wasted and so was Margot Robbie. So if you don't have anything to watch sure go ahead and watch it but if there is something else you want to watch you should probably watch that.", "Only matters who's in it and who directed it": "The only reason this got made and has any sort of positive reviews is because of who wrote and directed it and who's in it.It's a forgettable movie which doesn't really tell much of a story, with Tarentino desperately trying to fit in a bloody scene at the end.People can try and dissect this movie to make it sound clever and interesting all they want, it's not great, it's dull and probably Tarentino's worst. Which is fine, but let's not try and make out it's good just because it's directed by Tarentino.", "Very good movie..!!!": "I thought this movie was very well researched to get the authenticity to a T. It's no wonder Brad Pitt got an Oscar for his role as Cliff Booth. It was a movie within another movie. Quinten Tarantino did an outstanding job at writing & directing this film. It was so poignant, edgy, intriguing. The acting by all the cast members was wonderful. It's definitely a must see movie for 2020..", "Hollywood 1969": "Leonardo and Brad gives masterful performance together. It's Tarantino's fine decision to bring them together as Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, as well as Margot as Sharon Tate. The movie debuted in Cannes and got 7 minutes of standing ovation.", "3 hours long....": "They did well bringing back all the probs from olden time. The story.... not as interesting as expected. 3 hours movie is definitely way too long for this story.", "RUBBISH": "Just waisted over 2 hours of my time watching this dribble.", "Quentin Tarantino is a Real Genius": "That's one of the best,this isn't the way Quentin Tarantino make his Movies but you can also enjoy that. first 2 Hours of the movie was the way normal and after that in the last 40 minutes knock knock Quentin Tarantino coming in. Brad pitt was wonderful he deserve to won an Oscar for supporting role. the little girl in western movie had marvelous play the dialogs was great and also the Dog you could love that precious creature.", "One of Tarantino's Worst...And it's Still Great": "Tarantino has spent the last 25 years weaving yarns that jump in time, play loose with facts, revel in Hollywood history and never shy away from cartoonish violence. Once Upon a Time... carries all of that, to lesser success than some of his past films. Nonetheless, it's still a visual and comedic blast, one that asks as much from its audience as it offers, and sits among his catalogue comfortably.\nIt's an episodic film, following the varied lives of Hollywood insiders in 1969 navigating the changing landscape of the movie business and American culture with the onslaught of the hippie movement and Charles Manson. DiCaprio plays an aging television star dealing with the existential crisis of being washed-up. Pitt is his stunt-double, a man who never quite fit in the business. Robbie is their neighbor, infamous starlet Sharon Tate. Those three performers are each stellar in their roles, rolling around in their dialogue and settings with the verve and passion of a pig in mud. The film is never afraid to slow down and hang with these characters in their quietest moments, but their individual stories lead to an ending that is among Tarantino's most gloriously insane and irreverently hilarious.\nUltimately this is another Tarantino rewrite of history. However, unlike Django or Inglourious, it's much less black-and-white. Those films are aspirational fantasies, placing the good guys in the winning position, whether true or not. With Once Upon, we're rewriting history with much more complexity than slavery and Nazism; we're creating a history that continues the oppression of the Hollywood studio system, something Tarantino certainly doesn't condone. So what's his point? Not sure, but I'm willing to revisit this highly entertaining histori-fiction over-and-over to find out.", "Classic tarantino": "Simply put, it is a classic Tarantino. Great acting, great story, great twists, great ending, one of the all time greats.", "Nice docudrama of LA in 60s but story lacking": "I like most QT films but this one story wise is really lacking esp for anyone with no knowledge of the true life characters and it dwells excessively on western films in Hollywood which might not appeal to general global public. It's a bit of a surprise to see such a tame non comical story from QT but of course the ending is similar to IBastards so no surprise there. The acting as always was rock solid by everyone and his directing is superb except endless amounts of nostalgia details. Probably total boredom for many not from this era yet kudos for the docu style as you really feel you're back in 1969. At one point 2 hours into it we thought maybe it could be renamed Once upon a day in down n out Western Hollywood. It's not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination yet a nice fair well to Hollywood if QT does retire. Sure hope he ends with this rather than Kill Bill 3.\nBe prepared for a long long film with not much storyline to follow except the ending is comical QT. And Brad/Leo are sensational.\nA solid 7", "Wonder how it have grotten 8 stars??": "Gave it 3 stars. 1 for each hour. No plot, no climax, no nothing. 2 scenes that qualify to the genre comedy. This movie is among the 10 worst ive seen.", "If you grew up in the 60's this movie will grab you!": "Quirky movie that has the typical Quentin Tarantino signature directorial style. Stellar acting by the lead cast keeps you entertained - and the retro music and radio DJ's and commercials provide a pleasant teleportal to those rockin' 60's! We see Leonardo's character on the downside of his acting career, with his trusty sidekick (Brad Pitt) trying to keep his principal's ego on track. Many have panned this film, but I found it entertaining and enjoyable and a decent homage to what Hollywood is (and isn't). Margot Robbie was breathtaking as ingenue Sharon Tate, and though history was altered in the end scenes, that's just QT being QT. \"I changed historical facts because I'm Quentin Tarantino, dammit!\" The scene between Cliff and Bruce Lee was worth it all by itself! Great soundtrack too! Watched it twice.", "Smooth one": "Great cinematography showing the audience the regular life of celebrities in Hollywood, while bringing nostalgic scenes of Tarantino's old movies styles", "Expect something more like The Big Lebowski than Pulp Fiction.": "While it still did generally feel like a Quentin Tarantino movie it wasn't really what I was expecting. At first I felt somewhat underwhelmed by that. It was more slow moving than I was used to with Tarantino and I kept wondering when this fantastic movie everyone was talking about would show up. And with the exception of the fight scene at the end, it never really did. But an hour after leaving the theater I looked back on it again and I realized that maybe this is just a different kind of movie. It's still Tarantino and there are still plenty of callbacks to film history like spaghetti westerns, macaroni combats and Bruce Lee martial arts flicks. No surprise with it being set in Hollywood, of course. But it wasn't overly stylized and was more subtle than usual for Tarantino. In 2016 the Coen brothers released Hail Ceaser which followed one day out of Hollywood life in the '50s. And that's essentially what this film does, only with the '60s. The film basically follows three plot lines and it's a series of segments. Again, something more like The Big Lebowski or Caddyshack or Napoleon Dynamite or the aforementioned Hail Ceaser. So you could say that I liked it more as I thought about it more.", "Way below my expectations": "I like Tarantino movies. My favorite movie ever is kill bill! So my expectations were high for this movie.\nI like Leo di Caprio movies, everything he acts he turns into gold. (So did he this time as well. Perfect acting by Leo.)\nI'm ok with Brad Pitt. (He sometimes acts great but mostly he is in average movies. So this one he got lucky because Leo was in it. Brad Pitt himself also acts pretty awesome in this movie.)\nBut yes there is an overall disappointment because I expected much more from this movie. Imagine me being a top fan of tarantino and Leo. I had high expectations and I'm quite disappointed with the overall story line: I tried liking it, even watched some parts again but I couldn't get myself into liking this movie. Things do not get connected until the very end and it feels it's all over the place. The only thing that makes it watchable is Leo's acting!\nMoreover it's a twist to the truth at the end. People who actually died in real life end up to be alive in the movie. This twisted truth is most probably being named as \"art\". Still I think most people should watch this movie because of the big names involved.", "A Tribute to Hollywood and Tarantino's wit.": "Starting off this review I must say this film is not for everyone, not because it's an \"over the top Tarantino style film\", although I must say this is the least excessive of his films that I've seen. This movie is a comedy, that has a heart and makes you feel for its characters. Tarantino proves that he is the king of dialogue, I was glued to the screen for every second of this movie. Leo gives his best performance that I've seen from him and Pitt is an excellent supporting role as well, the two's chemistry makes you wonder how they've never been in a movie together before. You are fully transported and immersed in the culture of the late 60s and what Hollywood was like then, while seeing the parallels between a successful TV star (Leo) and a successful Movie star (Margot Robbie). Tarantino does this masterfully and has made this movie my favorite of his and my favorite movie of the year (so far). There's a lot to take in with this movie (at a nearly 3 hour run time), and I could break down certain scenes (the last 10 minutes were absolute perfection), but this movie isn't just a masterpiece through its acting and technical aspects, it is just a FUN movie, from start to finish. Although primarily a comedy it covers just about every single genre you can think of, which will have you leaving the theater fully satisfied.

Ebert's standard for genre pictures was that what was important was not what a movie was about but how it was about it. That's good enough for Tarantino's riffs on genre like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill and Hateful Eight, but it doesn't make the cut for his pseudo-historical pictures like Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained, and Once Upon a Time.History is. You can present it, you can interpret it, you can criticize it, but it is childish simply to wish it away in revenge fantasies. Tarantino is an excellent technician, but his historical pictures use his technical skill, imagination and creative freedom for fundamentally silly purposes. His rewriting of history, or of movies about history, as he wishes history had been is as puerile as a middle school boy's imagination. It doesn't even rise to the pathos of Faulkner's 14 year old Southern white boy wishing Pickett's Charge had turned out differently. Tarantino is more on the level of 6 year old Calvin playing \"Tyrannosaurs In F-14s\" while Hobbes looks on in bemusement.Yes, Tarantino beautifully recreates the look and feel of LA at the end of the 60s, but what does he do with it? He saves Sharon Tate. If you're going to hop in the time machine, go back to the late 60s and save someone in California, why not RFK instead? His death was a historical turning point of national and perhaps world importance. Hers, though tragic for her and her husband, was no more than the loss of one more good looking, fairly talented young actress on the Hollywood conveyor belt. Despite the effort of frightened contemporaries like Joan Didion to build it up into an End Of An Era event like the 1527 Sack of Rome, the Tate-Labianca murders were just a minor incident in the history of Hollywood and Los Angeles. But then, Tarantino sees the world only through the prism of Hollywood.", "One of the most stylish films of all time\u00f0\u0178\u2122\u0152": "If your looking for a film where you can kick back, relax, and enjoy the style, this is the ideal film to turn to. The atmosphere and aesthetic of this movie are glamorous. Highly recommend watching atleast once in a lifetime!", "Finally A Solid Tarantino": "Not the worst movie Tarantino ever made. That \"honor\" goes to either The Hateful Eight or Death Proof.Thankfully, it's not as self-indulgent and boring as either of those. This is a pretty average and mildly amusing What-if scenario.What if the Manson Family group picked the wrong house? It's an interesting thought, if you're a teenager or in your 20s entertaining your fantasy. Not something you'd expect from a filmmaker pushing 60. Tarantino's humor is, unfortunately, still juvenile and he hasn't grown much since Kill Bill. Although I did chuckle here and there. Performances are great across the board and I wouldn't expect any less from such a cast.As for where it ranks? It's his best movie since the first Kill Bill.", "Fantastic Character Sketch": "I was thoroughly entertained by every scene of this lengthy film! Tarantino's genius lies in his skill at building the complexities of his characters within the context of a fantastical, pulpy plot. And, DiCaprio and Pitt use their exceptional acting skills to bring those characters to life. It's a joy to watch them on screen sinking themselves into Tarantino's indulgent screenplay.Case in point--I noticed many of the little ticks and personal details that the actors put into their roles, such as the stammer DiCaprio assigns to Rick or the relationship Cliff has with his dog. You feel like you know these characters so well by the end of the story, and you root for them. Honestly, this is some of the best work DiCaprio and Pitt have done in years.I just love how Tarantino makes no excuses for shaping his own version of history in his films--as he did in Inglorious Basterds. He gives us an ending that we all long for to be truth. I mean, if we had the chance to change the course of events, wouldn't we want to see Manson's minions taken down in extravagant fashion? So satisfying in the director's outrageous style.", "Tarantino is overrated": "Love the acting by Leonardo. But I don't get the hype. Sure, some scenes are very good, but it is like a montage of scenes. Some of the character's are very briefly introduced. It is like, we will fix that in post production, but they don't. Quentin usually mixes his own fantasies with violience. And in this movie it is also a tribute to hollywood and some nerdy film references that fly over most peoples heads. Shallow and no meaningful story with a lack of depth. The film is only written and viewed in the perspective of a man. Even though the story evolves around Sharon she is like a side note. Minimizing her to a blonde dumb actress. Quentin fails to tell her story and who she really was. The fate of Sharon Tate (yes it rhymes) and her friends deserves more than this film tried to. I get that it was a different story but it feels like the film failed to mix the reality and filmworld in a good or honorful way.", "Even the actors couldn't save this complete bore of a movie": "Never got interested in any of the characters due to bad writing. Over 2.5 hours of dribble and time I can never get back. I love the actors but they were handed a bad script and as usual Tarantino fell in love with himself. Too much nonsensical dialogue, over the top violence in order to shock the audience. He has made a couple of good films but has also made some that deserve to win a rasberry award such as this one for writing. The 30 minutes at the end dedicated to the Manson Family was so ridiculous and for me summarized the whole flm. Total garbage! I did enjoy the music, wardrobe and seeing some of history of the late 60's and the culture. Save your money!", "It's a Slice of Life Fairy Tale About Hollywood in Crisis": "This movie is possibly one of the most endearing films I have ever seen. It takes you away from your surroundings, and puts you into the world of these characters like no movie has ever done before. It feels more accurate than reality tv at its most real. It a slice of life, and it was something that creates real emotion, while mixing action, with suspense, with a lot of really well timed comedy. It also has one if the best endings to a movie I have seen in a long time. It also goes along with the \"Once Upon a Time...\" narrative, being a fairy tale. Quentin wrote a positive ending instead of putting the real ending which would have been far more tragic. It is a masterclass in story telling, and leaves you thinking about a world where the 60's never ended. It's not for everybody, but if you want to leave your world for 3 glorious hours, there is no better place to do so.", "40 min in The movie": "Holy S...\nWhat is that for a movie. ?

What's The Point??": "If you have appreciated a couple of Quentin Tarantino's former films, you may be disappointed with this one. There is very little plot to speak of, and there are long drawn-out scenes that don't add anything to a storyline, such as watching Brad Pitt drive for several minutes. That's it, just driving. The movie is so scattered, random, and slow. The movie then completely veers off into a tale of Charles Manson, the commune, and Sharon Tate, which I found completely unnerving, disgusting, completely tasteless, and utterly disrespectful to those who are slaughtered in that insane situation, only to be parodied in Tarantino's shameful offering to the Industries consumers. It really makes me wonder how this piece of work received such high ratings. It must have taken a lot of promises and a lot of cash.", "Don't waste your time on this crap": "I don't care what are the names of the actor or director of a movie .. I care more about what it provides .. this movie burned more than 2 hour of my time .. and wasted my money as well.One star for the actors performing which was good and the other star for the nice decoration and the Using right details to mimic those old days .. other than that, this movie should get an oscar for the most boring experience ever. I thought of it many times, I wanted to go out from the cinema during this boring movie, but i stayed just because I was enjoying the Popcorn.", "Gift for fans": "Finally, I saw a Quentin who completely rebelled against Hollywood in terms of emotional composition. Why does Pete climb to the roof with a record and Bruce Lee's flashback? Why does Xiao Li want to insert part B in the process of chatting with the protagonist? Is Tate going to the cinema to see his films just to show his legs? When Peter really found out that living George was lying in bed, did the so-called crisis narrative and suspense collapse? It seems to be a hodgepodge of b-piece bridge sections, but Quentin deliberately twisted the chain of continuous action response to break. The film is not mediocre because the audience's expectation of psychological failure. Instead, it rises up a cross flash of light formed by disorderly patchwork of broken glass. The last 30 minutes is actually a bad comment on it. From the very beginning, it is a wonderful recollection of the atmosphere of the times. To portray Polanski and Bruce Lee as peerless fools is a wonderful embellishment of the secular fame and wealth market in which the American dream erupted: everything is just the best-selling goods in the vulgar and gorgeous dreamlike bazaar, while Quentin portrays the flashy human flesh market with gentle and sentimental comic strokes.", "Not worth a single penny": "My rating 1/10 is obviously way too much.\nNever seen such a bad movie.\nSRSLY I don't understand how can such an actors be in this kind of movie.\nI literally cant understand how it can have such a good rating.\nMe and my girlfriend left movie about 2 hours 15 minutes after it started, some people left like 1 hour before.

The movie is amazing. Cinematography - Beautiful, Music - Perfect, Acting - Amazing. This movie put me back into an incredible time in Hollywood, made me care about two three characters, made me fear something terrible that I knew would happen, and then gave me an alternative history that I so prefer to reality. Tarantino is amazing.", "Dumbfounded by all the great reviews": "I watch a ton of films and love many edgy, cerebral, experimental explorations. This film, on the other hand, is 2 hours of people driving around in cars with no direction. The story has no direction. The story has no point.Despite my displeasure with the direction or lack of direction, the acting is superb. As it should be. DiCaprio and Pitt are amazing but they seem to be acting in a story that isn't really a story. There is no start middle and end. It's one of the stupidest films I have ever seen.", "Amazed at what is considered an Oscar-worthy film": "This film is boring and clearly overrated. There's nothing more to say.", "Am I missing something?": "3 hours I will never get back. I found it so boring was looking for excuses to stay in the cinema the whole time.", "A fun ride, punctuated by moments of strong tension and both melancholic or joyful instants. For a purely jubilatory finale, in absolute apotheosis !": "A colorful tale (like the Sixties) with delightful dialogs, which depicts (through more or less long sequences, funny or melancholic) both the pleasure and the spleen to be an active member of the 60s' Hollywood. The other side of the story, between legit historical facts and miscellaneous events, or other purely fun situations (sometimes especially for us the audience).I know that a lot of people felt that they did not really understand where all this fuss could lead ... But from the beginning to the end, the core theme stays \"how to find one's place and a sense of life, in this Hollywood as well as in that era, both of which are undergoing a real mutation, and a bit like what had been shown in a touching way in \"The Artist\", \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" also takes a rather touching look on this human need to be loved and not to end up to pasture (or worse). So it remains very spirited and also not too delusional, but not only that ! Quentin Tarantino's very tasty ingredients (with the codes and references that are so dear to his heart, as well as a stylish cinematography, effective as always). So it ends in absolute apotheosis, especially for any fan who digs these juicy dishes of which Tarantino holds the secret.The three lead roles are obviously excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor trying to find the light back & himself in the process, Brad Pitt as badass good pal with a heavy past, and Margot Robbie who embodies the sheer freshness of the Hollywood Dream.I find that this film can be considered among Tarantino's best movies (the main actors as the second roles besides, enhance every little scene). The numerous jubilant dialogues & scenes. And some quite memorable scenes here and there (as in all self-respecting Tarantino). In short, a good combo in my eyes. But depending on whether you're a fan of what Tarantino movies you prefer, I can understand that this film does not necessarily meet certain expectations. Moreover, I think that the film has some solid arguments, because it is strewn with many moments, in their respective genres, that have a real potential to become cults (but of course : different people, different strokes).", "An insult to Sergio leone": "I really wanted to enjoy this despite never liking any QT films in the past , I wanted to give it a chance - nearly three hours later I feel robbed , robbed of my time , my money ( although it didn't cost the extortionate \u00c2\u00a312.75 as I have an unlimited card ) and my intellect.From start to finish the film plus trailers lasted 3 hours - 2 hours of tedium sitting around 4/10 and then in the finale it drops to 1/10 .If you're going to add historical characters and occurrences then at least have the dignity to stick to them .The final scenes were far too violent and and then took on the genre of a zombie movie which seemed to get the audience laughing and I'm not sure if that was the intention .Margot Robbie was wasted as Sharon Tate , she never really had a chance to act - Leonardo acted his heart out as always and Brad's contribution was eerie . But what let this down was the script . It was plotless and it when it finally got the the final scene it was ruined by deviating so far from reality .There were some impressive factors however but the bad bits overwhelmed the good parts . The recreation of the 1960s was impressive although seeing Pan Am 747's flying in 1969 was either a purposeful error or all part of the Hollywood 'fairytale' playing with history - since it didn't enter service till 1970.Overall it a poor movie and plays little homage the the brilliant Once upon a time in the west . It's undeserving of the title .This is certainly not a classic , ironically this is the first QT film without Weinstein backing but it's still taken over $100m in its opening weekend making it one of the most successful films of 2019 so far - it had plenty of 10/10 reviews so the QT fans are happy so if you like Reservoir dogs , Pulp fiction and the like you'll probably like this too . I didn't on both counts .Pad.A 1/10", "Best Movie I've seen in a long time!": "So refreshing to watch a movie like this these days... Tarantino absolutely nailed it!", "good but missing something": "The violence seemed plug-n-play. Plonked as token formula trademark.Good tension and atmosphere, but sometimes scenes end up in vague destinations.Is Hollywood behind the scenes that fascinating? I suppose but I couldn't find myself caring.One stand-out was the girl (Julia Butters) and her conversation scene with DiCaprio. The clever and funny lines nicely written, her execution icing on cake. DiCaprio was good to watch in this role.I enjoyed the old cars, the cinematics, the editing and tension, but everything felt stuck in second gear.Expectations not met on this occasion. Still gets a reasonable 6 or 7 out of 10 for good entertainment with a short rubber-stamped concentrated dose of blood splattering violence. It was missing something.", "Literal hot garbage": "Anyone giving this movie a positive review is clearly a bot.Nothing happens. Like, at all.

The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt was spot on. The cinematography, perfect. This film totally captivated me in its entire 3 hours. I will say though, I didn't really understand the movie, like, I get the storyline, but it felt quite fragmented and overall the first 2 hours and last hour felt more like a part 1 and part 2 rather than a single movie. I don't know how, but this movie just attracts you but at the end of the day, you don't really know what you just saw.", "disappointing from the word GO": "It's one of those movies you keep waiting to get better, but it never does, and you're angry you wasted your time. I imagine this is DRIVEL birthed out by Hollywood to support actors in a crappy economy. The plot is the weakest I have ever seen. Horror movies have more plot.It teases of a twisted crime that happened in Hollywood ages ago, but doesn't deliver the tiniest tidbit. It is like they baited you to watch this movie, like BAIT AND SWITCH. LOOK here are some top notch stars! Oh NO! it's one of the most terrible movies you have ever seen. I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie even if I was blasted! Its that poor!", "WHAT WAS THE POINT?": "I love QT films but this was soo boring, was waiting for the movie to start after 90 minutes, this can have 2 stars because the end scene was good, that's about it.What was the point in this film? There was hardly a story line, what was the point in Margot Robbie's character? The whole film was an anti-climax.All that needs to be said, if this wasn't directed by QT, this would no-where near get the hype it has done, it would be classed as awful, simple as that.", "Tarantino transports us back to 1969 in a lovingly made tribute to a Hollywood that no longer exists": "Quentin Tarantino returns to write and direct his ninth film, this time taking us back to Hollywood in the year 1969. This is a movie that I have been curious about for quite some time now, ever since the first trailer came out. After finally going to see it, I can definitely say it did not disappoint.The film follows the paths of a fading television star, Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Dalton is struggling to remain relevant in this new Hollywood that he can hardly even recognize. Now, if you're looking for an intricate, fast-moving plot, this is most certainly not the movie for you. As Tarantino has stated, this film is almost more of a day-in-the-life of these characters, meaning there really is no specific plot that you can point to. Instead, Tarantino uses this movie as an opportunity to completely transport the audience back in time to this unique and fascinating time period. I guess you could say there is no real story at all. I'm sure you know, however, that a key event this film contains is the infamous murder of Sharon Tate and her friends. This event is kind of used as a way of letting us know where this is all going. We know what the film is leading up to, we know where this will end, and Tarantino uses this as a way of pulling the story together and connecting everything. However, just to ensure that there is no confusion here: this movie is not about the murders. The film follows Rick and Cliff as they make their way through 1969 Hollywood; as many have stated, it is a love letter to this time period and the Hollywood that no longer exists more than anything else. Many have wrongly assumed that this is a movie strictly about the murders, and I can assure you, this is not true at all.Now, of course, the night of the murders does eventually arrive. Tarantino once again provides his own little twist on history. Sharon Tate and her friends survive the night. In fact, the killers never even end up in her house. Instead, they end up in the house of Rick Dalton, and in a few gruesome minutes, Rick, Cliff, and Cliff's dog brutally take out all three of the would-be murderers. The reasoning behind the killers being in Rick's house in the first place is ridiculous. However, I still loved the ending. Tarantino takes his time with Manson's followers before the final scene, building up an intense hatred that the audience feels for the killers by the time they enter Rick's house. This allows for an incredibly satisfying and almost comical scene, despite the brutal violence on display. All of the built-up tension is finally released as this fight breaks out. This is not an ending that will please everyone. I, however, found it to be a satisfying and entertaining ending to the film.For a Tarantino movie, this film is decidedly light on the violence. He is able to restrain himself almost entirely until the last 10 minutes or so, when his classic over-the-top style of violence kicks in. That's when it gets so ridiculously excessive that you almost have to just laugh; for the most part, it seems that it actually is meant to be played for laughs. Despite the lack of the usual Tarantino violence outside these 10 minutes, I still found it to be quite an enjoyable film, if slightly less entertaining.This is a film that does move very slow at times. At 161 minutes, you have to be really into the characters and setting for it to not get boring. Fortunately, that was the case for me. I was completely immersed in the story of these two characters, and because of that, I had a good time with the slower pace. Again, this is kind of a day-in-the-life of these two Hollywood actors, and I really had an appreciation for this style of telling a story. If you're not up for that type of thing, this is simply not the movie for you.Despite the limited violence and slower pace, I still think there is a good amount of entertainment value within this film. There is plenty of humor throughout the film, and it ends up being an overall pretty funny movie. This keeps the film from getting boring and provides for a more lighthearted atmosphere throughout the movie. Of course, when addressing things surrounding Manson and his followers, the mood becomes more fittingly dark, but most of the movie has an almost playful feel to it, and it's just fun to watch.The thing Tarantino was most focused on in this movie was providing an accurate recreation of 1969 Hollywood, and he really goes all out in making it feel as authentic as possible. He makes you feel as if you are truly watching events from 1969. He has many long car rides throughout the movie where it just shows the characters driving through Hollywood, with the radio blasting 60s music and the wind blowing through their hair. These were cool scenes that added to the authentic feel of the film, but there may have been one or two too many of these scenes, as it started to get a little excessive at points. You kind of get the sense that there was no one attempting to restrain Tarantino, no one that would simply tell him \"no.\" I feel like this film could have been even better if there were more people attempting to restrain Tarantino a bit. His direction of this movie was still fantastic, but he may have been a bit too self-indulgent at times.Adding to the authentic 1969 feel of the film was the outstanding cinematography. The way everything is filmed, you feel like you're there, like you're back at this time in history that is now long gone. Like I talked about, the car scenes, though perhaps a bit excessive, were some of the best looks we got at this completely different world. The transformation of Hollywood Boulevard was incredible as well, and just the overall production design made everything feel 100% authentic. Transporting the audience back in time was most definitely the film's greatest feat.With Rick Dalton, Tarantino crafted an interesting, if not entirely likable, character. Rick feels incredibly sorry for himself all the time, but we, as the audience, do not necessarily sympathize with him, as he does not prove to be the kindest of people; in fact, he seems to be a bit of a self-centered jerk who cares about pretty much no one but himself. He does, however, seem to be of some joke that goes throughout the whole film. He smokes cigarette after cigarette, despite the obvious damage to his lungs. He becomes a raging alcoholic with random emotional outbursts for no discernible reason. There isn't much at all to be liked about his character, and I think that was intended. I think this was, however, a very well-written character that was enjoyable to watch, even if we don't have any strong emotional connection with him.As for Cliff Booth, he is a character that the audience does connect with and care for. When he arrives on Spahn Ranch, he does indeed go out of his way - potentially putting himself in great danger - to make sure that an old man that lives at the ranch is ok, and not being taken advantage of. This for me showed that he was a caring and thoughtful person, and made him a far more likable character for me. Anyway, Cliff is the stunt double and partner of Rick, and does everything both with him and for him. He doesn't ask for anything in return, and certainly doesn't get anything in return, but he doesn't seem to care one bit. He is overall just super laid back and attempting to enjoy life in the ways that he can. In this way also, he is a very likable character. Overall, besides the one seemingly out-of-place element of Cliff supposedly killing his wife (couldn't tell if that was real), he is a very likable character, and it is great to see him (and his dog) as the heroes of the movie when we reach the end.Now, as for Sharon Tate, the fact that she is in this film at all is very controversial. However, I thought her portrayal on-screen was managed very well, and the audience sees her in a positive light for the person she was rather than the horrific ending to her life. Her character in this story represents hope and potential for a great future, and I think that is a great way to honor who she was.Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton is great as always. His role was a particularly difficult one because he was essentially playing two characters. He was playing Rick the person, but also playing Rick when he was acting in a movie. Of course, he can't just act the same way that he himself acts, he has to act the way Rick would act. This is an incredibly complex and challenging task that most actors would not be able to pull off, but DiCaprio does it nearly flawlessly. As Rick himself, he is totally believable in every way, and has some truly great scenes where he really gets into that character.Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth is charming, likable, and funny. He totally pulls off the performance in all the best ways. The thing he really does well with is the humor. So many of the jokes in this film come from Cliff, and Pitt is really what makes so many of them land effectively. Pitt and DiCaprio both absolutely nail their roles in this film, helping it succeed in a big way.Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate was also excellent. It's always a delicate situation when you have to portray a real-life person, but Robbie handled it very well and was able to succeed at playing Sharon probably better then anyone else could have. She brought a likable, fun-loving personality to the movie that was enjoyed by everyone.I have to say, overall this film had an incredible cast, and everyone else also did very well. Truly great work from everyone that appeared on-screen.Overall, Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is a very good film from Quentin Tarantino, who pulls it off again. It's sure to get several nominations come award season and maybe even win a few. The incredible acting and great directing and cinematography successfully transport the audience back to 1969 in a very enjoyable film.", "Once Upon in Hollywood is a movie that is complete \"trash.\"": "Once Upon in Hollywood is a movie that is complete \"trash.\" First of all, Quentin Tarantino has a very \"limited vocabulary,\" due to the fact that the movie is loaded with \"foul language.\" The story is \"very hard\" to follow.

Margot Robbie is charming as Sharon Tate, Lena Dunham scary as a Manson family member, while young Julia Butters could teach Margaret O'Brien a lesson in precocity.(SPOILER COMING: As in 'Inglorious Basterds' Tarantino concludes the film by rewriting history, to gory but very satisfactory effect.)", "Visual masterpiece": "Everything looks and sounds amazing, the film, the music, the acting. It's really the magic of cinema.", "The Good The Bad The Ugly": "Where to start? Well, how do you tell QT to cut it down, make it short, EDIT!Can you teach the guy to have some respect for his peers & betters. Sharon Tate was elegant & smart. Margot Robbie plays her like a boobie. Maybe it's Margot's shortcoming. Then why hire her? Why bore us with the silly catty 3rd grade depiction of Sharon going to watch herself at a daytime mostly empty movie house & caring about the audience reaction.Why have Damian Lewis, an otw talented Brit but a distinct introvert portray Steve McQueen as a goon. With very bad hair, I might add. I knew McQueen & if there were 2 outstanding characteristics about the guy, it was that he had a tremendous amount of poise & confidence in person & he really took care of his hair. There was a reason he became a major star.I could go on. And on. But it ain't worth it. The ending really cuts this film off at the knees. Whatever redemptive qualities it had rapidly disappear when Tex Watson & crew drive up Cielo drive.QT: you are neither a good film historian nor a decent filmmaker, sorry.", "The only truthful reviews here are the bad ones": "1 wasted 2 hours of my life watching this film, and a further 20 minutes reading the reviews ! The back lots of the Manson ranch were used in the Netflix series Absentia, how dull a film this was, watching a buddy film of Pitt driving DiCaprio around , boring as hell", "I mean... was there any possible scenario where this film isn't good? C'mon": "I really believe that what most reviewers out there are saying about this movie is accurrate, even within Tarantino's films, this movie is definitely one of the less \"standard audience friendly\", I get that most regular moviegoers would say it's \"boring\" or something like that. However, if you appreaciate cinema just a bit more, I can't see a way you wouldn't like this movie.For me, just the fact that we have Pitt and DiCaprio working together for the first time would be by itself a reason to watch this movie in loop for 10 hours. As you would expect they are ridicously awesome, and every scene is delightful to watch. Thanks, Tarantino, really.Margot Robbie doesn't have as much screen time as I thought she would had, but she is awesome as Sharon Tate.I mean, there isn't much else to say, it might not be Tarantino's best movie (Pulp Fiction is still my favorite), but Pitt and Leo are awesome to see, the story is well written (as you would expect), and man... the third act, holy cow, I love what he did with the whole Manson thing, and I thought it was some what beautiful, the fact that in his version of the story, Tate is still alive, and those jerks were destroyed by Brad Pitt and his awesome pitbull. I thought it was really sweet (in a weird way), and gives you a bittersweet taste at the end, thinking about what really happened, and also thinking about the movie.Anyways, to sum up, Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood is a great film, that movie lovers will watch and be amaze by it. The description \"it's a love letter to film\" is 110% accurate, and I wouldn't change a thing about it.Second viewing note: After seen the movie again, really my only issues with it is that the ranch scene seems like it goes on for more that it should go, and kind of drags a bit. And the heavy narration that starts at the last 40 minutes of the movie is at least... different. Overall, I changed the grade from a 8,5 to a 9. I love every second that Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio are on the screen together. What a duo.", "The fading actor and the stuntman": "I watched this film yesterday. Kinda I didn't go to the cinemas to watch it. Way too long, for it's genre. I'm not a Tarantino fan, but neither a hater. The film started of quite interesting, loved how spot on the 60s was made into the movie. Felt really real and accurate. But for me it was a little to boring, it lacked something. It was like we were following the stuntman and the actors everyday life, which I usually am all for. But the humor wasn't that great. Pitt and DiCaprio acted great as always. Margot as Tate was okay, good acting but didn't really have that big of a role. I think she fitted the role in some ways, the found a classy young actress to portrait Sharon Tate, but when it comes down to looks and resemblance they don't even come close. Both beautiful, but totally different looks. Which annoyed me quite a bit. I could never see her as Tate. Anyways, the plot of the movie was very mediocre.. the film could easily have been two hours instead of the 45 minutes extra. I was pretty much waiting to see how everything was going to unfold. And yes the last hour is extremely violent and graphic. And a lot of things happened during the end of the film. I just found the focus on the stuntman and the fading actor to be very boring. Just because you put together a Hollywood A list of actors and filmmakers it doesn't necessarily mean the outcome of the movie will be that great. I have some mixed feelings about the movie. I'm not sure what I expected but as I said I liked the beginning, but not quite pleased with all the slow scenes and the phase of it.To sum it up, not very good but not bad either. Great acting, some funny scenes. But it lacked something.", "If it wasn't Tarantino": "Tarantino is like modern art or freeform jazz, we say we like it because we're afraid to be thought 'uncool' if we don't. Had this movie been directed by John Smith it would have hardly been noticed but because QT can get A-listers and has a name it gets him a pass on what is a much too long, much too meandering movie. This story could have been told in 90 minutes instead of the 160 it took. Brad Pitt does a terrific job, Margot Robbie is perfect and even though strained, Leonardo DiCaprio is very good. The problem is that Tarantino wanders away from what was a great idea into some self indulgent fantasy land. There is a great story in this movie, unfortunately it is being told like your stuttering uncle trying to tell a long joke.", "Not a movie for everyone": "I thanks it is an amazing movie, but its not for everyone.", "This movie is terrific!": "Excellent! An intelligent movie! Terrific acting by all. Trust me.", "Worst movie I have seen in my entire life": "I have never written an IMDB review in my life- I never have been bothered. But this movie left me in such a bad mood, making me feel robbed of both my time and money, that I had to write here. Now let me explain, this movie featured excellent actors and a more than capable director. Thus, the acting and directing of the film was excellent. However, the script was absolute garbage. There was genuinely no story, no climax. It was the equivalent of watching people exist for 2+ hours. I felt as though I was stuck on a flight that was delayed as we were in the air and I was staring at the clock hoping to land. So if you were hoping to be entertained in any way- pick another movie. However, if you are hoping to see something that uses nostalgia as it's only mean of appeal, and by no means provide you with a storyline, then this movie may be for you.All in all, I wish I got my money back for this pathetic excuse of a film.", "And those 3 stars are for the acting, not the movie.": "Why is this steaming pile of boredom getting such good reviews? It's like Tarantino directed Seinfeld, it's a movie about NOTHING. There is zero connection to any of the characters, the portrayal of Bruce Lee is insulting, and the end, well......don't bother sticking around for it because it's a waste.", "Worst Tarantino movie by a mile (if you can call it that)": "Slow. Boring. Plotless. Awful soundtrack and a silly ending - all uncharacteristic for a Tarantino movie. I was expecting a dark kick on the Manson murders, as the trailer implies and the film kind of bubbles up to. Unfortunately, this plodding mess just put me to sleep and the climax I was expecting never materialised. Instead, the conclusion is nonsensical and demonstrates Mr T is finished- all out of fresh ideas. A waste of a good cast, Di Caprio and Pitt are a pleasure to behold, shame Tarantino let them down. I'm still wondering what the purpose of this movie was - to refer to it as a B movie would be a compliment. Save your money- don't get suckered into the 'it's a Tarantino movie' or the fine cast.", "loving ode to Hollywood of yesteryear": "Just seen QT's latest.I enjoyed every minute of it. Hollywood lates sixties, is pure eye candy. The soundtrack is awesome en the acting second tot none.I must say I love all QT's work. This picture in my opinion, isn't his best, maybe not even top three.\nWhat it is, is a well crafted peace of work from the master. It's funny, there's not much action, decent dialogues, but the setting and the entire feel of the movie is great.If you're not familiar with Tarantino's work, you might not want to see it a second time.I love to see it again.", "The ending. Wow": "Spoilers.All I'll say is when I figured out that the ending was retelling the Manson murders I was in awe at the film. Classic Tarantino ending with blood and gore and I absolutely loved it.Also massively enjoyed the 60s style vibe throughout.\nMy one comment would be that this is a bit more of a thinker than the Hateful Eight for example. The ending might not mean as much to you also if you dont know about Charles Manson (Yes I know we have the same surname).Tarantino films are different, you watch, because of the director. We all know his style. I was sat behind someone in the cinema who complained throughout and clearly never heard of Tarantino. And I think that showed the difference between the people that know and love him and people that have no idea and came to watch a modern day \"simple\" film.So if you know about his style, enjoy his style and know about Charles Manson then this is a must watch. 8/10 for me, just as my arse got a bit numb sitting there for almost 3 hours. I also would have enjoyed maybe a little longer on Sharon Tate, but these take nothing away from this film!", "If you skip the first 2hrs, the movie is GREAT!": "The last half hour is absolutely great, classic Tarantino. The first 2 hours are boring and pointless with no plot. Unless you want to see a parody of the 60s, do yourself a favor and skip to the end.", "Suuuuuccccccckkkkkkeeed!": "I can never get those 3 hours back. It was horrible. I have only left one movie ever - I watched this to the end hoping for redemption. Don't do it!", "WOW!!!!": "My first Tarantino movie and it was amazing!

I don't identify as a Tarantino fan, although I have enjoyed some of his films. I have been looking forward to this film and I was not disappointed!\nI was 14 years old in 1969 and I remember the events of August 1969 like it was yesterday. For me, this film took me back to re-experience the music, the actors, the movies and the tv shows of 1969.\nGreat performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt! Some reviewers have said that they saw little depth to the characters but I disagree; we were different back then and you can't view these characters through modern eyes. You need to have a sense of how we have changed as a society over the past 50 years.\nThere are so many wonderful cameos in this film. As I looked over the cast, I realized that I need to watch this film again to catch some that I missed.\nBecause I am fairly well read on the Manson Family, I found myself holding my breath at points in anticipation of disaster, awaiting tragedy.\nAt 2 hours 39 minutes this is a long film but the time flew for me as I was awash in memories of that time. Give this film a try!", "Homage to 1960's counter-culture film industry, and a lot of feet!": "This film is a homage to the past, to the junction when the old school film world was in flux, and the counter-culture film world was taking hold. Drugs, hippies and short skirts were usurping cowboys and injuns, and Quentin Tarantino is in love with the era that followed on from this.This film is undeniably brilliantly put together. The settings are great, and the actors are all perfectly suited to their roles and you can't help but fall in love with that world. This film is like a time capsule of Hollywood in a brief moment.Brad Pitt & Leo DiCaprio are wonderful as the leads, and we watch their journey in this world. In many ways, the underlying allegory is that this transition is a forewarning to all in the industry now, and the parallels are there for all to see.The problem for me is though that it's just too overlong and easily could have been sharply cut down. There were so many scenes that just dragged on, and some totally unnecessary. The Bruce Lee scene could have been cut, and actually has created some controversy which is best left for another time.Also there is Tarantino's foot fetish, and this film goes overboard on it. There's lots of references to some of Tarantino's old film collection, and really this film is a homage to his world as much as to all else.There's good moments, but a leaner film I think could have been better. Admittedly, I'm not a big Tarantino fan, and those who are will lap this up. There's lot to commend it for, and I did love the last half hour, but I can't see myself watching it again. Each to their own.", "Comfortable simplicity and a nice feel": "Comfortable simplicity and a nice feel, although the plot is not highly clear or bolded.The presence of prominent personalities may have had a great effect in attracting viewers using Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio , but the performance was more than wonderful. Cinematography played an important role, especially with long shots and the use of cranes, as well as coloring in post-production which is typically clear print of Quentin Tarantino.In any case I advise strongly to watch this movie and get into a unique mode.We miss such films and such feelings, was a great choice and really great production.", "Best movie of year": "I was the best movie that i ever seen, i like the acting of Leo and brad pit and also Al Pachino was the best , this movie must the movie of the year.", "Do not watch this movie for its story...": "I have always had a love or hate relationship with Tarantino's movies. For Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood it is the most interesting film that I have watched of his filmography. It might not be his best but there is something about this movie that I felt drawn into its characters. From a plot point there is nothing to go for in here but all the characters especially the leading ones are so compelling and interesting that you will feel invested in them to see where they lead to.All the performances in this movie are top notch but it is difficult not to pinpoint both DiCaprio and Pitt who are excellent in their roles and surely will receive some sort of recognition come the awards season. Being a Tarantino movie, there is so much style and visually this movie is impeccably well shot. The camera movement is really well done that I was even noticing certain minor details how it was moving along.As I said in the heading, if you want to go see this movie do not watch it for the story because you will most probably not like it. Even though these characters are based on the truth, never view it from that point of angle. This is a love letter to Hollywood and the art behind. If you really appreciate the art of what goes on behind Hollywood, you will enjoy it as it is. For me it is one of the most interesting movies I have seen for a while.", "I think it was a bit overrated.": "Don't get me wrong the movie was fine but it had some elements that were clearly misses, e.g. various characters were cartoonish caricatures, leo was again mediocre and a bit annoying, it was a bit inconsistent by having tone swings between seriousness and silliness, and it felt like it wasn't a fully complete story, probably because it was trying to base it on real events and that probably limited its room to grow. In overall I'd say it deserves a 7/10 at most.", "As much as I've enjoyed the cinema": "A brilliant series of stories with a super satisfying third act", "No headline": "I have to admit iam NOT a Tarantino fan, i took my girlfriend to see this as she is a fan.\nLeo and Brad Pitt are hilarious..........but one of the worse films i have ever seen, many people laughing when the end credits started because they couldn't believe that was the end.\nI should have done more research, as i remember hearing Tarantino was doing a film about Sharon Tate and Charles Manson, i thought it might be pretty good.......I was wrong!!\nApparently if you are a die hard Tarantino fan it is an amazing movie!", "Eh?": "Not sure where all the positive reviews are coming from? It's no Pulp Fiction by any stretch of the imagination - in fact is unlike any previous Tarantino film. It's a stand-alone disconnected, boring in lots of places and seemingly pointless movie. In one scene we have to watch brad Pitt drive all the way back to his house...a full 5 minutes of watching someone drive. Then there are numerous other scenes that do the same and you're sat thinking what's the point of these scenes. Then there's additional meaningless oddness in Margot Robbie watching the real Sharon Tate star in her own film in the cinema in the film. In fact what was the point in Margot Robbie even in this film? It leads to nowhere. You see Manson in about a 5 second part and that's it. There are about 3 worthwhile scenes in the film but they are wildly separated and the end scene whilst funny is ludicrous and not related to real life. I think Tarantino lost the plot here. Genuinely disappointed as Tarantino is usually superb.", "Superb": "A nostalgic movie about an aging TV cowboy, Rick, and his best friend/stunt man, Cliff, in 1969 Los Angeles. who also interact with both the Manson Family and Sharon Tate. I have always been fascinated with 60s California so this was right up my alley. Tarantino nailed the feel of the period with the vintage cars, LA landmarks and fashions. I liked the humor spread throughout the film , especially when Cliff takes on Bruce Lee. There are a lot of scenes set on a movie set which gave the audience an interesting look at how television shows are made. The Manson Family aren't glorified in any way and are depicted for what they were, losers. Sharon Tate is in the movie more than she has to be. I suspect Tarantino wanted to show people a side of her that is not as a murder victim. There is some violence but is mostly cartoonish, and the right people get it. The final scene is both hilarious and emotionally satisfying.I've never liked DiCaprio's acting much, I find him to be watery, but this is his best performance I've seen . Pitt did a great job as Cliff. I always liked him until be met up with Angelina who Yoko Onoed his creativity. This is his best acting since The Mexican. This is QT's first movie I've liked from start to finish . In previous films there is usually a scene that turns me off,e.g., the ear scene in Reservoir Dogs, the hospital scene in Killl Bill. .Just tot be picky: There hundreds of vintage cars in the movie. But any car from the era still on the road is kept in great condition. Consequently some scenes look like they are shot at a car show. The only clunker was the Manson car but QT should have found many more of them. The soundtrack could have better, that era had so much music to choose from., Finally, the actress who played Squeaky Fromme didn't resemble her in looks , voice and personality wasn't that realistic. Squeaky is probably the most well-known of the Manson girls, so they should have got that rightI'll be seeing this movie again", "Enjoyed": "What a twist. I wasn't expecting that.

Big Kahuna Burger Billboard and Red Apple Cigarettes are a few featured. Great concept expertly executed by a fantastic cast. Tarantino is a masterful genius!", "Typical Tarantino": "That there is nothing typical about Tarantino.

I'll definitely watch it again.", "Self indulgence at it's finest!": "This indulgence fest of a movie was like watching a whole bunch of Hollywood friends, get together for a circle jerk. Definitely on my \"one of the worst movies I've ever seen\" list. Gluttonous and self indulgent to the max. Seriously, did I need to see the dog food slide out of the can and plop into the bowl every time Brad Pitt's character fed his damn dog? Or watch every clip Leo's character, the actor, played? (Maybe that's why it was nearly three hours long. It was like watching this movie and then \"Rick Dalton's\" movies. A crappy BOGO deal. Where in the world was the editor? An hour could have been deleted from this film and it would still be about nothing! Ridiculously over acted by all of the leads (excluding Margot Robbie but she was mostly just used as a prop anyway) and all were 2 dimensional cliched characters (or shall I say caricatures?). My friend and I were tempted to walk out but stayed in hopes there was a pay off. There was absolutely none. In fact the ending was just all together stupid. But if you love Tarantino camp, gore and violence, you do at least get that pay off I guess. I did give this movie two stars because the costumes and sets were amazing (as you would expect with that big of a budget), I loved the soundtrack, and the two youngest female characters (Julia Butters & Margaret Qualley) were the best parts of the entire movie. If you want to waste three hours of your life, then go see this film. If you just want to be educated on current pop culture, save yourself the time and watch the excellent trailer. Rex Reed from the Observer says it best, \"Rancid, preposterous and hysterically over the top in ideas and execution, \"once upon a time\" perfectly describes writer-director Quentin Tarantino's ninth film.\"\n\"The movie drags on like a turtle on valium, cramming in the period clich\u00e9s like concession-stand popcorn.\"\n\"They all seem to be guests at some insider wrap party to which the audience is not invited.\"\n*(random quotes from his review)", "It was okay": "Wasn't great, wasn't terrible.

It had some really good and tension-built moments, great style, distinctive camera movement and a huge homage to lesser known classic films and songs...B-Side songs from popular artists as well such as the Rolling Stones. Yet it lacked character and scene building dialog that he is so wonderful at writing. Many story threads didn't feel cohesive and the editing and pacing were uneven. It was intriguing but not overly memorable like his early film catalog. Maybe I shouldn't have gone into this completely cold; reading nothing about it...? I had to read reviews to figure out that Charles Manson's group/cult played a big part in the story.

Clearly the movie is not everyone it's not ur typical marvel movie or even tarantino movie. It focuses on the daily life and a true friendship, maybe that's the way it was supposed to be, the movie was pure it came from the hearth. If it was 40 mins shorter it would've been great, I really felt like some scenes even for tarantino were just too extended to the point I got little bit annoyed from it. The acting is great from everyone, Brad Pitt surely steals the movie as the better character. The ending Is what changed my rating little higher I really liked it even though it was short.

I like to think Tarantino makes 2 types of films, the abstract ones like Pulp Fiction and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood tend to prioritise superb cinematography to carry the story and ones like Reservoir Dogs and Inglourious Basterds tend to follow a more structured storyline. While they all tend to hit the mark, they leave you with a different feeling when you leave the cinema.Like Pulp Fiction, I love how the different character arcs come together in Once Upon a Time and you get a similar build of tension and suspense as the film develops a snail-paced crescendo throughout it's entire run time. You're not left wanting more with classic Tarantino gore, creative story telling and artful cinematography.For the first two hours you dive deeper and deeper into the finely crafted world of 1969 Hollywood. I am thoroughly impressed how believable this setting was and the sense of nostalgia and ability to romantacise the late 60s aid the films enjoyability factor greatly!My only critique which docks my rating to 8/10 is the underuse of Margot Robbie, her character was the only part of the plot which didn't quite connect perfectly with the others. Pitt and DiCaprio on the other hand had onscreen chemistry that rivals Travolta and Jackson.Overall, you're constantly thinking, constantly curious and most of all you're in for an enjoyable watch.

Yeah, the camels are cool, the somewhat truth behind some of the story was a stretch and really didn't tie together. Far too long and slow.I absolutely understand why Bruce Lee's people were upset with his portrayal in the movie. It was completely out of character according to anyone that has ever given an account of Bruce. It wasn't meaningful to the movie, it was poorly done, and deserves the criticism it received.Aside from a few movies (helped by great actors) Tarantino is mediocre.

The majority of the film moves as slow as molasses with pops of entertainment here and there. Leo's character is fantastic. Pitt is okay. Margot serves as eye candy, only. Her role in this film is absolutely pointless. Her scenes are the worst and have nothing to do with the actual plot.

I thought DiCaprio did a wonderful job playing the roll of Rick Dalton. And, the ending of the film was amazing. It definitely allows the audience to leave completely satisfied.", "Great film, visuals, and twists": "I really enjoyed this movie. Great character portrayals. Tarantino at his best.", "Not exactly what I was expecting from tarantino": "It is hard for me to review this title as I am not a professional movie critic. However as a filmmaker myself I will try to touch on what I can from a filmmakers POV. Obviously I am nowhere in the same class, atmosphere or zone as Tarantino, who I find to be one of the top film artists of the last 25 years.Once Upon a Time... is not a typical Tarantino film. Meaning it is not as blunt, graphic or violet as his previous work. Now this doesn't make it a bad experience but it definitely left me feeling a bit empty at first. Luckily I had a guild screener as was able to give it a second viewing which helped me absorb more of what Quentin was trying to put in front of me than my 1st viewing.I will say the trailers originally set my expectations very high, especially after some of the great films he brought us recently such as Hateful 8 (My personal fave of his body of work) and Django Unchained. So naturally I was expecting something in the vein of these two films and man it couldn't be further than those pictures.OUATIH is set during what some will say was the end of the golden age of Hollywood. Now having been born in 1971 I was not privy enough to this culture but have done my historical research and this film is definitely QT's love letter to that time in history.Now, I am not going to get into the whole break down of the story. I feel other imdb reviewers have touched on that enough so there is no point in me regurgitating what has already been covered.OUATIH, while a love letter, is a fictional story with a mix of real life characters and fictional characters, and takes place during a historic time in history. The mix of real life characters and the events of some of those real life characters are thrown into a mixer and swirled around into a cocktail that puts a fresh spin on the age old true story.What QUATIH successfully accomplishes is bringing to the audience relatable and likeable fictional characters who lead the main part of the story. Leo and Brad have some of the most amazing on screen chemistry and turn really fantastic performances. Although I was getting a bit impatient with The slow burn of Leo's story as Rick Dalton and felt it was dragging on, whereas Brad's character, Rick's stunt double Cliff Booth, felt like you could tell a whole other story and you would watch it because Pitt makes his character so relatable and genuine.Here is where my first problems lied within the film, as I noted my expectations where sky high for two reasons. 1. great trailers, and number 2. a new Tarantino film. I set my self up and never thought Tarantino would give us the film he did and it left me feeling bored the first time around... well at least until the last 15 minutes where the film goes full Tarantino. It was this ending that made me sit back and say \"you know, I might be missing something here, let me watch it again.\"So on the second viewing I absorbed more and could appreciate the overall package but still felt it didn't live up to its full potential. However, I will still say Brad Pitt did the most outstanding job with his character and Leo was able to play the actor within an actor within another character very well and he did give a great performance further proving he is one of the top 10 greatest talents of his generation.In the end I felt that while this is not exactly my cup of tea in QT films, it holds a place in his heart and I could see that through the presentation. Sadly, for me I wasn't able to fully connect on the level I was hoping too but that doesn't mean others will not.I will say my biggest disappointment was the under utilization of Margot Robbie, who plays a great doppleganger for Sharon Tate, just a shame though as the Tate Storyline is wasted and could easily have been left on the cutting room floor and this is from the perspective of another filmmaker. I do understand I am not QT and this is not my film, but just my opinion on the film.My advice is if you at first don't connect with OUATIH, give it another watch. Just for the nostalgia of the hollywood history it is worth a second viewing alone.In the end I couldn't give it an 8, I would say it is more a solid 7.4 and with the IMDB scale I had to round it down to a 7. But, like I said, this is my perspective.on the technical and soundtrack side this film is an 10 out of 10, but the overall package just doesn't deliver that full 8 or even the 10 I was expecting.\nP.S.

There have been a few since then I like better than others. I had very high hopes for this movie. It was an utter let down. Tarantino has become a victim of his own Coolness Factor I believe.This movie is filled with the camera shots quarky products, backgroung media (radio and t.v. in the scenes)and directing in general that have made his movies so great. But it is overfilled in a pointless manner. The movie tries to feed off of itself going nowhere for 2 hours. The last Act, which was brilliant, was overshadowed by the dragging of the first 80% of the movie.The settings, the feeling that it was filmed in the late 60s Hollywood,the dialogue for the most part (though not nearly up to bar he has set for himself)...its impeccable. But overall being lost in itself and stirring in mediocrity for so long o early on destroyed what Once Upon a Time should have been.", "Perfect Setting for a movie": "In my honest opinion, this movie made me feel like I was part of the era it was placed. In other words, it depicts a period of Hollywood in a way it makes you nostalgic about some things even if you haven't lived in that exact period.", "waste of time": "I just spent almost 3h on nothing, if you have spare time smd want to see how is possible to make long movie without telling story then watch it", "Sharon Tate": "I love what he did with the memory of Sharon Tate. She was like an enigma an innocence moving throughout the movie. If only it happened that way. I thought this was a great representation of what life would have been like in the late sixties in U.S.A. Hollywood. Great job with Quinton, Brad and Leonardo DiCaprio coming together again. All people coming into their own in this great movie. Definitely one I will watch again and again. Loved it", "Questionable Use of Three Hours": "I would genuinely rather be water boarded for 3 hours.", "Tarantino Does It Again!!": "Anyone seeing a Quentin Tarantino movie knows one thing, they are in for a ride. And that's exactly what I got from this movie. I knew that from the 2h 41 minutes that there would be a lot happening. The brilliant scope of 1969 was here and so many great memories. Add to that the Tarantino touch, and you have quite simply, a masterpiece. The cast was perfect, the sets were perfect and the story itself was just fantastic. DiCaprio and Pitt were excellent together. Even the scenes with them doing their own thing was brilliant. I loved Brad Pitt at the Spahn Ranch. Many may think that the movie lacked a plot, and that's fine, but I loved every minute of this movie. One thing I love about any QT movie is that there is always something new to see with each viewing. I find myself trying to focus intently on everything on the screen trying to pick up on some little Easter Egg and if you're a fan of Hollywood, this film has them. Sure, the last 15 minutes of the movie is fantastic, but to me, so was the other 140 minutes. I came out of the cinema asking myself one thing, What If??\nThe movie put a different twist on history and I loved it. And that's why I think it deserves such high praise. This movie has to be seen. I think it really is that good.", "A beautiful portrayal of an era in cinema, in a film that has absolutely no story for two hours.": "There are so many famous actors in this one, so many characters, and for two hours of the movie you get them built up, as they act very well in a wonderfully directed panorama of 1960's Hollywood. Then they do nothing. All that build up goes nowhere. There is a WTF Tarantino style ultraviolent scene at the end, but that has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the film and clearly does not provide closure. Tarantino movies are all well made, but some simply suck, as was the case of Death Proof. This film is very similar to that one, only it lasts for 2 hours 40 minutes. If you are the kind of person thinking that the journey is more important than the destination, you might like it, though. It's like 10 for acting, 9 for directing, 10 for the sets and atmo, 1 for story. It's that weird...I don't recommend it.", "Overrated as per usual!": "Tarantino has become so arrogant to think that he can produce any kind of rubbish and put it on screen and he'll still have his hardcore fans that will appreciate any film that has any relation to Tarantino. Put Tarantino's name on some of the worst films out there and they'd all 10 star them! This film was so utterly boring, except the last 30 minutes, which was absolutely brilliant, that's what the two stars are for because if you average it out, 30 minutes of a 2 hour 40 minute film (one star for every 16 good minutes that I watch) then it deserves 2 of them, and that's being generous! However, maybe I should give an extra star for him not having a cameo in the movie as his cameos are unnecessary, embarrassing and out of place. He needs to realise that he is NOT an actor! I went into this film with high hopes as I love the actors and I like some of his previous films like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs etc. And also enjoy stories around famous criminals like Charles Manson, which can I say, his story arc was about 40 minutes of the entire film and he was only in it for a total of 10 seconds!", "Unusual misstep for Tarantino": "I like Tarantino movies but this one missed the mark. Not sure was his vision or idea for this movie was, but it didn't come through on screen. Very few laughs and long runtime that is unnecessary. Could easily cut an hour out and not lose any substance.", "Dear god it's slow": "I'm a massive Tarantino fan and was really disappointed with this film, sadly it's the worst out of all of his creations. There is no story, and boring dialogue and long scenes without dialogue. I kept clock watching.", "I love this movie": "I think if a movie stays with you for a few days after you've seen it, it must be good. Also, this is the first time since Pulp Fiction that I've actually been back to see a movie twice in the same week. Just brilliant, thank you again Mr Brown.", "TOO BAD THE BIG ONES ARE GONE AND THIS SICK GUY IS A STAR ...": "Do not waste your time. Tarantino is the greatest film charlatan ever. He steals from others and assembles. Just another a--h-le who has got very lucky.

The longest Marlboro Man tobacco commercial in history. Every scene they are cashing in ATF sponsorship or Quentin is the biggest word-of-mouth junkie advertiser in history. Eventually the ATF and Hollywood gang will pay for damages and this is a great in court show movie. Quentin an ex-A filmmaker now B-tobacco baitch guy... Disappointing for his talent.", "Magical ingredients don't always make good soup": "Love the director love the cast, fascinated with the time period. Oh my word how could anyone mix all this together and produce so many hours of turgid dull ( oh my god is there still that long to go) tosh.Dreadful, maybe I expected too much being a fan of the period the cast and the director but no......Clearly just a self indulgent romp for Mr T. He really should have made this for himself and kept it to himself ....sad.", "I shut this off after ten minutes.": "After going absolutely nowhere for ME, I pulled the plug. Can't understand the 8.0 reviews at all. I'm not really sure who this movie was made for. I'm 50, lover of comedy, sci-fi, horror, drama, and some action, and still, it definitely wasn't for me.It had nothing that pulled me in, characters I didn't care a bit for, and just retro garbage I'm not into. Oh well.", "Gorgeous yet rather dull": "Gorgeously filmed wonderful performances and a very interesting idea, but no getting away from the fact that for two and a half hours nothing happens. I enjoyed it and respect the idea and the way it was filmed, however it's a lot of not much", "I am sorry but WHAT?": "I was so excited about this film, I didn't even watch the trailers or any interviews and went in totally blind and expected a blast of excitement and fun and truly the amazing cinematic experience Tarantino's brand promises and delivers every time.Call it a habit but I was waiting for a bang since its a Tarantino movie and the ride took off and never landed. The plot mostly fell flat. The story was everywhere and no where at the same time. I lost all the excitement after 45 minutes and the next 90 minutes were just a drag except some top notch acting from Leonardo DiCaprio. The story of the show where he asks money for the little girl seems more exciting than the film itself. Well we finally arrived at the climax after 2 hours and 23 minutes with only 17 minutes to go and well how much can happen in 17 minutes, you are right NOT A LOT. The whole Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring plot did not make any sense to me. I was hoping the characters to cross over at some point, it happened but well then the screen went dark. I was kinda disappointed with it.", "Literally nothing happens": "3 hours and not one thing happens. I kept thinking it was building to something, that conversations had purpose, but nope.Don't waste your time, you'll never get those hours back.", "A great movie worth spending your time": "Wow!!! The first time I watched this film, I laughed all the way through. The dialogue is hilarious, the situations are hysterical. The great fantastic phenomenal movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. Sometimes you may feel that the movie is long. But as you keep watching, the feeling of the movie is faster than you can imagine. Some scenes, I won't say which ones but they get brutal and kind like suspenseful and how the music sounds. Feel like you're in a horror movie which is weird but then you also feel like you're in a comedy then go to a drama. It's has everything feeling and has lots of fantastic movie scene. This movie has a ton of great actors that give a performance of a lifetime especially Brad Pitt. He's so enjoyable and also entertaining. In my opinion, he is better than Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie although Leo is in the movie more. But Brad Pitt's moments stand out more and more memorable. Margot Robbie to me felt like she having a role that is less attractive in the movie. I thought the movie would tie the three main characters together but they never did disappoint for me. (Spoiler alert!) The ending of the movie made me a little confused but Quentin Tarantino knows what he's doing and it's supposed to mean something so I'm intrigued. Overall, the movie is really good, it's fun, and there are a lot of feelings that make it perfect. This is definitely a great film and it is my second favorite Brad Pitt film of all time.", "Absolutely boooooooooring!": "Almost 3 hours happening absolutely nothing. By the time the final scene came I even didn't care about the end of the film. Don't spend your money in this. By far the worst movie of Tarantino.", "Just loved the whole thing": "Felt like being in that time, the scene setting and music was magical", "Tarantino's Finnegans Wake": "Self indulgent filmmaker makes a film for himself.", "Quentin gotten lazy": "What the hell is this. I used to be a big fan. Great acting. Horrible story and a nauseating display of wasted money.", "Long, slow and boring": "A real nothing kinda movie. Painfully boring, little to no meaningful plot partly saved by the A list cast.Not the best Tarantino has done that's for sure!", "Instant Timeless Classic": "The people that are disappointed in this film don't understand that it was never meant to have a plot, per se. It was a character study. \"Jaws\" has a plot...you could replace the entire cast (great as it was) and it's still a plot driven film....shark terrorizes vacation beach. In a film that is a character study the whole film is basically about Rick Dalton....if he isn't in it, there is no film.So people waltz in expecting a sense of direction...rather than a sense of examination.I felt like this was one of the most haunting, and uplifting films I have seen in many, many years. Lines from the characters keep coming back into your mind....the whole film did everything Quentin stated he hoped it would...made me laugh, made me jump, made me smile with a tear in the eye.Brilliant acting and production values. It's just not gonna be for the crowd that expects \"Kill Bill.\" It's a different animal.It's a new classic.", "Blistering Performances": "Another Tarantino great!You can say it's slow at the start but once again Tarantino's detail to every small sector that supports this phenomenal cast grinds you out for 2 hours. They dangle the carrot out to ensure you cant leave your seat in fear you might miss the punchline at any time. Then finally the final half hour of shear brilliance and insane amount of relentless brutality to leave you in two minds do you laugh or squirm.10/10", "If you get it, you get it.": "This is a movie where understanding the historical background and context, and knowing all the references is crucial, because the movie itself lives and plays off of it. I went into the theater not knowing anything about the Manson murders, and so I felt a little lost and confused, but thankfully my friend sitting next to me had done his research and filled me in. Once you get all the history, the movie is a MASTERPEICE, otherwise, it's a little underwhelming. Still a good movie, but just kinda underperforming.So if you have not seen this yet, go google the Manson murders. You'll thank yourself when your rating this movie a 9-10/10 later.", "Guess I didn't get it or just not for me": "Big Tarantino fan, but this one.... Maybe my mood was not set for it. I wanted an evening of entertainment but it just didn't do it for me. Watched the end of the movie waiting for something to happen, but it didn't and it left me....bored. Of course huge focus on old classic Hollywood, which was ... interesting and then the last 20 minutes the massacre with a nice twist. I didn't expect that the movie would go this way and I wasn't satisfied at the end of it. If the manson massacre was accurate it could have been a documentary about 60-70 Hollywood.", "Just \"meh\"": "Not much to say, but flat. Never going to see it again but if you want to dig into the 60's aesthetics, music, environment etc this shall be a great opportunity though.The cast is amazing, but it's not enough when you don't have a nice script to follow. The storyline doesn't go anywhere and the final plot is completely nonsense. We don't need to be skeptical at all, but the way QT tried just didn't work.I wonder if a anonymous writer and director produced and released this movie how the audience would respond. I guess we all know the answer to this and how Hollywood has its favorites no matter what.", "Double Edged Sword": "It is a double edged sword as the film will take ten stars out of ten from one viewer and at the same time another one will only give five out of ten. Lets analyze the reason for this.These incidents actually happened in Hollywood in late 60's . This film has captured those events to tell a beautiful but lost 1960's era of Hollywood. The tensions faced by the actors / support cast members to survive in Hollywood itself and the film industry have been well scripted to Rick Dalton's character. It is an era which Hollywood transit from Studios to Directors. 1970's is the era where directors got the upper hand in production and studio culture became void. Meanwhile Sharon Tate/ Polanski Saga was real and if you google 'Mansion Family', the true story will unfold about the 6 murders which actually happened on that night. When a person enters the movie with this details yeah it was a fantastic masterpiece by Tarantino.On the contrary, people who do not know this story plus Hollywood history becomes anxious and starts to feel bored. Because nothing is happening except for last 30 mins or so. But they will vote for 5 stars or more for the great design and production to recreate this 1960-70 era. It should not be easy. But the art director and director has make sure no ill-fated misses happen and the film gives 100% authentic Hollywood 60's. They will also admire the acting of DiCaprio, Pitt and Margot. When you have DiCaprio and Brad in one movie you cannot ask for more on acting front.So fives and tens will make it around 7-8 overall rating. But usually Tarantino has a reputation to attract more 7,8,9 and 10's. In this film he fails to make that Wow feeling for everyone . There is a very little for normal person who just comes out to the theater for this without any background study. I think it is a thumbs down for Tarantino.", "The movie about nothing....": "Seinfeld had a sitcom about nothing and now Quentin Tarantino has a movie about nothing, the difference being that Seinfeld is actually entertaining to watch.The main problem with this movie is that it seems to have no plot. It keeps you waiting for something to happen or a storyline to develop but sadly that does not seem to happen. The lack of storyline makes this movie excruciatingly hard and frustrating to watch. I was bored and annoyed to the point where I considered walking out.It does get a little better towards the very end but by then I was so fed up and bored with this movie that I was mainly glad it was about to end.By far the worst Tarantino movie I ever saw and the high ratings it is receiving are a mystery to me.", "Absolutely loved it": "Huge Quentin Tarantino fan. Saw this movie opening night and if I'm being fair I probably would have liked meat thrown on the screen simply because hey.. it's Quentin Tarantino.My initial thought was that it was a little long and at times a little slow. Probably because my expectation was a traditional Tarantino action bloodbath. Expectations aside I really enjoyed it.. solid 8/10.About a week after it's release I went back and saw it a second time. Knowing at that point that it was pretty much just a story about two good friends... friends that's are \"more than a brother and a little less than a wife\"... And I absolutely loved it. Took it from a 8/10 to an absolute 10/10!I'm very familiar with the Manson murders... And I can't express how much anxiety I had as that last scene was starting to develop. After all.. we all know the unfortunate reality of what happened. The anxiety was real and just like Tarantino changed history in Inglorious Bastard's... we'll... Every fairytale begins with Once Upon a Time...Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were amazing. The soundtrack was fantastic. Most of it taking place in the various cars being driven so they had the radio dj's doing there a little banter in between songs. which was a nice touch to an old timer like me. Margot Robbie was great as Sharon Tate. And Tarantino used actual footage of her when showing her movie on the big screen. A nice touch.Once upon a time in Hollywood is as good as any previous Quentin Tarantino movie. Highly recommended.", "An absolute must-see": "An absolute must-see and must-watch-again for any Hollywood movie fan: the story is fantastic, poignant, and features (to me) the best scene fight and ending (no spoiler there, just great!).", "I'm sorry I really didn't like it!": "Tarantino is like family to me, I will ferociously defend any dumb criticism directed his way, he has a direct line to my entertainment bone and that's why this stings to say but this was not... ugh damn it... this was not a good movie. Or even a Tarantino movie.Where was the story man? When have you ever not had a GREAT story, or several in a movie? It felt like a bunch of scenes ineptly stitched together, like a new director trying to show everyone how cool and different he is, not the amazing storyteller we all know and love. Nothing about this was interesting or entertaining or fluid. Never in my life have I got bored watching a Tarantino movie.Manson killings told through a sad, washed up, neighbour actor's life? Hollywood in the 60s? Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio? How do you manage to make it bomb so bad? If you just told the real story it would have written itself to be a masterpiece. If you really wanted to make something different out of this story, look into the latest (imo very reasonable and probable) theories about this tragic case and show everyone that maybe all this happened because they were too scared of going to jail for another murder.Constant clips of movies and shows the Rick Dalton appears in? Okay to watch but so bad for the pace. That pointless 20 minute suspense at the ranch? Why? Endless driving around? No real dialogue. And that dumb ending? Tate doesn't die? Wow! So interesting! Why even include them in the story if they're gonna end up as background characters in a completely different, action movie heroes save the day, everybody's happy type of reality which doesn't even look real or make us feel anything?! We all wish they didn't die but you don't go ahead and make a 3 hour movie just to lead to that wish so lazily. No real interactions between the characters, no crazy turn of events told in an intricate web of \"what if it happened this way\". Bad bad hippies get what's coming to them in a hilarious ending that's supposed to be shocking. A flamethrower as a weapon? What in the b movie hell was that?I mean Leo was great, I really felt his character's pain, that was about the only interesting thing about the movie. But even that didn't go anywhere, sudden revamping of his career told in a five minute montage and narration... I don't know, I just didn't get what QT was trying to do with this. I didn't like the ending of Inglorious Basterds either but every single scene up to the ending was such a joy to watch that you don't care about that silly turn of events at the end that could not have happened that easily. But this movie, I just kept waiting for it to get into gear but it kept sputtering fumes and ended on a really sad dying sound of an engine. 6 stars only because I can't score a Tarantino movie any lower.", "Iconic": "Near everything inch perfect. The music, fashion, cars, acting. One of Tarantino's best in a long time, and such a easy watch. This masterpiece personifies the art of storytelling and how to perfect pull off a satisfying ending.", "That train has left the station": "Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ex-TV cowboy with a waning career. His go-fer buddy and stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) has fallen on worse times, but life still goes on in 1969. They live near the Roman Polanski residence with the Manson family lurking in the background. History tells us what happens. The only question is how will Quentin Tarantino present it.I liked how the film captured the stars. You can tell whom they were even without their name being mentioned or they have a credit, such as the woman with the Joey Heatherton hair at the Playboy Mansion. Damon Herriman was not convincing as Charlie.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity", "Tarantino can't retire soon enough": "A movie with absolutely no plot. A mish mash of random scenes put together and claiming to be a movie.

Didn't bother putting it back on,I'd seen enough,40 minutes of my life I'll never get back!!", "It's not about the plot, it's about the ride": "I'm surprised to see so many people complaining that 'nothing happened' in this film. Is it because they've come to expect a certain smooth-talking, ultra-violent formula from Tarantino, which has you nervously sitting at the edge of your seat, waiting for the next turn? Probably.Yes, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a bit of a sway from Tarantino's usual formula, but that's okay. Watching this movie, I couldn't help but think that his style has matured.This movie is not about the action, it's about the characters and the stories they tell about an era passed. A golden era of Hollywood, which is masterfully recreated and thoughtfully shared with the audience, piece by piece. It's also just as much about what you don't see. Throughout the film, you're gifted with glimpses of characters and storylines, which leave you wanting to know more.If you go in expecting a non-stop thrill ride, you might be disappointed. But if you go in with an open mind and a desire to watch some brilliant actors share a thoroughly entertaining pastiche of Hollywood in 1969, you will love every minute.Oh, and if you did come for the violence, of course Tarantino delivers in the best way possible.", "Worst movie I've ever been to": "Very slow paced, no storyline, nothing really happened at all... Had very high hopes, but I recommend to stay at home and save your money..", "same...same...same": "Yes he is good. Good very good. But why am I watching almost same ups and downs in every movies of him.Very slow beginning, a bit excitement after 20 minutes, then down for a long time and boom... last 15 minutes, all over the blood and dead bodies because of high heads or psychopaths. And nomination for Academy award? No sir no.", "Absent of Tension": "Damn. Often a Tarantino film has me on the opposite edge of my seat, not so much for this one. I was so far back I was almost asleep. Very little tension here and what am I rooting for? More tension and less set up. Could have been an hour shorter.", "overall it's well-made, but doesn't quite know when to let up": "An aging (and fading) Hollywood action star is stuck in an emotional rut in the late 1960s, believing that his once prosperous career has officially gone south--a belief he confides to his best friend and longtime stunt double who, like him but for much different reasons, is also struggling to find a place in the rapidly changing Hollywood scene. By chance the washed-up star lives next door to acclaimed director Roman Polanski and his bubbly wife Sharon Tate, and believes that becoming acquainted with them will help propel his status. Tarantino's tribute to the golden age of cinema is well-crafted, features many of his frequent collaborators in key roles (including DiCaprio and Pitt who are a dream pairing) and is especially effective at capturing a specific look and feel of a memorable time period, but it goes on way too long, has a finale that's needlessly sensationalized, and a major subplot about the Manson Family that's more distracting than interesting. Until the third act the film's content is surprisingly tame, but all of its best qualities are diluted by the length of the picture. **\u00c2\u00bd", "2 hours of nothing 15 mins of action": "Seemed like this was a movie made for the actors to enjoy hanging out rather than making a quality film. It was painfully slow I actually couldn't finish it in one go. The action scene was not worth the wait imo and I was disappointed with the way women were presented in the film. I think the hype for the movie is severely overblown and if I could go back in time and watch something else in those two hours I would.", "Very mediocre.": "I love Tarantino films. This film however was a disappointment. It's the first time I watch a Tarantino film and had to check the time twice because I was tired and eager for it to finish and get out of the movie theatre.The first half an hour was extremely tiresome. Nothing happening and complete failure to capture viewers attention. The scenario was also very very poor.If it was not for the great acting of Di Caprio and Brad Pitt and the film being elegantly and carefully directed, it would not possibly get the accolades it did. I am wondering if people actually rate the film and not Tarantino. Yes Tarantino is great, but this film definitely is not his best.", "Amazing how a film about Hollywood...": "... uses so little tools from Hollywood about story telling, dramaturgy and plot development.2hrs of well shot images with no plot and the last 15min a plot develops around the murders around Charles Manson.But history even gets bent there.Annoying radio and commercials run all the time in the background.No one could have brought the script (if you can call it that) to a producer to have it made. It would have been tossed in the round bin after a few pages read.Worst movie I have seen in a long time.", "7 or 8": "Can't decide between 7 and 8! Good stuff.\nCheck it", "Finally there is a Good Movie": "Let's keep it short - would recommend this to anyone except kids.", "Really good but not as good previous Tarantino movies": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is a really good movie but not as good as previous Tarantino movies. It has no plot and all of the scenes with Sharon Tate could and should be removed. Tarantino's foot fetish is at its most uncomfortable. However, Tarantino's direction is fantastic and the film is visually stunning, feeling authentic to the time period it is set in. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt both give incredible performances and have amazing chemistry. Margot Robbie gives a really good performance, mostly relying on non verbal communication. The majority of the attempts at humour are actually funny and the soundtrack is reliably great. The extremely violent finale is incredibly fun.", "Not the usual Tarantino": "I can see why people were disappointed in this film, but I loved it. It's not like Tarantino's usual fare with action and violence woven through the entire film. In fact the only real action lasts a few minutes at the end but that was fine with me. A lot of people seem to be saying there was no story and I think this is perhaps because they were expecting it to focus on the Manson murders which turn out to be a sideline to the real story of a Hollywood actor who's star is fading and his employee/best friend. For me, this has got to be the deepest, most touching film Tarantino has ever done.\nBrad Pitt is brilliant in this, probably his best work. Even though I'm a huge DiCaprio fan, I think Pitt outshone him. I do agree that Margot Robbie could have been used more but I understand in doing that, it would have put the murders to the fore rather than the story that was really being told.\nGo into this with an open mind and I guarantee you'll be drawn in as much as I was.", "Tasteless and completely unnecessary": "I love Tarantino movies except HF8 and this one. I don't know what ran thru his brains.", "Wasn't super impressed but a great film": "Over all it was a great looking film and I did get a chance to see it on 35mm film. I guess I was waiting for an earlier pulp fiction and resovoior dogs feel. The cinematography was incredible as well as the cast. I did love the spin of the story but didn't like some of the spins like the Bruce Lee scenes. As a kid from the 90's Bruce Lee was my hero. Not giving away any spoilers its worth watching and I think any Tarantino fan will defiantly enjoy it.", "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Review: DiCaprio and Pitt shine in Tarantino's Love-letter to the 60's": "The trailers for this film got me incredibly excited as I felt like it gave me a glimpse into Tarantino's mind. This feels like his version of the 1960's - and it's stunning in its visuals alone. No CGI of any sort, just classic practical effects. Going back to basics some might say. That's not exactly a bad thing, in fact it's the opposite. I loved this film from beginning to end. The long run-time might put off some viewers but to me it's a glorious tribute to cinema, Tarantino-style.The performances from DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie are all great - they complement each other very well. DiCaprio and Pitt are unabashedly charming. Brad Pitt's character, Cliff Booth, is especially bombastic and head-strong, while DiCaprio exudes a bitter-sweet Big Lebowski vibe - I loved them equally. Robbie's performance is great as well. Despite not having as much screen time as Pitt and DiCaprio, she is very able to hold her own.The music in this film is fantastic. Tarantino's love for the 60's shines through here even more and the soundtrack just adds to the atmosphere with tracks from artists like: Paul Reeves and The Raiders and Roy Head & the Traits. In addition to the wonderful tracks that play throughout the film there are also fascinating radio snippets before and after some of the songs played. This again all adds to a soundtrack that has become one of my favourites already.The streets of Los Angeles are a wonder to view and they all look recreated rather than using a green screen. This only piles on the amount of clear and evident effort that Tarantino has put into this movie. He is one of the only directors around that still uses film to shoot his scenes, rather than falling back on digital like everyone else.All this culminates in one of the craziest finales that I've seen. The contents of which I will not spoil. All I will say, it's one of my favourite sequences seen in a long while.In conclusion, I cannot express how close this got to overthrowing The Favourite as my best film of the year. It sits at 2nd place - which isn't exactly a bad place to be.5/5 Thumbs\nHighly recommended!!", "research real story before watching the movie": "The reason I liked this movie is because I read about Sharon Tate murder. If you don't read and make research - some things just don't make sense. E.g. Bruce Lee makes no sense unless you know Polanski suspected him in murdering Tate. And of course I liked the ending a lot, it was bittersweet, totally something I did not expect.", "The Greatest Duo in Hollywood": "One of the best movies of 2019 and Tarantino's best movie. The soundtrack is insanely good and it's one of the greatest soundtracks ever. Tarantino never misses with the music. It captures the atmosphere of Los Angeles in the 60's perfect. You could argue that this movie has more style than substance and that's okay! It is indeed beautifully crafted. Everything from the characters, the clothes, the environments, the acting, and the music to the props. It may not have the clearest plot but it still works great. An old and ugly film cannot lean as much on the looks and music as their technology is outdated, but this film can.It's actually a good plot with nuanced and interesting characters. However, Margot Robbie's character doesn't do much besides looking cute but she's fun and compelling to watch. Brad Pitt is an old war hero who is a little crazy and DiCaprio is an old \"has-been\". Brad Pitt gets a lot of credit for his performance in this movie (which is understandable) but he's not the best-acted character in the movie.DiCaprio deserves much more credit. Pitt's performance is great but perhaps not Oscar-worthy. Pitt is just really cool, handsome and funny, but not much more than that. Both Pacino and Pesci were arguably better that year. Also, DiCaprio was better than Pitt in this movie. DiCaprio could've won an Oscar that year if it had not been for Joaquin Phoenix's outstanding performance in \"Joker\". DiCaprio's scenes where he plays an actor playing a character are great. Another good detail is when he stutters when he is nervous which makes his character feel more real. This is the movie where DiCaprio's acting feels the most natural ever. But Pitt and DiCaprio together are undeniably one of the absolute greatest duos in Hollywood ever!In conclusion, it's just such an awfully good movie. Everything is so neat and tidy. You can't go wrong with a film directed by Tarantino and starring Brad Pitt and Leonardo Davinci. The best scenes are when Brad Pitt is driving. Love the old Cadillac.", "Thanks to Tarantino's magic, you are breathing 1969 Los Angeles.": "Great leading performances and wonderful chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt elevate Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, creating a thoughtful, tantalizing glimpse at the Hollywood of yesteryear and what might have been.", "Oh dear": "My goodness, this was terrible. One really has to be buying into the idea that because a director once did something interesting that everything that follows naturally must be brilliant, doesn't it? That's why delusional Hollywood marketing executives try to sell the \"directed by Oscar winning x\" director that never convinced any thinking person to be actually of value. What an exhausting task to perform to make it to the end of this irrelevant twaddle. The actors were never very talented when compared to real actual actors but this one takes the cake. 70s sitcoms had better pretension to offer. This delivers nothing but embarrassment. One feels ashamed for what goes on. And on it goes. The minutes just won't go by. And one wishes they would. This must be watched under the influence of many different drugs to not cause serious depression.", "Wow~I Want to See It Again!": "I've not been in a movie theater in four years because all that appears at the local theaters are endless fantasy figure clones that's impossible for me to enjoy. The Fantastic Four, the Avengers, Captain America, the endless sequels of old masterpieces (think: Halloween, Friday the 13th, Godzilla.)\nBut then I rented this movie and was mesmerized and thrilled by what Tarantino had done. The late sixties was among my most memorable time in life. I remember being obsessed--along with everyone--with the Charles Manson cult and the horrific murders at the Roman Polanski residence and the nightmarish murder of its inhabitants. All of this plus a fascinating story line of a changing Hollywood, the deluge of cowboy television series that saturated our television airwaves. The Hippie phenomenon, the burst of new musical sounds.\nThe cast is magical with Leonardo di Caprio and Brad Pitt bringing us stunning performances that deserve all the praise and awards they received. The rest of the cast is spot-on. That wild and crazy ending was like a cherry on the top of an incredibly delicious sundae.\nThe outtakes on the disc are all important and contain delightful scenes that are just as entertaining as the feature film.\nI'm adding this title to my library. This is an instant movie classic that we'll be re-watching and discussing for years to come. And it'll give incentive for us to go back and study the Charles Manson murders all over again.", "My honest thoughts about 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood'": "Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood was for the most part a pretty good movie. Despite the lack of violence or drugs which are often present in a regular Tarantino flick, This film manages to be entertaining with well written dialogue and great performances. So while it felt different, it left me with one question: Is there an extended cut? The majority of the flick has the films two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, going about their typical day in Hollywood. It's really entertaining to watch the two in their respective roles deliver memorable performances. The film does kind of like this parallel story telling technique so as you get to know what goes on in the lives of the three main characters. And what bothered me a bit was that the third main actor, Margot Robbie who plays Sharon Tate, never really blossomed for me. That's why I wondered if there is going to be an extended version released. She was there but what was the purpose? As a stand alone movie it still manages to get an interesting story across. Heck, Dicaprio and Pitt's characters stories are fun to watch on their own. Comparing it with other Tarantino movies, I think it doesn't match up well. Still, there were plenty of parts in the movie that I enjoyed. Like every now and then it has a tendency to show footage of the actor's work. And it looks so real, you would think that this was shot with a camera from the sixties. I can admire what was the goal of Tarantino when it came to making this movie. He wanted to give a tribute to the Hollywood he grew up with. And if that was the case, then I think it was a success.", "Having \"From Dusk Til Dawn\" flashbacks....": "Well fleshed our characters-the ones that are fictitious, any way-and brilliant acting (especially from Leo and Brad), and a story that slowly (emphasis on slow) sucks you in as to where the fictitious storyline and the true crime story will end up...Tarantino has that ability when it comes to screenwriting...then, you get to the climax, and he hands it off to a 14 year old gamer boy, and says, \"Finish it\"...said the same about \"From Dusk Til Dawn\"...if you consider that one a classic, consider this one as 2.0...if you were unfulfilled the first time around, odds are high this film will leave you in the same predicament when the end credits roll....", "Loved this film": "I don't get the negative reviews. Ok some of it dragged. I found a real sadness to the film seeing Tate. I think everyone through all the film had the ending on their mind and how it'd be handled. The rest of the film was enjoyable also!I've read critics reviews about the ending..they are wrong.I'd of rather than ending played out like that in real life and I think it was executed brilliantly. Definitely stands as an amazing film, bunch of stupid brainwashed cult members getting what they deserved. Sadly it didn't.", "Don't lower your standards because you like the director.": "Although I thoroughly enjoyed Pulp Fiction and I really liked the story of True Romance, admittedly I'm not a Tarantino fan. However, I continue to watch his films because I am curious to see whether the hype is warranted... Unfortunately, once again, I feel Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is another grossly overrated Tarantino film.In a nutshell, the film has no plot. There's lots of drawn out dialogue, random and pointless 60's icons pop up every so often for no specific reason, there are plenty of drawn-out shots of LA highways and Tarantino's foot fetish goes into overdrive in this film...I mean, the foot thing is just weird!Furthermore, talent is wasted here. Margot Robbie is proving herself to be a talented actor, but she has very little dialogue throughout this film. Damon Herriman was amazing as Charles Manson in Mindhunter, but he makes one very brief appearance in this three hour mess.For the sake of being impartial, I'll say that Brad Pitt puts in a decent performance, but even his character is slightly flat. Yet, he was easily most memorable throughout the whole film. I would add that the hyper violent end is funny and that's about it.In spite of Tarantino's devoted cult following and all the celebratory ink that floods his movie reviews, it seems to me that his career peaked shortly after it started.\nIt is said that if you can't explain the film's plot in one sentence, then it's not worth your time and that is the case with Tarantino's latest work. He attempts to cover the lack of content in his films with the number of big name stars he attracts, but even they can't fill the emptiness of this bore.", "An utter waste of time for a weak message.": "It is not a bad movie per se, but Tarantino is all over the place like he's the first person who transports us to the late 60's - DiCaprio and Pitt are amazing but not all stories are made to be modified.The one thing I did like is how he reflects our \"drama selling culture\" - although coming from the Weinstein's wing, Tarantino should keep quiet - and how Hollywood works around tragedy, but that's just the last 5 mins. This movie could've easily lasted 1 hr tops but the go big or go home that has become a brand in Tarantino's movies really missed the spot on this one - an utter waste of time for a weak message.", "Extremely Boring": "No story, no action, no script. Worst movie seen lately...\nDon't get fooled by these 10/10, I can't believe how people find this good. I lost my 2h40 forever...", "Absolute pants...until the end!": "This movie has no beginning, no middle but has one hell of an end!Unfortunately the 10 minutes at the end doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being a complete waste of time!Worth a watch if you have a spare two and half hours!", "You have to have a certain knowledge of some of the celebrities in the movie": "If you know the real fate of one of the characters (real one), the ending is touching, and actually very moving. I loved this movie, it represents a pure fantasy... this is the magic of a large part of cinema; hence the title.\nEven without knowing the celebrity's real fate, you can still appreciate the blinks (\u00ab homages \u00bb) towards some the realities of Hollywood (i. e. The struggle of maintaining a good and consistent acting career, the camera frame playing, action poses, differences if innocence in acting, iconography etc).\nOf course, Tarantino's violent end climax is for me, a classic. Bravo !", "Great, mature directing and acting": "Probably the best Tarantino movie so far, you need to know some of the story behind to make complete sense of the director's interpretation and intention. Acting was excellent in my opinion.", "Beware the Ellipsis...": "Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood reminded me of the great scene in the novel Wonder Boys where our writer's best student tells him, in unmerciful detail, exactly what's wrong with his bloated kraken of a manuscript.To wit, Tarantino's title ellipsis covers all manner of sins.Within 10 minutes, you see plenty of what's wrong with this film: the meandering sets in, with throwaway characters and snippets amidst endless, unremarkable driving. I rolled my eyes.My gut said 'Leave!' and I should have.That snippet is a stand-in for the whole film. It's beautifully shot, well acted (Brad Pitt loses himself in Cliff Booth), the mood is struck, the period details are lovingly rendered. None of which adds up to a good or coherent film.A director can certainly tell a whole story with no plot...there's just little evidence of it in this scattershot mess.Give Tarantino credit for a perfectly captured moment in time and place. But the constant unspooling of unrelated or 'so what' set pieces never left room to step into his world.The marketing team did an admirable job selling this, but there were a lot of groans and walk-outs in my showing.Maybe if you have a specific appetite for late '60s LA/filmmaking you won't resent OUaTiH three hours later.", "How anger was different this time?": "Tarantino is angry, very angry.\nTarantino can easily take you on a journey of anger. He can offer you a shocking scene at the beginning of the film as usual in his previous works. However, this time Tarantino is angry at the stagnation, slowness, stereotyping, and the change in the American cinema and the American society that happened in the 60s.In \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" Tarantino presents 190 minutes of a stagnant, negative, and slow story, to put us in the psychological state that would make the anger and violence at the end of the film have a different impact on us.My first impression of the movie was disappointment. I couldn't find the usual Tarantino I am used to. However, after re-reading it, I got a different idea about what was Tarantino trying to communicate.When you choose to watch a movie by Robin Williams, you expect and wait to laugh while watching the movie. When you choose to watch a Wes Anderson movie you expect to be impressed by the cemetery of the cadres and genuine composition of the image. When you choose to watch a movie by Tarantino, you are undoubtedly expecting a film with a special taste of a director whose films are based on several distinctive themes that have made his films taste different.\nFor example, all of Tarantino's films are based mainly on the idea of revenge. All of his characters in the films have Nicknames, and he is generally fond of low angle shots, and it is also his habit to appear as an actor in most of his films.This is his special recipe. Therefore, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is different as it does not contain those elements as clearly as the rest of his films. But despite this, the film is not bad at all, it's just different.Tarantino loves breaking the rules, he rebels on everything that makes sense and expected. In this film, I think he is rebelling against himself and our \"expectation\" of his style.So, what is Tarantino trying to say? And what makes him angry this time?I think that Tarantino presents to us the changes that dominated the end of the 1960s in American cinema, and the society as well. There was a huge movement of replacement, a new wave of European filmmakers came with their style and images and replaced some genuine cinematic forms. The American society as a whole was witnessing the rise of Hippies, and their domination of many things that has been possessed by the previous generation. Tarantino made that very clear in the sequence of Spahn farm. (I personally didn't like the way Hippies were portrayed in the movie).This is evident in several scenes as the film tells the story of a famous American actor \"Rick Dalton\", who was about to lose his glamor and become forgotten. He is always accompanied by his friend, the stuntman, \"Cliff Booth\".At the beginning of the film, Rick faces the problem. Al Pacino, who plays a role as producer explicitly says to him: \"Your fame is on the verge of danger, try to go elsewhere where you could still shine, try Italian movies.\"Rick becomes very angry at this suggestion and strongly rejects it, but at the end of the film, we find him coming back from Italy after making four films there and even married an Italian woman who accompanied him to his home in Hollywood.Also at the beginning of the first chapter, we find Rick Dalton surprised by the residence of Roman Polanski, the Polish director next to him.\nIronically, Polanski at this time had made several great works in Poland such as Knife in the Water but had not done anything in American cinema, he had not yet presented his masterpiece Chinatown. Despite this, Rick is desperately eager to work with him. However, at the end of the film, we discover that Polanski and his friends were passionate about getting to know Rick and wishing to be with him.Tarantino then presents this to us in Steve McQueen's comment on Sharon Tate during the pool party. He comments on the absurdity of her emotional relationships as she rejected her American fianc\u00e9 and traveled to Europe and got in touch with Polanski and came with him to America while her former fianc\u00e9 was still waiting desperately for the moment she separates from Polanski and gets back to him.It appears that it makes sense that Tarantino pours his anger on that group of Europeans who broke into that Hollywood composition and led to this chaos. Surprisingly, it explodes in ten minutes of violence against three Hippies teenagers who broke into Rick Dalton's house.Those last 10 minutes of \"Tarantino violence\" were a vent for what was kept pressured for two and a half hours. The Hippies have been severely beaten with the distinctive Tarantino imprint when the violence blends with comedy as you watch a fierce street fight between three Hippies in one hand, a man and his dog and a half-naked woman speaking only Italian.\nBut was it the Hippies who deserved anger and punishment in this film? Was Tarantino trying to say that America was punishing the wrong party? Or did he want to say something else?Additionally, the film recalled some of Tarantino's other works, such as burning out the Nazis, the bar scene and the hostages.\nThe film also presents Leonardo DiCaprio in a superbly complex role, provoking compassion and laughter.\nBrad Pitt, too, despite the tiredness and exhaustion that appeared clearly on him - perhaps because of his 50-year-old age while presenting a character in the mid-30s - played a distinctive role with a wonderful comedic glimpse, manifested in most scenes including his fight with Bruce Lee.The film is so good, different, and interesting.I am not an expert of the history of the Hippies in America, but I think they have been unfairly portrayed and stereotyped in the film.\nIn the end, it is one of Tarantino's best feature films, and I hope he doesn't quit directing after his next film as he said.", "Masterpiece, Masterclass": "It may be take a while before we realise just how special this movie is because it's so different and complex. Fiction with nostalgia transposed onto a factual infamous crime. It's also entertaining, funny, clever and eye catching. You want to be there! The performances across the board are superlative. Is it a perfect movie? No, it felt 15 minutes too long but everyone I know came out talking about it for days. Certainly a masterpiece from the master.", "Just a quick review/comment...": "As others have said, the film is a little long - however the acting is terrific, as is the mood of a long-gone era. I see that some have knocked the ending. I feel quite the opposite. It made me feel even more sad for the victims, as we all know what actually happened.", "Boring most of the time!": "The acting and direction were very good.\nThe script was horrible.\nThere were times that I wanted to scream from boredom.\nThe movie could be 40-50 minutes smaller, too many \"slow\" scenes\nwithout any meaning to the whole story. Oh, what story..?", "So I must have missed the point": "If I'm quite honest I walked out of the movie theatre just the same as I walked in. I purposefully didn't look at any trailers or read anything on the film. Seeing how I absolutely loved The Hateful Eight I thought that this, or anything by Tarantino for that matter, would be great. I was wrong. This movie was a whole lot of, well, nothing.My impression of this film is that Tarantino got bored of not being in the spotlight and just wrote a script over a weekend and gathered up as many big names he could to make this movie. So let me first start on a positive note, the acting is incredible. Leo and Brad are very convincing in their roles. Everyone else was good too, but most of the big names had very very little parts to play. Dakota Fanning was in this movie for maybe 5 minutes to play a crackhead. Tommy Lee Jones say in a bar from start to finish and he only got about 5-10 minutes of screen time.So back to the point, I don't really know how to write this bad review. Mostly because I don't know what I just watched. I don't know what the point of this movie was. If I had to give a rundown of it and explain the whole thing, this is what it would be... (don't worry, no spoilers here. Not that there's anything to spoil)Leo and his stunt double had buzzing careers in the film industry, when Leo finds out that he doesn't have the audience he once did and his career is going downhill at record speed, he decides to start acting in Italian films. Meanwhile Margot Robbie was just the neighbour and wife of a famous director. She spends her time in this movie simply walking around town. Leo starts filming and is struggling with remembering his lines. Brad Pitt drives around, then fixes Leo's antenna that blew down. Then he goes for a drive and picks up a 16 year old hooker. Takes her back to her trailer park and there's he goes to see his old boss there. The kids get angry and slash his tires and he beats the one up and makes him fix the tire. After that he picks up Leo and Drives home. They go drinking and then get back home. Then there's a break in and a big fight with the hippies, Brad goes to the hospital and Leo goes to meet his neighbor. The end.Firstly, the hippies had no real reason to want to kill Leo. They were high and explained that they wanted to kill all the people who taught them to kill in movies. Pretty weak, I didn't buy it. But okay sure.Brad Pitt apparently killed his wife. We see a 15 second flashback to that scene and nothing after. There was never any follow up.I don't understand what the neighbors role was in this movie. Margot Robbie was all over the cover of this film but literally all she does is walk around town then go see a movie, then go to a dinner with her friends.This entire movie was just a waste of good talent and my time. I don't see how people are rating it so highly. Maybe I was just wrong for expecting something with a little more Action or mystery like his last film. The critical reception is very good for this movie so hopefully he uses that not to make another movie like this but to get back to his old style.", "Wtf did I just watch?": "1 start for Leo, 1 star for Brad. The rest is garbage!", "Terrible film!": "I am so disappointed and feel like this movie was a waste of my time and money! The storyline was weird, boring, and the end was so horrible and disturbing that I left the theatre. Hollywood is a ridiculous mess and I don't even want to go to the movies if this is what they produce! NOT worth it!!!", "Boring... Just So Boring": "I'm just shocked that a QT movie could move so SLOW. I couldn't tell where this movie was headed for most of it, and I'm still not sure what the real plot line actually was. My advice to anyone considering a watch is to pay attention to the negative reviews... and ignore all the 10 ratings from QT fanboys. I've truly enjoyed his other movies, PF, KB, RD, H8 and the rest- and really looked forward to this one. Except for the final 20 minute signature gore and \"weirdness\" action, this was a boring snoozefest. Pitt and Leo are very good actors (Robbie not so much, but nice to look at), but the \"dog\" ended up being the character I enjoyed most. >;-)", "I want my 2 hours back": "Totally pointless and convoluted. It's like that annoying person who knows someone famous who has to remind everyone that they know some famous. It's well acted but pointless. And seriously Leo stop crying. It reminds me of the big lubowski (sp?) another terrible pointless movie. It feels like aweful people doing aweful things to each other or blithely wandering aimlessly. I really have a hard time caring about anyone in the movie.", "A mixed bag": "Large portions of the movie kept me engaged, but as a whole it was too meandering. The finale was entertaining, but not exactly satisfying.I think with a more cohesive plot and a bit more time in the editing room, this would have been killer, but as is it just didn't do it for me.", "\"ANYBODY ORDER FRIED SAUERKRAUT!?\"": "All star cast, great story, incredible budget and production value. It's great seeing dicaprio back acting again especially with someone like Pitt at his side. Was easily one of the funniest films ive seen this year.", "Strangely Good": "Well, the first two hours is a bit hard to enjoy if you are not used to the American late 60s. The cast is incredible as usual and that was the main reason that kept my attention. Music was unbelievably good and well suited. The events chain is somehow similar with the Pulp Fiction but it's in a bit different style. The brutal action scenes were highly creative and were really brutal, I was shocked when the dog food thing happened.\nI wonder how the gun is able to fire after it was soaked in that pool.\nI think both the DiCaprio and Pitt were awesome.Long story short, I recommend.", "2 hours & 41 minutes of my life I want back": "What & where was the storyline? If this wasn't Tarantino it wouldn't have got anywhere near release. A massive disappointment, Pitt & DiCaprio do their best & the film looks good, but this is self indulgent nonsense. AVOID", "And The Winner is ?? Django Unchained": "I absolutely agree with some of the other reviews supporting the lack of story line.\nhad their been a plot this would of been worthy of the very high ratings from the people that thought this was Once Upon a time in America with robert deniro however instead we get a Film with a series of stand alone Film Clips secondary to a Masterpiece of visual excellence successfully capturing the time period including superb Acting from DiCaprio and Pitt reminiscent of (Redford and Newman) surrounded by a Masterpiece of set design", "It may not be Quentin Tarantino's greatest film that he made, but it's still one of his best alongside with his previous works.": "Quentin Tarantino always has been a very fascinating director / writer for me, who separates himself from other filmmakers and makes films that are not only fun to watch, but also very interesting and amazingly written. When i think of screenwriters, who write dialogue that is very intriguing to hear - Aaron Sorkin and Quentin Tarantino always comes to my mind and both stand out the most for me, but that doesn't mean that there are not other writers that haven't written great scripts with great dialogue: like Stanley Kubrick, Christopher Nolan, Charlie Kaufman, Martin Scorsese and many more, which all of them are my favorite directors / writers of all time. Now that Tarantino released his 9th film called Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in the cinema and having the chance of seeing it now, i'm happy to say that he didn't disappoint me at all.Just like in every film by Tarantino - the acting is once again fantastic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt give the best performances of the year, but i'm not so sure if it's their best that they've ever given, but either way both of them are great in the film and prove that they are the best actors that we have today. They give lives to the characters that they play and i was so invested throughout the story, because of them. It's very sad that we don't see them together all that much, since they have their own adventures, but when they are not separated - it's great and they both have a great chemistry. Even the actors (like Al Pacino), who have small roles in the film were very memorable.Tarantino perfectly captures the 60s not only with the music, but with the production design as well. The way L.A. looks is very good with the smallest attention to detail that is full of pop culture references, movie posters and even showing scenes of old films of that decade; the editing works perfectly; the sound is great throughout the entire film; the cinematography is very well done; it is very dialogue driven, but it's still very interesting to hear and doesn't loose it's audience (but it does that in some occasions) and has a very simple story, but the execution is what makes it great.Of course, the film isn't perfect and there were some moments that it did lost me completely. The characters of Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski, who are supposed to be very important are unfortunately the weakest characters in the entire film. The actor, who plays Polanski is good, but his character doesn't appear all that much. The one that suffers the most in my opinion is Margot Robbie, who give a very OK performance, but her character is the one that stand out as the most problematic. Her dialogue was very minimal and i found it very average throughout her scenes and feeling that she was very miscast in the film. Her character did nothing in the story, she didn't felt all that important and when the story focuses on her, it's very uninteresting and the pacing suffers because of that.Overall this is for now the best film of 2019. It may not be Quentin Tarantino's greatest film that he made, but it's still one of his best alongside with his previous works.", "A boring mess.": "Don't waste your time on this pretentious waste. It was like a 12 year old put his childish fantasies into a film. No redeeming qualities at all.\nWill definitely not stand the test of time !!", "not": "Will start with the very, very few things that didn't quite come off for my tastes. Some of the pace, especially for a film as long as it was, could have tightened and not every scene felt necessary. Actually would have trimmed some or all of Sharon Tate in the cinema, regardless of how beguiling the production values and Margot Robbie's (that smile is a beauty) acting were.", "More overated rubbish from the Greatest Conman": "The movie is down to the recent levels of this directors offerings. A wandering tale, poorly told and frankly for the majority of the time pretty boring. No change that, very boring. A huge waste of acting talent highlighted by a frankly childish script. I have no idea how Tarantino has conned the American public into thinking his films are anything but B grade offerings. This is no exception. Pitt stands out but frankly Decaprio is for much of the time embarassing though no one is helped by poor make up and clumsy direction.\nNaturally Tarantino closes with a laughably cheap bloodbath. What is it all about ? Not much really, a film too easily forgotten.", "Could've been so much better": "Tarantino created some good material over the years but maybe he should've watched this first before sending it off to production. If you're going to decide to make a movie this long make sure there is some sort of climax. One doesn't have to stretch every flick to a lengthy ordeal if one thinks that is going to make it good. There were a few funny and good scenes, yet too few and too many average. Taking the piss out of Bruce Lee has been done before and done better-it was cringeworthy. Plus mixing reality with fiction in the wrong way is like eating a hot dog with whipping cream. I think Brad Pitt and L DiCaprio made the most of their roles. I did enjoy the beautiful feel and scenery of the free Californian times of that era. But really the tittle should've been: The Story of Ugly Dirty Feet of Bubbly Hollywood Broads.\nI only watched it because it was a Tarantino film and I think many would agree...", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: Quick Capsule Review": "Meandering nonsense about an over-the-hill actor and his stuntman best buddy. Didn't even contain the usual self-aggrandising dialogue one comes to expect from Tarantino, so it's not even like I could hate it for that. Film ppl will endeavour to fool you into thinking that you just don't love \"cinema\" enough to get it.Painfully dull and unappealing, albeit with some good performances.", "Quent..tarantino 9th movie": "Tarantino's movies are the best for me in the cinema industry. I loved this movie. A little bit more soft in general, the kick ass part is just amazing and I think the movie just couldn't finish like that... That's why my 8/10.", "Meandering": "The writing isn't very good. The movie meanders. There's no reason for the 2 hour 40 minute running time. Still, I wasn't sorry I saw it. I share the director's affection for this time and place. Looking at Brad Pitt for three hours is never a bad thing. He gave a very good performance as a stunt man who didn't take crap from anyone, but you have to be disturbed that his character might have killed his wife and gotten away with it.I could have done without a lot of the violence in the movie, which sometimes had a horror movie quality.Strangely, Manson and his followers looked more like actors than the actors playing them. At times the aesthetic of the late sixties was captured perfectly, like Tarantino's homage to LA's neon signs. The way people talked and acted was sometimes portrayed faithfully, at other times not.Overall, a lot of people would be glad to see this film, but it can be amateurish and undisciplined.", "Real waste of nearly 3 hours": "Total let down. Very ardent supporter of Quentin. Seen all his movies. This was totally without a proper plot. Just aimless mindless drifting. I kept wanting for something to happen. Even the ending was out of context. Sigh. Far cry from his recent movies. The casting was impeccable. So was the acting. But there was no direction what so ever.", "REACTION REVIEW": "Now I'm a Tarantino fan, and there's lots of flare in there, but I just got a bit bored. Plenty of moments were great but it seemed like Mr T has gotten to a point where he can shoot what he wants and tell the editing room to do one. I kinda admire it because the man has an incredible catalogue of films - so if this is his opus then good for him. I'm just not really that big a fan of feet or clued up on my hollywood lore so it simply didn't bite. 45mins shorter and I might've given it more. After a bit more research and understanding maybe I'll do the same but initially, it was good but not great.", "Not Your Typical Tarantino but It Still Packs The Punches": "Having heard some reviews and seen some that thankfully did not give anything away I essentially went in blind despite hearing the ending was ridiculous. Well, the ending if you watch the film straight through is a doozy and fits the story completely. Many will go in assuming Tarantino dialogue, a killer soundtrack and tons of violence. That last bit is still present but not in huge doses as we all know from Quentin's past is everywhere whether good or not.The film's core is about the past of actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his best friend and former stunt double (Brad Pitt) and the present. Rick feels he is washed up as an actor and seems to be stuck in villain mode when he lands an acting gig. Many humorous scenes involve an emotional Dalton angry at himself for blowing lines or thinking his acting sucks, whereas his pal Cliff runs errands, feeds his dog and drives around meeting all types.Everyone in the film is perfectly cast especially DiCaprio, Pitt & Robbie. Outside of Fight Club, Brad Pitt has never been better and Leo shows he has a humorous side which I never knew existed to this extent. Robbie breathes life into an actress who was sadly mainly known as a murder victim to most of the world. The few scenes she is in as it is not her story are very sweet, touching, and interesting. Pitt steals every scene he is in and I found myself loving every time he was on screen. When together with Leo the chemistry is off the charts.I know many Tarantino die hards may likely or let's face it will be disappointed save for the last 20 minutes as they will assume it is going to be more of the same. Thankfully it is not. Outside of a few intense scenes this is something Tarantino has been building towards his entire career and although it is long and a slow burn it truly pays off.", "Worst movie of the year": "Tarantino needs to think if he wants to be remembered for movies like Pulp Fiction etc or a falling star.\nNot even Di Caprio or B Pitt saves this from disaster. No plot. Boring characters. It pains me as an huge Tarantino fan to see this.\nGlad I didn't see it in theaters!!", "Indulgent Mess 6.5/10": "Where at the end of it all, I came out quite disapponted, in a few small measures. I never would of expected it, especially with this movie, which should be called \"Once Upon A Time In Quentiniville\" as this larger than life, louder than life movie (with great track photography, where you'll almost feel in there in some shots) is just him, paying homage to his movies and the stars that inspired him. He really indulges with this one, over the top, and this is one of the negatives, as well as the annoying and constant voice overs, with all those times flashed on the screen. I was in awe, where these unnecessary, endless V.O'S really got on my goat, where I was nearly at the end of my tether. There's nothing worse than watching a film, and be verbally fed information, while watching it. What the F? The Manson role, has never had smaller air time, and almost doesn't exist, played by a great Aussie actor, I was excited to see much more of in this. All is good with this film, probably up until the last 45-50 minutes, and it all goes haywire. A ridiculous scenario, built around the Manson followers night of killing is just made a mockery of, where it just goes off the radar, reality just goes out the window. There's a lot of QT humor in this one, though, and the performances are gold, from an elite pool of professionals, so many who impress, save for the dreadful Zoe (Kiwi accent) Bell. The late Luke Perry was one of those pros, but it was Margot Robbie, who shines out from all the others. The 4 actors, playing real actors, bloody got em' right, the Bruce Lee, portrayal was spot on. I can't believe, people walked back during the end credits, to watch Leo's character, doing a Red Apple cigarette ad, referenced in Pulp Fiction, in that scene of static with Willis and Travolta. OUATIH could of really been something, if ruined for those last fifty minutes. I loved Brad Pitts character in this. If you're in the acting biz, this one will hit too close to home, or sting. Like footballers, actors are expendable, but Robbie is a true jewel, among all those roughs. Still, it's a movie experience, well experiencing, but sadly becomes a mess in that mentioned final third time frame. Oh Quentin. 6.5/10", "My favorite Tarantino in a while": "Dreamy and nostalgic, with two great leads, this is a story walking a thin line between reality and \"could have been\".DiCaprio is Rick Dalton, a fictional actor whose time in the limelight is running out. Pitt is his stunt/handyman Cliff Booth. The two share a friendship and wander around in a Hollywood undergoing a disintegration under pressure by the \"youth-quake\", the hippies and all the political upheaval of the late 60s.Two lost souls who would have been more at home in the studio system of the preceding decade, Dalton and Booth try to fit in and stay relevant, fail and eventually move to Cinecitt\u00c3\u00a0 for some spaghetti westerns.Back in Hollywood, they get mixed up with hot and upcoming neighbour couple Tate/Polanski and with some nasty hippies.As in \"Inglorious Basterds\" the mix of reality and fantasy works out quite well. No major violent scenes, except towards the end, but even there, not what you would expect.", "If You Didn't Like This Movie, I Feel Sorry For You": "This film gave me so much joy and pleasure, I can only wish the same for everyone else. The movie breaks any mold you might have been expecting, and takes the viewer into a new place of cinematic entertainment.\nI confess, I am hyper-focused on this precise time in American history...the summer of '69. The moon landing, then Manson ruining everybody's peace trip.\nQT did me a huge personal favor in making this film.\nSo, strap in, tune out, and enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime ride.", "Overrated and pointless": "I don't understand the point of this movie. So many good actors doing so very little for no good reason what so ever.Tarantino obviously is a very overrated director as seen the past few movies and I have to assume that's the only reason he gets to turn out movie after movie. It's not that they are badly put together, to the contrary in this case it's very well filmed. It's just that there's absolutely no point to it, none what so ever.If you haven't seen it yet, it's no loss. Don't bother. If you've already seen the last Avengers or Star Wars, go see one of those again instead of wasting money on this one. It will give you a lot more satisfaction for sure.", "Interesting": "I thought this was going to be full garbage and I was very hesitant to watch it, but after sitting through it, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I wouldn't class this as a comedy at all, more of a drama. The acting was good, but then we had two of the greatest actors so that's no surprise.", "Mixed bag and not Tarantino's best": "The first half was a real mish mash imo, kinda boring and I was like what is the story even. When the Dakota Fanning scene kicked in I wasn't bored though and it continued to be entertaining from there on. Brad looked great and gave an awesome performance. Margot was kinda meh though. Overrated but okay movie.", "Disappointing plot": "I was so anticipated to watch the new Quentin Tarantino's movie.\nAs a fan of his movies, as I walked out of the cinema I was confused and didn't believe that this is the big hype.\nI gave the movie 6/10 because of the acting, production and Quentin's mind but the plot is not.", "crap movie": "2:45 mins of crap...besides the last scene...this movie has to good damn story...literal to waste of time..if you aren't someone who enjoys drama...do not waste your time on this nonsensical crap!", "The Emperors New Clothes.": "Tarantino as we know has a sick sense of humour, and admittedly making us pay money to sit through that 'so called' movie is a pretty good practical joke and even somewhat artistic in a Banksy kind of way.... Quentin, I solute you but BS must be called, Sir. I'd appreciate a refund and my 2.5 hours back please!Appreciate the stitch up though...", "I was 13 when all this was evolving.": "Yay Quinton. Loved every minute of this movie. Margot Robbie, a fellow Aussie, played Sharon Tate to perfection. I remember Sharon from when I was young and thought she was just the sweetest, kindest, most beautiful person. Leo and Brad were great, as usual but the actor that I loved the most, along side Margot, was Sayuri an American pit bull terrier. In the movie she is named Brandy. Three dogs played her part but she was the main dog-actor. The actors that played Charlie Manson and Squeaky Fromme were spot on. In fact all the actors were Fab! I like the way Quinton was thinking and re-imagining things when he wrote 'Once upon a time...'. I lived it and loved it. Thank you Mr.Tarantino.", "Plods then a Bruce Lee low blow": "I thought wow Leonardo, Brad, Margot and even Al Pachino so many big names which you expect from Tarantino. It kind of goes nowhere and takes a good 45 minutes to introduce all the players.\nThen a huge crime of making Bruce Lee appear overly arrogant and beatable.\nThen it plods some more and you think oh it's done and that was not the best use of my time. Sorry Tarantino I do love most of your films this is not one of them.\nThis is no Kill Bill, Djano Unchained, Pulp Fiction or True Romance epic.\nI've often thought I must watch Jackie Brown again but Once Upon a Time in Hollywood I do not need to see ever again.", "Not a masterpiece": "This film is an interesting exercise. Tarantino imagined a world in which the Manson Family murders were foiled, but much of what goes on in this film is quite random (the eight-year-old girl actor is a good example of what I am talking about). I am also unclear as to why Brad Pitt won an Oscar for his performance, which is a rehash of roles he has played many times (in Snatch, the Ocean's series, etc.). Maybe it was intended as a kind of lifetime achievement award?Some are hailing Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood as a masterpiece, but I believe that they are seeing something which is not here. The various threads are all worth watching individually, but they are not woven together in a satisfying way. I spent most of the film waiting for the Manson family murders, so I suppose that I can say that I was surprised at Tarantino's Horror genre substitution for what transpired in reality.", "Transports you": "You are transported to late sixties and inside the Hollywood world. You see the dichotomy of those working side by side in the industry. It's a true story of realistic friendship in a profession filled with fake relationships. Fascinating screenplay that has you crying and laughing. When it ends you have to blink and give a shake to return to the present because this movie truly transports you.\n( Deep tears of happiness at the end. If only......)", "You have to know story about Manson family to be able to fully understand this movie": "I was completely ignorant what this related to the real life events and a lot of things gone over my head because of that. Wish someone told me that before a went to watch it.", "Another fractured fairytale from Quentin Tarantino.": "At first viewing this film seemed like an enjoyable trip down memory lane that ended up skidding off the end of the road and into the weeds. Then I realised that this story actually felt like more of a companion piece to \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\". Both films resurrect 60's icons in a nearly plotless \"hangout\" movie where we get to spend a lot of time enjoying the company of a group of iconic TV characters (real and invented) and in both cases the low-key story ends up resolving itself in a reinvention of a famous real-life event (Manson murders/Voyager probe launches) In both films the real intention is to enjoy time with the characters while the climactic events serve to give the whole thing a semblance of meaning or depth. Interestingly both films feature a sexy female victim character (Sharon Tate/Ilia) who is the focus of the story and is magically saved by the end of the film. This take gains more creedence when you consider that Tarantino has expressed interest in making his own Star Trek film.\nAddendum: Nov 2019 - to continue the comparison, Leo must be Kirk the old-timer threatened by new younger players. Brad is Spock and like Spock he goes on an extended exploration of enemy territory which would make Charles Manson the equivalent of V'ger?", "Why was this movie made?": "Not every movie has to have motive to be done, I can agree on that. But when you are a respected director, the least you can do is tell a good story and not one that in the end makes everyone go \"Ok, thats it?\"\nSharon is portraited as dumb and futile, her death is not a joke so it can be passed as one. Again, everyone knows Tarantino loves feet, but why the hell are we obligated to watch a two-hour movie of frames of *a lot* o womans feet, thats plain disrespectful.\nThe two reasons I dont give this movie a solid 1 star is because of the well-made job of the Director of Photography, who gave us nice shots of driving in the 70s and Leo and Brad acting, the only part where writing wasnt shallow and plain. Otherwise, this movie is NOT GOOD.", "Gave it a generous 5 total letdown": "Went to this movie today with great anticipation what a letdown sorry Quinton certainly not your best. I really wanted to love it but just a long ok story that really left me saying really?", "Tarantino's confidence shines through": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood with all of it's star-studded cast, production value, and famed auteur director is incredibly arthouse for a blockbuster. As a international viewer outside US, I did not research much into the Sharon Tate murder and the Manson's family gruesome exploits. Hence, going into this movie I had very little idea the contextual setting it was taking place in. I did understand most of the nods and gestures at the timeless actors, places and and world inhabited by the movie.I feel like there are two parts to this film that Tarantino might or might not have wanted to make clear. Firstly would be to make a film about nolstalgia and being outside time. Rick's obsession with him being a \"hasbeen\" resulting in him losing his place in time. The classic soundtrack. The motif of the actors driving against the arrowheads on the road. The long shots of multiple setpieces of old shops lightning up, the drive-in cinema, horseback, hippie culture, the excessive cigarretes. These all paint a incredible and realistic hollywood in the 60s. It's clear that he loves that period, and every reference is implanted with great detail and care.The narrative of the film is also mostly absent, in turn we get multiple disconnected storylines with multiple characters. Which works to produce something remarkably \"slice of life\". It's a different feeling in this movie, clearly different from his other filmography. Which is why I say this is more art film than dramatic blockbuster.Then comes the second part, the wacky, absurd, and violent Tarantino that paints a different message. Scenes cut very abruptly. Many flashbacks, inserts and movie excerpts. Bizzare, akin to going againts film rules. It blurs the line between film and the film world. The scene in which Rick is filming his scene without revealing any of the film equipment can be analyzed just by itself. Yet, I want to place focus on the ending. It's an interesting creative choice by Tarantino to subvert the ending. It created an idealogical and whimsical sequence of events. Personally, the idea of reality vs film projected reality is very clear here. The audiences know the true reality, but can choose to believe in which reality they want to believe in.While there's lots to unpack from everything in this movie. It was hard to say that it was a masterpiece or rivetting. It's entertaining and captivating due to Tarantino's masterful work of dialogue and scene building. But without a clear narrative the film suffers. But I'm sure Tarantino had a lot of fun making this one.", "Worst Tarantino movie ever": "Wt did i just watch? I like Tarantino movie but this is a piece of crap. Dont watch", "What a complete mess.": "My wife and I walked into a half empty cinema expecting a fabulous cinematic extravaganza with Pitt and DiCaprio starring in a Tarantino film. Well by the time the film had passed the 60 minute mark the cinema was now a quarter full. I have never seen people leave a film in such numbers before.\nI know I am not allowed to put spoilers into a review without first warning a potential reader, but there has to a plot that can be spoilt in the first place, and there isn't one. The film was a mess, from start to finish. A self indulgent mess. It has no continuity at all. OK Tarantino's films require a viewer to piece together a complex set of sub plots, that is the only reason I stayed in that cinema was in the hope I was going to slowly put the thing together and be amazed at the writers genius. Ha Ha, the only genius was my wife because she fell asleep after 20 minutes and awoke 2 hours later refreshed.\nThe dog in the film was brilliant, it acted superbly. Pitt has moments that were good, DiCaprio - I could not make head or tail out of what he was supposed to be, or what film he was in, or what film I was watching. If you are confused by that then you are one step ahead of me.\nPlease go and see this film and you too can suffer the same dreadful boring load of rubbish that we endured tonight.", "What a great job !": "I loved it ! The places, the acting, the non story telling and still very catchy! Brad pitt did a perfect acting job in this movie ! The end is well.. just watch this masterpiece !", "Loved the dog!": "I gave the dog three stars. The rest was really loooong and booooring!", "2 and a half hours never went by so quickly": "Always a sign of a good movie. I was pleasantly surprised that I never once wondered how much time had passed and how much time until the end ? Good acting all around and just enough stuff going on to keep it ticking over. Not a huge Tarantino fan but it's the closest to an outright comedy I've seen him do. I laughed out loud at at least 4 scenes - and I've seen so called comedies that made me laugh less.The retro feel is very well done - I was 4 when this movie was set but still chuckled seeing gadgets from my early days pop up.The only gripe I have - how the f* is Brad Pitt able to make a left turn in Los Angeles ? Can't happen these days !!", "Slow and rambling": "Did someone actually get paid to edit this film? You'd never know it. At 2 hours and 41 minutes, it moves slower than molasses with most scenes badly in need of trimming, while others could have been cut altogether. The finale is exciting, but it should have come an hour earlier.", "Worst film ever": "This is the worst film I've ever watched in my entire life. I love films that are deep or artsy, or even movies that require to think. This has no deep meaning, not entertaining, boring etc etc. I rather watch a really bad acting movie that is rated for 3/10 than this over hyped movie by a famous producer and famous actors. I love the actors so much but I still can't even enjoy it in the slightest. No plot, no entertaining value, nothing. Nada. I've never browse my phone in a cinema but I did it with this movie!", "Masterful!": "Masterful film-making; very good story-telling; wonderful acting. On the one hand, it's a Western (of sorts); and on the other hand, as the title suggests, it's a fairy tale (of sorts). The three main leads are terrific. Tarantino's eye for detail is superb. If you enjoy watching a master film-maker take his time to tell a story, . . . that is, if you love cinema, you will not be disappointed with this film. If you know your Hollywood history, the film is wonderfully immersive and will take you back to another time and place. If you don't know your Hollywood history, then please do just a little bit of homework before you buy a ticket. One of the best movies I've seen so far this year; but, admittedly, it probably won't be to everyone's taste.", "great entertainment": "\"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" is the latest movie of director Quentin Tarantino. As expected, he takes no account of his audience and does whatever he wants. The movie contains many allusions that you don't necessarily understand if you haven't prepared for this movie. But don't worry, the movie is still a lot of fun!\nThe main actors also perform brilliantly especially Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.\nAlthough the film does not meet the expectations but it is surprising and unpredictable. Another masterpiece of Tarantino!", "A weird ride.": "This was my first Tarantino feature in a theater, and I was hugely excited because of that. I find it impossible to rank his films because I love all of them so much, especially Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. I had some expectations from a QT movie.What followed next was the most self-indulgent QT has ever been in his career. It's literally a movie about a normal day in a struggling actor's career, with a stunt double and a stunning actress as a next-door neighbor. Lots of 60s kitsch that helped make the movie, dialogue that'll make you laugh riotedly, and good performances all round.However, it felt underwhelming. Maybe it's possible because of the marketing or what, but I didn't feel that same thrill I felt in most of his other movies. I like the subtle referential style he adopts in this movie, where he references his own filmography, or that of the old times. But, it feels too slow. Too much driving, for one.However, I still give it a high rating because of how entertaining it proves to be. The final 30 minutes are full-blown Tarantino that we deserved. One could say it was worth the build-up, and it is a happy ending. There's some great, memorable scenes as well, most notably the one between Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth who's Brad Pitt's character. It also has everything else essential to a QT movie - killer (very killer, indeed) soundtrack, snappy dialogue, faithfulness to the period.It's not QT's best, but it is his most experimental and self-indulgent. It's also a weirdly enjoyable ride, and doesn't feel boring for too long. It's not an instant classic, but it's a ride you should sign up for.", "Tumult of emotions": "I can't believe that I cried at the end. For lives that were never lived.", "Tarantino's alternate reality of what happened on Cielo Drive": "It's very nice to watch DiCaprio, Pitt and Pacino in a single film. The ending is a very satisfying alternate reality for the people who got hurt by those worthless freaks in that year. I was able to immerse in every single scene. Rick (DiCaprio) is an aging actor and Cliff (Brad Pitt) is is his stunt double. Rick is the neighbor of Sharon Tate and his husband Polanski. Cliff's driving him around and Rick is trying to deal with the fact that he's a washed out actor and trying new films. The scene where he had a mental breakdown on the set in his trailer and then giving a great performance with that little girl as the bad guy was amazing. Sharon was enjoying her life to the fullest with parties in the playboy mansion, watching himself in the theater and picking up hitchhiking hippies. I also liked watching Cliff the wife killer fighting Bruce Lee on the set and fired from his job. Cliff also picked up a Manson girl and took him to their place Spahn Ranch. It was really creepy the girls and the owner of the ranch who let them live there. Cliff beat the guy who bursted his tire until he agreed to changed it. Then the freaks broke into the house of rick instead of Sharon. Rick, Cliff, Brandy and Rick's Italian wife killed them all. It was so satisfying to watch and it reminded me of the ending of Inglourious Basterds. The most freaky freak of all was torched by a flamethrower in the pool by Rick. That was an iconic scene. And then Sharon invited him to have a drink with them. Tarantino's alternate realities feel so good.", "Acting and Cinematography Great! But...": "I wonder when people will stop heaping praise upon QT and other similar directors when their efforts are less than stellar.It's like \"hey this is a QT movie so we're required by Hollywood law to love it and consider it one of the best films ever made.\"Instead, we're left wondering what the hell we just watched. No discernible plot, no direction, just a series of scenes strung together.Both Di Caprio and Pitt offer excellent performances and steak the show. From what I'm not sure, but they had a great screen presence together. That was the only highlight of this mess.", "Technically well made movie": "Instead of creating a structured narrative, Tarantino focuses most of the film's 161 minute running time on just hanging out with the characters.Brad Pitt is without a doubt the best thing about this movie. This was his best performance in a long time. In considering the character's attitude and history, he's kind of a jerk who should be avoided. But somehow to me he comes across as a likable jerk. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is probably the thing that let disappoints the most in this film. Leo was good; but certainly paling in comparison to his abovementioned co-star. Part of this is on him. Part of the problem however is that large chunks of the film's second act (where we spend a lot of time meandering with Leo) was genuinely boring; and blame for that has to be placed on Tarantino. Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate, as it turns out Tate's role in this film is actually quite limited. Robbie does get a reasonable amount of screen time. Given how talented Robbie is as an actress is a shame that he didn't give her more to do. Being a Tarantino movie - most of his movies the technical aspects are usually superb - and this is no exception. The cinematography, production design, costumes and soundtrack are all incredible. Being a Tarantino movie of course there was going to be some sort of controversy. There are a couple of scenes which have and will divide audiences. One scene comes towards the end of the film. It's violent with elements of dark humour - not something that will surprise Tarantino fans.On the whole, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is not one of Tarantino's finest works. At times this film could be seen as self-indulgent and aimless. It's also way too long. That said, the film is supported with strong performances, awesome soundtrack and overall superb technical elements.", "Adding to the legacy": "This film resembles pulp fiction in my opinion. See for yourself and I believe you will see the similirarities.", "A full helping of Tarantino": "This is a late 60's-70's period piece that is very Tarantino-like in that there's a lot going on at once. It felt disjointed at first but you know he'll bring it all together somehow. You may think, \"what is he possibly going to do with this?\" There are plenty of scenes where you feel anxious, also very Tarantino-like.\nPitt and DiCaprio are excellent in their roles and play off each other marvelously. There are lots of star cameos to make appearances which just adds to the enjoyment.", "More than just a movie": "This is my first ever review on IMDB, which was prompted, in part, by the sheer volume of negativity which this movie has received.To begin: I am a fan of QT and my partner is not; so much so that she even hated Pulp Fiction. However, I sold Once Upon A Time to her on the basis of the interesting timeline crossover with the Manson murders and the fact that Timothy Olyphant had a cameo in it.To put it simply; we both absolutely loved it! From the incredible detail of late 60s LA, through the fantastic on-set homages to 50s/60s Westerns, the creepy hippy cult all the way to the immensely satisfying ending. Yes it was slow, but not one moment was wasted. What all the naysayers are missing is that the scant plot was secondary to the mood, the cinematography and the wonderful performances.Don't get me wrong, I pay plenty to see blockbuster films, e.g. F&F, Marvel, MI, Star Wars/Trek, but they are an of-the-moment experience; a pleasure soon forgotten.Four days after seeing it Once Upon A Time... , it is still fresh in my mind; the imagery; the cultural references; the characters; but most of all, the wonderful twist of \"what-if?\" that QT's imagination has thrown at us.", "What Was All The Hype About?": "This was a very disappointing film, boring, lots of one way dialogue in the many scenes of Leonardo de Caprio in his unrewarding roles as a failing actor, although his acting in that role itself was exceptional. The plot was obscure, and had such little impact it was a struggle to keep awake. Margo Robbie's acting consisted of flashing her mega watt smile continuously but really limited her ability as the fine actress she is. On leaving the theatre, I could only muse on the three hours I wouldn't be able to get back.", "Be Patient": "This movie isn't perfect, but it's by no means bad.A lot of the critical reviewers are correct: this movie doesn't have much of a plot. It's a major slow burn if ever there was one. It's historically inaccurate. It's got a fair amount of Terantino's trademark foot shots. It probably would've been tossed out had the script been submitted by anyone other than Tarantino. All true.The movie isn't supposed to be a factually accurate portrayal of the Sharon Tate murders, however. It's been billed as a fantasy, hence the \"Once Upon a Time\" in the title. It's a long movie that forces the audience to come along for a ride without a lot of rhyme or reason, and that's perhaps one of its greatest factors. It's a rambling love letter to the films and aesthetics of the 60's for the most part. It requires patience on the part of the viewer to hear Tarantino out before casting judgments.\nDespite the lack of a concise plot, I can't honestly say there was any point in the movie where I was genuinely bored. There's something so compelling about the way Quentin Terantino tells a story that never fails to captivate from one shot to the next.\nThe payoff of the film is pretty great, and it makes it worth sitting through the rest of the movie. It ends with a more traditional Terantino style that is satisfying to watch.The cast all did a fantastic job with this movie as well.Please hang in there and give this one a shot. It's well worth the time.", "Only for those who love a good ol' fashion slice-o'-life flick.": "Not at all what I was expecting but I loved it. One of the best final acts I've seen in a long, long time.", "I lived 1969 as a teen": "I know the entire story of Cielo Drive. Also read Helter Skelter and saw the movie (guy that played Manson was outstanding). Even with all that knowledge at hand I walked out on this boring film. And I've always enjoyed Tarantino's films before. This one just CRAWLS along. Reminded me of trying to read The Dome. Love Stephen King but that one didn't grab me.", "Depends on your point of reference": "If you love retro type movies and interested in this period or want to look back at it this is the movie for you. As far as I'm concerned Brad Pitt had the best role.", "Some people don't get it": "I have been seeing a lot of people bashing this movie for the plot or the ending being the only good part, but they just must of missed the point.This film is all about the struggles of Hollywood in the late 60's and how people had to deal with the rise and fall of stardom. While i did feel Leo's character was a bit dry, Brad Pitt made up for it. One of the best roles I've seen him in in along time and he made the film well worth it.As for the ending I have heard people say \"There was not point\" or \"Why didn't they explain what happened after he went to get drinks with Stone.\" The whole point of the ending was that it's not real, it's an alternate reality and it leaves the viewers up to decide the rest. Up until that point everything happening around Leo and Pitt was \"true\", while after the events when they killed those Manson couldn't be written because it never happened.People need to be more perceptive, great film, well worth the watch.", "Easily his worst film": "I'm a big fan of Tarantino films but seriously, this is a real crap. It's boring, you don't get invested in the characters, it wanders aimlessly all over the place, and the end is just dumb. If I could give this a zero I would. I made the mistake of buying it on DVD. Don't make the same mistake I did.", "This film will literally take you to the 60s": "Was late to the party on this one, but did rewatch it afew times, its that good.So many great actors, so much great acting, this is an A grade movie through and through, they spared no expense. Yes we all know how dazzling Margot Robbie is, but she needs to do more than just stand around looking pretty, but she does that well.Everything from the sets, to the scenes, the costumes, the makeup, the locations, the vehicles, just breathtakingly amazing.Story is ok here, not amazing but doable. But the dialogue, the energy, is truly hard to beat. No 1000IQ-everyone-is-a-comedian-competing-for-most-oxygen-used here, just normal people conversations.But the biggest thing, oh is that 60s energy. This movie shows that if you put the effort in, and have the budget, you can truly create the most amazing and genuine vibe, which is what has happened here. Every little detail has been gone over with a fine tooth comb, youre basically in the 60s here.The pacing and length is relaxed, not slow but relaxed. It definitely chugs along at a 60s pace. You cant fault the length, as every second is just more great cinema.If youre looking for the best, most spectacular thing hollywood has produced in a while, this is it. You also dont have to be a flowerchild to enjoy this one, im not, as everything is just done so well, you cant help but be mesmerized.", "feet-filled, boring, and borderline incomprehensible movie": "I really really wanted to like this, I'm so sad that i couldn't. I love Tarantino, I love westerns, I love the 60s. So this movie would be perfect for me right??? My main problem with this movie is that it's foundation is built on actual events and people, but never explains that it is an interpretation of those events.\nI'm fine with a fictional happy ending to what is a real-life tragedy but with no explanation I spent the whole movie confused as to what the premise actually was and why we were focusing on these two fictional characters that it ruined the whole movie for me. Why would I ever see a movie that I can't figure out what the premise was until the movie ends??\n(((You also have to have prior knowledge on the real life events or you'll be twice as confused as I was.)))I purposely don't watch trailers or read about movies because I want to see how well the movie can tell me the story on its own. This movie can't.\nThe plot is non-existent and there's no tension. It's just two characters who don't have any development doing boring time filling stuff for two long acts then it finally picks up in the third act then it just ends suddenly and you go \"wait why was I sitting here for nearly three hours?\". I love long mundane scenes, but when there isn't a plot it's just painful and boring. And if the five minutes of action makes up for the 160 minutes of nothing... i mean good for you but it doesn't cut it for me.Also, the feet stuff was really really overboard in this movie..... more than all his others. It just took me out of a movie I was already struggling so hard to stay engaged with.", "Definitely interesting but not Oscar worthy": "Most Quentin movies are interesting and unique. This one goes all over the place, with minimal plot. So much controversy with real life people, but when you look at the title, which includes Once Upon a Time, it really shouldn't be taken too seriously. Always a nice build up to the end, but not my favourite QT movie.", "Hmmmmmm": "Great cast good acting. But. Was that it, for the director and cast I should have been amazing. Alas, talk about watching paint dry. But then the ending brilliant. It was worth the cinema entrance for the ending, but that's it. It's on the same line to the hateful eight. Slow slow bam!!!.

It's far lower from Pulp Fiction in this aspect.\nFinally, I also deduct 2 more point for Bruce Lee, a shame is done to a legendary figure.", "Awesome movie!": "The Movie was amazing. Great acting from both Leo and Brad. The movie was a bit long and if you're not aware of the actual story of what happened with Polanski, Tate etc this movie will not have the same impact.

Not even alittle bit enjoyable!!", "not the best tarantino film": "And i'm not saying it because its a dark comedy and not in line with his others. It was an ambitious film whose lenght does not take away from it at all. Rather its the plot that just lakes something. The three main leads all did great and I always like seeing them in films. And lets not forget dicarprio wilding a flame thrower now thats what I want to see more of. I did like this alternate universe esque film with they characters being in different year. Robbie playing sharon tate I thought was a good likeness and there were some fun bits there and there. The rest of the cast were pretty good also. Just overall I felt it lacked something, but that doesn't mean the films bad. If you like it then thats good.", "Tarantino? What have you done?": "I'm a huge fan of Tarantino, and also the amazing actors in the movie. But seriously, what is this movie about? I was so excited to watch it, but honestly it was a huge let down maybe because I was expecting the best of the best.Overall it wasn't that bad, but it's definitely one of the not good movies on Tarantino's resume.", "Utter Garbage": "This is one of, if not THE worst film i've ever seen! How on earth anyone can give more than one star is an absolute mystery!! Someone has said in one review the mid point of the film is where the typical Tarantino kicks in, er no, its ten minutes from the end and wading through two hours and twenty minutes of uneventful krud is not worth the anti climax that awaits the viewer! Shameful!! #losttheplot", "A fun ride": "Obviously the ones giving this film 1 star are being silly and/or have an axe to grind. It's a clever film, well worth watching and Pitt, Robbie and DiCaprio are outstanding.", "This very good movie about being movie stars tin holly wood": "This very good movie about how you can be a stunt man and actor in hollywood and meet many interesting poeple there. I like this movie because sometimes you are seeing them making the movie with the cameras which you can see them in the movie. Is very good idea, you dont see people making movies inside the movie very much.Matt damon is quite good actor in this one, he has mustache and is mostly a cowboy, but sometimes he is regular guy who is angery and sad very much. in america, it making you think that is very possible to be cowboy during normal day and then at night time you get to float around in swimming pool.Also in this movie is blond girl who like to go to the movie and watch movies. She walk around town and like dancing. Also it has a stuntman in it who is very good at punching people. The stuntman meet some strange people in dessert and then it get him in trouble, because they come and looking for him.But matt damons caracter is very drunk and tell them to leave and anyway, they do not. But the stuntman is very very violent and he kills them. He go off to hospital and the cowboy goes to neighbors, I think to talk about what happened, and that is the end. It is very interesting how in american movies they like to kill each other and then go on with life normal like it is normally.You will like this movie if you like movies about cowboys and group of friends who living in hollywood and go to parties and into dessert together. In hollywood, everything is fun and normal and easy, and is possible if someone tries to kill you, you can kill them, and then go to your neighbors and hang out with them when you are finished. I think it is called once upon a time in hollywood because this cannot happen more times than that.", "Class movie": "The movie takes its time to get to the juicy part but if you follow through to the end, you are not disappointed!!!To sum up, I was wedged between my wife and my friend and at one stage all three of us were laughing with tears coming out of our eyes!", "Tarantino's \"American Graffiti\"": "Being a fan of Tarantino, my expectation for this film was very high-considering this might be the filmmaker's last directorial outing. Having watched it a couple of weeks ago at the cinema, I enjoyed it. Did it exceed expectations? Not really. Is this Tarantino's best work? Not at all. As many film reviewers have wrote, this is Tarantino's love letter to the 1960's Hollywood. The visuals, down to the small details was brilliantly done. The soundtrack is just as great, like most of Tarantino's work. The performances were all wonderful (including the controversial Bruce Lee and Sharon Tate portrayals). The story moves at a relatively slow pace, following the vignette-style of \"American Graffiti\". There's less violence by Tarantino standards-that is until the last thirty minutes of the film. The satisfyingly gruesome climax was executed very well, and definitely worth the long running time. For audiences that are not familiar with the historical background and context, I suggest you research it before watching the film because the climax won't be as satisfying. \"Once Upon a Time\" is Tarantino's \"American Graffiti\"-a story that takes place in a transitional phase in history, but served with the right amount of cathartic violence that will be sorely missed from audiences worldwide if this great filmmaker really is going to retire.", "Way too long!": "I agree with other reviewers that the first couple of hours was mainly a 60's nostalgia fest that dragged. The story could have been condensed into 90 mins and would have been the better for it.", "Ode to old hollywood concerning today's change of the movie experience without an actual plot": "Very mild spoilers ahead\n....\nLet me preface this review by saying that some Tarantino movies belong on my all time list (pulp Fiction, inglorious basterds, kill bill) and some just weren't my cup of tea (death proof, django unchained).This movie mostly follows a soon to be a has been actor during a day of his life with his stuntman in an era where the people stopped going to the theaters and started watching TV instead. A shift occurred back then just like today with streaming services.Tarantino reminisces through DiCaprio's character his issues of how the industry is changing and how he himself is now almost at the end of his journey.So, the allegory of the movie seems clear. The dialogue is great. Camera work and direction are superb - especially when Brad Pitt visits the desert. The acting is top notch.However, even though there is a plot to follow with a substantial climax, the movie itself didn't get anywhere for me. The grand finale was, though very entertaining, for me at least, quite meaningless considering the story of the two main characters. Instead it feels more like a movie intended for Quentin himself. Everything he did in this movie hes done already in a movie before (actors, locations, camera angles).This movie is a nice loveletter to Hollywood and is supposed to sum up Tarantino's career. However, it just ended nowhere and therefore is, I guess, only intended for the people in and around Hollywood.", "Another frustrating Tarantino entry": "Following the frustrating entry to Tarantino's career that was Hateful Eight, the living legend is back with yet another divisive and controversial flick to add to his discography, while carrying over many of the flaws seen with his aforementioned previous film.An obvious flaw is the length. Even to the most devoted Tarantino fans, it's undeniable that he seems to be getting carried away with his writing following his label as one of the greatest directors of our generation. With now 9 films under his belt, Tarantino seems to have no concept of when to pull back on the running times of his films anymore - with his last 3 films (including this one) being his longest films to date. Whereas with Django unchained it's length was justified, with his previous two entries, the plots are simply far too simplistic to justify nearly 3 hour run times.Once Upon A Time in Hollywood feels like a spiritual successor to Pulp Fiction, where it's a seemingly plotless film driven by a talented cast, except this time without Tarantino bothering to write anything - a painful amount of this movie feels like it was dedicated to just watching our characters walk or drive around with very little happening - The most frustrating example of which is Margot Robbie's character, who only exists to walk around, speak for once scene, then provide the fake-out ending similar to the one seen in Inglorious Basterds. Only in Inglorious Basterds, the ending was earned after the whole film was building to it, whereas here, the film generally meanders for 2 hours and 20 minutes, with Tarantino abandoning his use of encapsulating dialogue (which made Hateful Eight bareable), only for a final 20 minutes that rushes to an out of nowhere conclusion.Whats the most annoying is that when the regular Tarantino-isms are at play, the film can be tense, emotional, and satisfying, but far too much of the film is spent meandering for these moments to feel gratifying, and now these tropes are starting to come off as a punchline, with the numerous shots of feet, and Tarantino literally cutting through a conversation with Dicaprio and Olyphant, as if to show awareness of how his dialogue scenes can drag.The legendary director is still in there, it just requires a stripped back runtime and more time spent with the films characters to feel truly gratifying again.", "Visually beautiful and stunning...": "This is a beautifully filmed homage to old Hollywood films. Visually stunning and exquisitely filmed, however, it was a very long movie almost bereft of a plot. It all came together in the end but it was 2 hours and 42 minutes where all the action takes place in the last 20 minutes. Terantino definitely pays homage to Hitchcock with his colorful street shots and background sounds. The sets were beautifully constructed and you definitely felt the atmosphere involved in making movies and tv shows. I liked this, don't get me wrong but it needed more of a plot and could have been about an hour shorter.", "A long boring mess only saved by Di Caprio": "If you love 69-70s nostalgia; this movie might be for you but you will need to check some of history inadequacies Tarantino fancies so much (is Sharon Tate is not killed in this movie).\nAside from the nostalgia not really much happens. There is a big story about a fading TV actor (Di Caprio deserving another Oscar) even that is too long. The rest are pretty much random scenes of something bigger that seem to be left in the cutting floor (cannot imagine how much because the movies is almost 3 hours long).\nTarantino is able to recruit outstanding actors; there is no way to explaiin Di Caprio, Brad Pitt (good too but with an underwritten character), Al Pacino (two scenes mostly a cameo),Margot Robbie; completely underused and a few other others that are barely seen in one or two scenes without any connection with the rest of the movie.\nMy belief is that Tarantino made a very long movie that could not be released completely for simply commercial reasons and did not has enough violence to justify a two parts as KILL BILL.\nTo be sincere this is the kind of movie would not released with other actors and directors.\nIn brief; do not lose your time. Wait for the directors cut or full version; but this one is a waste of almost three hours without nothing funny unless you were born in that decade.", "no spoilers": "Boring boring boring even worse that the hateful eight. what has happened to tarantino.", "Comforting, beautiful picture": "I am so happy that this fairytale is told. It is like a grand apologize to Sharon Tate and her friends from all of us. Apologize against all disgusting in homo sapiens.\nCast and everything in this movie is professional if not perfect.", "Misunderstood by some.": "Incredibly acted, beautifully shot and masterfully put together. The people going off about how this was a waste of time and that it \"doesn't even show the Manson family murders\" are entirely missing the point here. QT has delivered once more with an absolutely masterpiece of a movie. I couldn't recommend this more to the cinema lover. As they are saying, \"Go and see it, and then go and see it again!\"", "Beautiful film, about on par with Inglorious Bastards": "I was a little nervous going in to this movie. I am a HUGE QT fan and love all his work (yes, even Death Proof) and had heard rather mixed reviews for this movie. I have a tendency to get a little restless when watching a movie more than 2 and a half hours yet this movie kept me engaged from start to finish. Brad Pitt and Leo have undeniable chemistry whether it's during the endearing moments or the comedic moments (there are plenty In this film). The dialogue is quick, sharp, hilarious and beautifully written, much like all of Quentin's films. The set is astonishingly accurate for the time period it is set in and really transports you back to a time where Hollywood was transitioning into a dark period of runaways and drug addicts. This movie as a whole is Tarantino's least violent since Jackie Brown; however when the violence erupts, it's get pretty gruesome. This movie was rather weird, even for Tarantino as it shows for long periods at a time movies being filmed inside of movies. Some less important plot lines In the film are a little useless; however at no point did I feel it made the movie worst. With great performance, set design, script and premise, Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood! Is a must see for any movie lover or Tarantino fa .", "Tarantino is the master, get over it!": "After reading some very harsh reviews for this movie I was wondering if I finally was going to witness a bad movie from Quentin Tarantino? After watching it I can only conclude this will never happen. Everything Quentin Tarantino does is just sublime. He's definitely my favorite movie director of all time. I don't get why anybody would even think this is a bad movie. Normally I don't like long movies but Quentin Tarantino manages to get away with it, time after time, and that's just because his movies are entertaining from the first till the last second. Okay you have to wait a long time before everything is going berzerk like only QT can do it but that's just suspense building, very clever if you ask me. The \"slow\" part of the movie, some say for two hours, was also great to watch, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt acting at their best. In the beginning of Leonardo DiCaprio's career a lot of people thought he was average but I think he proved everybody wrong by now as to me he's one of the better actors from the last decades. Brad Pitt plays his usual self, what a great actor he is as well. Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood is another movie to keep in a collection, another Tarantino hit, and this despite what the bad reviewers are trying to make you believe.", "A movie like no other": "Wow...I was not expecting that..this movie is an absolute cinematic masterpiece...great intriguing stories all intertwined, part fact, part fiction, and this movie is cool as a cucumber...this was acting of the highest caliber (made, no doubt, easier by the exemplary writing of QT (a genius by the way)...Leo, Brad, Margot and all the supporting cast (including Brad's trusty hound) were so believable and engrossing that I didn't even realise I'd been watching a movie for 2 hours 41 minutes!If you love Cinema, you have to watch this movie and lose yourself in the story...thank you Mr Tarrantino....we have been so short of true classic movies of late...can't wait for the 10th film...", "Review QT": "Tarantino completes his Western trilogy in Beverly hills and not in Pine hills. Possibly the least violent (the film has no scenes that can be classified as violent) of all his movies, Tarantino also does not engage in any famous teasing, leaving everything to tone to create his mosaic. Adapting to an audience that is learning about him, Tarantino uses vivid colours and strong sound to make his impact. This film has been favourably received and he should be grateful for that, in times when rotten tomatoes grow easily.\nClearly, reminiscing on 60's California is not enough and will not linger on for the duration of 2: 30 hours, enter Margot Robbie who fails in her appearance of a sweet distraction. The film passes as the dynamic duo of Brad and Leo work their way through an unfriendly and smarter-than-thou neighbourhood with street smartness that resembles Eastwood and Wallach in the older movies. One can feel the strong climax coming up as this pace makes things quite conspicuous.\nLeonardo Di Caprio deserves a special mention for using his experience as an actor in helping Tarantino push this one through. I rate this as an 8.PS: A warning and call to all is said here to bring an end to the 'Allegory Mania' that is just not quitting Hollywood right now. This social disease comes from a silly middle class sitting out there and can percolate easily into the professional classes. Almost every scene of the film can be traced to an obvious derivation with ease. This must stop or the films may end up as derived cinema. At one point, it almost felt as if my own mundane life was being singularly captured on film.", "Never wanted to walk out of a film before": "Honestly this film is so boring, I should of got up and walked out with the rest of the people half way through this absolute drain of a movie, wasn't worth sitting through 2 hours of nothing for 10 min of over the top violence, must of laughed about twice through the whole film! An angry birds film is out go see that, will be more enjoyable", "I paid for a blockbuster, I got a cheap western": "\"Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood\" is a 2019 crime drama directed by Quentin Tarantino starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. After learning this film received a seven minute standing ovation at the premiere in Cannes I was even more pumped for this film. Over a year ago, when the first images were released, I was so excited I couldn't even put it in words. I mean, Pitt and DiCaprio, both exceptionally gifted actors leading a star-studded cast of beloved legends as well as promising newcomers, even in the smallest role. All of them directed by Tarantino. What could go wrong then? Tragically, so much. The biggest flaw of this film definitely is it's run time of almost three hours. In the most instances it was extremely boring and almost made me fall asleep in multiple occasions. Mostly because the \"movie-in-movie\" scenes were absolute irrelevant. It might be excellently acted by DiCaprio and Co., but only because of the actors ability. It's like he played the phone book to me: It would definitely be great judging by how he does it, but after all it would still be the freakin phone book. Forty percent of the plot consists of cheesy western scenes - was this really necessary? It felt like an uninteresting Making Of of a cheap western and not like a Tarantino blockbuster. Additionally, the plot had zero substance and didn't even build up any suspense. Just take a look at the Spahn Ranch scene. I expected something horrifying, a conclusion to the mystery, but ultimately it was just as the characters said. What was the purpose of it? I was sitting there uncomfortably and wondered when the pure boredom would finally end. It might be beautifully shot and visually captured the essence of the 1960s, but that's all, the story didn't offer any interesting turns at all, neither do the characters show any development in the end. Next to this, what's the point of casting actors who accurately look like their real life counterparts just to have them show up only as extended cameos? Mostly insulting was the appearance of Bruce Lee. Mike Moh might have nailed the mimic and look, but the way his character is depicted is nothing but a shame. Everyone else looked perfect and showed the original characteristics, why was Lee an arrogant and cocky prick? It's both an insult towards him as a human being and the Eastern film industry itself. Also, what's the point of casting accurate actors just to let them appear for no longer than a few minutes? After the painful first two and a half hours of visually appealing nonsense the final scenes finally showed at least some Tarantino flair. The brutal and gruesome violence is the only proof for the director's origins in the art house genre and even reminded me of \"Reservoir Dogs\" for a few seconds. That's the only point I've thoroughly enjoyed as it showed the usual cinematic output of QT. The alternative reality depicted in this film is a well written conclusion and was the only acceptable way to depict these tragic events. It treats the legacy of Sharon Tate with immense respect and I liked that a lot. But as the credits rolled I realized that her complete character arc was totally irrelevant for the plot and only there to lure us cinema goers. It sad to see that all the big names only function as a bait for the audience and it was all about the money. The director himself called this a love letter to Hollywood. To me, it feels more like the work of a man that forgot about his cinematic roots and traded his personal beliefs and edgy directorial style for lots of money and the acceptance of the mainstream audience and critics. One could already feel that he isn't able to keep up with the quality anymore in \"The Hateful Eight\", but compared to this mess it's another \"Pulp Fiction\". All in all, this film is a complete disaster that generated so much hype and delivered so poorly. It's a cinematic mess with such a promising premise, but such a catastrophic execution. Although it stars many of my favourite actors and actresses to date, the sloppy writing prevents it from being an enjoyable experience. In the end, it's the biggest disappointment of the year that miserably failed my expectations. A wasted opportunity, overrated and nonsensical, the highly acclaimed Quentin Tarantino lost his credibility with. Only in the end it shows a small light of what has been years ago, overall it's absolutely forgettable. Sad but true, he just isn't able to make great films anymore. I should have spent my money on something else. Never been so much disappointed after visiting the cinema...", "Quentin Tarantino does it again.": "I never find enough words to describe how much Quentin's films influence me. Without a doubt he is my all time favorite director and within my highlighted screenwriters. From first to last, every moment of the film is worth watching. Although it may seem lenghty, one must understand, portraying a precise time and place of history accurately takes time. Quentin's work is absolutely precious, the script is wonderful. Characters, both previously existent and non, are amazing. I believe Brad Pitt brings the best performance on the film. Robbie and DiCaprio are pretty good, and some others such as Emile Hirsch and Margaret Qualley as well. The score is magnificent and it goes in line with all previous scores in Tarantino's work. Music truly is a spot of perfection on every of his films. It's driven throughout a radio station as medium and I must say, it works greatly. Direction is awesome, great aerial shots and scenes are'nt able to be easily predicted thanks to the way Quentin approached the story. It's another masterpiece to add to the collection, and not at all, a filler. It really is'nt for anyone though. If you expect a savage battle of blood then it won't live up to your hopes. This is the most \"peaceful\" of his films, although the dark humor, is still very present. Only disappointments come from the fact that amazing actors such as Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Bruce Dern and Dakota Fanning have really small amounts of screen time. Nevertheless, they are'nt cornestones to the story, but using great talents for really short periods of time is a price that only mogul's such as Quentin can afford. Not his best film, but surely, one of them. 9/10.", "What a great movie!!!": "I live Tarantino's movies...this movie is great, funny, brutal...exactly, what I was expecting from Tarantino...wait till the end, and you will laugh as crazy", "Tarantino at his most meta": "Great film but...\nFeet feet, \u00f0\u0178\u017d\u00b6 feet feet feet, feet feet, feet feet feet, feet feet, feet feet.", "\"I Hired You To Be An Actor\"": "It's a fairytale after all so why shouldn't it be a romanticised version of Hollywood with the time period been seen through rose tinted glasses?

All the way down to the overblown run time.", "QT - If I was to give you script notes.": "Quentin, I love what you have done here. This script sings a love for Hollywood that leaps off the page. I like that you're changing history again and I think that this mixed genre thing you've got going on could work really well.I do have some issues however.One of the things I look forward to in your screenplays are the hidden coincidental connections and clever foreshadowing of events to come. e.g - \"Garcon coffee!\" or \"Pai Mei taught you the five point palm exploding heart technique?\"I know you really wanted to do 'a day in the life' of these characters, but the lack of connections between these stories makes for some uninteresting set-ups that never quite pay off.1. Steve McQueen sets up the relationship between Jay Sebring and Roman Polanski, but we never see or hear from him again.2. Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth fight, but we don't get a resolution?3. If the Manson Family gets killed before they murder anyone, Charles Manson will never be implicated in the murder and he will still be out there.4. Jay Sebring is clearly trying to get back with Sharon and Roman is cool with him hanging around all the time?5. The Western TV show with Rick was cool, but he goes and acts in a Sergio Corbucci film we never see?Now, I'm no Oscar winning writer, so take this with a grain of pepper...What if you scrap the TV Western scene and convert it to a sequence in Italy showing Rick working with Sergio Corbucci on Nebraska Jim.\nNebraska Jim is a success and when Rick comes back on a high, he finds an invite in the mail to Sharon Tate's party.Rick and Cliff Booth head to the party, and as they walk up to the gate, Bruce Lee and Steve McQueen pull up in a red Ferrari (I am sure you know this, but they were good friends in real life. Bruce was his trainer and Steve was an accomplished martial artist). Bruce and Cliff have words before they speed off up the driveway and into the party.At the party Jay Sebring spots Rick and they have that interaction you wrote at the end where they talk about his body of work, showing Jays appreciation for Rick as an actor. Sharing their mutual love of pop culture, Cliff, Rick and Jay become friends and make some drinks together.Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee chat to Sharon Tate when Roman Polanski comes bursting in pissed at Jay for trying to steal his pregnant wife.Outside the Manson family members (Tex, Pussy, Sadie, Patricia and Linda Kasabian) pull up with Charlie in the driver's seat. They all smoke acid dipped cigarettes (except Charlie, who pretends to).Charlie runs them through his plan once again, making sure everyone knows what they have to do. They get out of the car and Linda Kasabian has second thoughts. She makes a run for it, leaving them with a part of the plan missing - Charlie now has to go in with them.Jay and Roman are about to get physical. Rick and Cliff stand on the side of Jay, and Steve and Bruce side with Roman.It's about to get nasty when Sharon's stands in the middle trying to break them apart. They start to fight, Sharon's water breaks and she goes into labor.BANG! A gun fires in the air and five Manson family members (Including Charlie - who is holding the gun) walk into the party.Charlie gives one of your famous monologues about his distaste for the entertainment industry, and the Mexican stand-off begins.In an awesome Kill-Bill-esk kung fu fight, Bruce, Steve, Rick and Cliff take down all the Manson family members.Only Charlie remains. He's had the gun the whole time, but has shown his true colors and been too afraid to use it.Bruce, Rick, Cliff and Steve all begin to converge on Charlie. He who knows he's done for, so he turns the gun on himself and pulls the trigger - CLICK! he's out of bullets.In a Death-Proof-esk ending, Cliff, Rick, Bruce and Steve take him to pieces.Sharon gives birth, and Roman and Jay make up.In a post credits scene (because they're all the rage these days) we see Rick, Cliff, Steve and Bruce working together on Game of Death - The movie Bruce Lee never finished.Just a suggestion.Hope it goes well for you.Peace.", "tarantino at his best": "Watched this movie today and it was amazing every set is so carefully put together and you can really tell so much effort went in to this movie and everyone making it had a great time would 100% reccomend", "Wait for a director cut": "This was soo bad. I persisted through the three hours of this unlike half the audience who just walked out. It wasn't that bad, there are a few gems like Caprio acting within acting which made me sit up.It is long and had an overly convoluted plot with very little compelling about the characters. There are a few violent scenes to the end but almost comedic. But honestly, I stopped caring what happened to who.I guess I haven't seen any tarantino since Jackie brown. So I've clearly missed something. Brad Pitt had charisma but probably got upstaged by his dog. The little girl was amazing but had a bit part.I get Hollywood is seedy but the cinematography wasn't much but the 60s and 70s wardrobes were good. And there are some in jokes along the way but the film just wasn't funny. But it wasn't a noir film and the plot just dissipated into a very contrived showdown for fairly thin reasons.The way the twin plots met by the final scene, in a film for three hours, just felt contrived and rushed. I honestly would wait and stream it. Also don't believe the hype surrounding this film. Something really wierd goes on where reviewers seem to give Tarantino easy treatment", "Brilliantly made, but takes a long time to get where its going.": "An overly indulgent love letter to the late 60's American movie business that takes a long time to get going, but is worth it in the end.

So for me, someone who is used to Tarantino films being interesting all the way till the end (especially the end) , this movie to me said nothing, it just is an endless waiting for the ending because at least that remained really Tarantino like.\nThe characters are not clicking for me, the story isn't really there, but I'll admit my biggest mistake was going in the theater thinking that it would tell the real story of Charles Manson, which was obviously not what happened and the last scene was really entertaining and I thought to myself \"This must be Cliff 's trip on acid \" but then when the credits started rolling I realized that it was a Tarantino movie and as \"inglorious b*stards \" it didn't have a realistic ending. But I'll say that at least in Inglorious b*stards you kinda understand where the movie is going, which is historically inaccuracy, in this one you really just expect the real ending.", "QT resting on his laurels": "Im sorry, i do rate tarantino but OUATIH is missing too much for it to be enjoyable.

Yes the cinematography and the mood is great but the rest is just boring. The multitude of irrelevant western scenes last for hours on end (why so many for so long) and so many other scenes do not stand up on their own (why does damian lewis arrive? And the little girl?).

Any city economical study delves in what makes an industry to set roots in a given geography space. Where did workers come from? How money arrives in? Who bears the majority of hard work? Who enriches? Tarantino does it through the analysis of a western decadent actor trying to survive with the help of his stunt, a retired soldier. The Los Angeles excluded folks are represented by Charles Mason's gang that inhabits an abandoned cinema set. The camera keeps a closing focus on things that are representative to this industry like huge highlights and big cars. Both are shown with details to expose their importance in a city full of highways. Because of those registers beautifully filmed maybe watchers wont fell this almost three hours film. At the end of it the director of \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" delivers extreme violent scenes then close the film with a dinner among friends. A very interesting film that deserves to be watched.", "Delightful, in a very Tarantino Way": "Well, I'm probably one of those people, and there were certainly quite a lot of them, that simply went to see this movie because it was directed by Tarantino. Then again, his films seem to have that sort of drawing power - people go and see them simply because of the director, and that probably has a lot to do with the fact that despite this being his 9th film, he still pretty much bucks the trend. Yet, a part of me can't help but think that this might be a film that signals a turning point.Okay, we do know that he has basically indicated that he only wants to do ten films, namely because he works on the principle that, well, you only have so much imagination inside of you, and if you don't stop at a certainly point in time, then, well, you are just going to end up churning out rubbish. Mind you, Tarantino is an artist, and he certainly has a name for producing films that are quite out of the ordinary, yet a part of me felt as if this one, well, may just well be his magnus opus.I probably don't need to say all that much about the plot because people are probably quite familiar with it anyway. You see, it is about an actor, Rick Dalton (who apparently is based upon Burt Reynolds, who actually appears in the film), and his stunt double, who are trying to make sense of Hollywood of the late sixties. They talk about them coming to Hollywood, but a part of me feels that they have always been here. Anyway, he happens to own the house next to Roman Polanski, and Sharon Tate. Yeah, I guess we all know where that it going to end up - well, a part of us expects it to be the case.The interesting thing is that this is as much Sharon's film as it is Rick's (and of course his stunt double's). It is interesting how we seem to spend a lot of time following Sharon around. I guess a lot has to do with the fact that it was a life that was cut tragically short, and in fact from her performance in 'The Wrecking Crew' there have been suggestions that she was literally on the cusp of superstardom. Yet it seems as if Polanski (who doesn't even seem to have a speaking part, though I could be wrong) and Manson, are only playing bit parts. Then again, Manson probably has much more celebrity status that he deserves, and this who affair is probably the reason that he is so famous.Yet Tarantino is so meticulous - even though we are living through Tarantino world, he is still very careful to make sure everything is in its right spot, and the reasons for what happen are laid out. Mind you, this is like fifty years down the track, and many of us might have heard about the murder of Sharon Tate, but it is really only certain people would happen to know more than just what is common knowledge, and that doesn't seem to be all that much either.However, as some have suggested, it is still a movie about a world that is on the cusp of change, and a part of us feel that this is something that Tarantino understands. Here we are, fifty years from the events in the movies, and we are once again seeing a monumental shift the world of entertainment. Back then we were watching a movement from the big screen to the small screen (though I would argue otherwise, on the grounds that there had been televisions in people's houses for at least twenty years prior - Rick Dalton was originally a television star. However, television by this time had become ubiquitous. Yet we see a similar thing today, with the death of television, and the rise of live streaming. Further, screens have become ever bigger, meaning that, in part, it feels as if the cinema is, well, fading away.", "My Favorite of 2019!": "This movie was amazing in every way. The acting was phenomenal, from DiCaprio's emotional \"Rick Dalton\" to Pitt's laid back & cool \"Cliff Booth\". The production design and aesthetic were so well crafted & did a wonderful job selling the late 60's look &, Tarantino's directing really pulls you into the story and situation of the movie.This movie, and others from Tarantino's collection, really show you how film/cinema can be used to see justice served to those like the Manson Murderers or even Hitler in \"Inglorious Bastards\"(2009). Yet even in the title we are told that the events in the movie are nothing but a fairy-tale:\n\"Once Upon a Time\" ...

The classic Tarantino trait only came by at the climax, and even then I thought it was pretty underwhelming. There were lots of moments of built up tension that led to nowhere. Although I think it is still a good film, and I enjoy the hilarious overextended sequence of flashbacks about Cliff Booth and the acting of both leads, the film pales in comparison to the many towering works Tarantino has produced in his career and makes for a slight disappointment. Again, still, I think it is a well made film.", "\"Oh, no, you weren't supposed to take it seriously!\"": "Major spoilers here ahead! I have a friend who is a big QT fan and that's what he says when he anyone criticizes a QT film. So, then is it a comedy (nothing in this film hasn't been done already in a funnier way)? I didn't find it funny, just strange (though with some sadistic elements, a touch of racism, mysogyny, occasional tasteless mockery, etc.). The characters are not developed, other than a bit for Pitt's. There's no real plot, though at first (not knowing anything about the film) I thought it might be a comedy/bio-pic of a Clint Eastwood type of actor. As things go on we get the sense that the Manson murderers will be covered, though what we get is some sort of \"alt history\" that just makes one feel worse for Sharon Tate and the others who were killed by the Manson clan. We're supposed to be happy that all these years later someone made a lousy, very long film that featured a \"happy ending\" for Tate, Polanski, and the others affected by the murders? This is borderline psychotic to my way of thinking, but perhaps I'm \"getting too old for this kind of stuff\" (though I'm younger than QT).

In the end I didn't care anymore period. A movie needs to be moving - to me that's the criteria of a good movie.

A few female characters are thrown in, and \" Margot Robbie\" as Sharon Tate is a cinch. But showing the houses of Polanski, and that they have shifted,when they have a visitor, is confusing. On the script front Tarantino has failed. And there was no need to show the great Bruce Lee's character being thrown by Pitt's character against a car. What is Tarantino trying to prove here ?

So many talented director out there and he gets money and support for those pretentious cringefests he calls movies...Jesus Christ.

What a joke!", "Tarantino finally perfects the \"Hangout\" Movie": "Many of the negative reviews I see are about how this films plot is at a snail's pace. What these people don't realize is that this is probably Mr. Tarantinos goal. He created both a beautifully shot movie that encapsulates the essence of 60's Hollywood and managed to create the perfect Hangout movie. He himself coined the term Hangout movie and the meaning of it stems from the idea that by the end of the film you should feel like you have you are/could be friends with the characters. Because of this, most if not all Hangout movies move really, really slow. Not focusing on the plot so much as the characters and how they interact with one another. Some of the most notable hangout movies include Rio Bravo (1959) and Fast Times at Ridgemont High(1982). Many of Tarantino's other films could also be considered Hangouts most notably Jackie Brown(1997) and to a lesser extent Pulp Fiction (1994) and Hateful Eight (2015). This film does everything right, is it slow? Yes. But I never found myself board at all. And ultimately I found myself being wishing I could be friends with Brad Pitts and Leo Decaprios characters. In my opinion Mr. Pitt steals the show. and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate is so perfect that I don't believe any one else could have even come close. Do yourself a favor and WATCH THIS MOVIE. Even if it may not be a cup of tea, it's a work of art and should be treated like one.Bravo Mr. Tarantino", "No review here... but please read it..

DiCaprio acting was too good, Brad Pitt was very good as well and were the only watchable throughout till end. I was waiting for the story to begin till 15 mins to end... the story somehow kicked off to finish off. Oh... got it! Is it that \"Rick Dalton\" needed that 15 mins chaos to get to meet his neighbour? Thats all the story about? 161mins are too long for that. Anyways, watched it for DiCaprio and Brad Pitt and all the stars on my rating goes to them.", "Well if you re a normal person and not a blind Tarantino fan, you're gonna be dissapointed....": "This is not a usual Tarantino movie, and with all these famous actors he should have done something. Instead he made a movie without a story, boring sequence, meaningless scenes and half a plot. A couple of acting were good but the whole experience is tragic. A waste of time and money. Ain't worth nearly 3 hours. Sorry Tarantino... You have failed....", "The Film Nudist reviews: Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood": "As our favorite filmmakers continue to create movies, it's important not to heap praises on their films just because we like the person making them. I was ready to do that with \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" before stepping into the theatre. I heard this was a hangout movie, a sort of buddy comedy where people experience life and have a good time while doing it. And in a way, that's exactly what this movie is. As my incredibly attractive (listen, I'm not gay, Alex) friend said, the movie could be described as a bunch of non sequiturs that take place in 1960's Hollywood. On one hand, that's exactly what this movie is. But on the other hand, the last 20 minutes of the movie turn into, completely out of nowhere I might add, a surreal revenge-porn fantasy that, in my opinion, cheapened everything that came before it. While this movie is impressive on a technical level, I didn't personally consider it enjoyable. Now this might change on re-watches, but as of right now, my first impression is that this movie was, unfortunately, kind of mediocre.In terms of acting, this movie delivers. Leo and Brad deliver some of the most natural and entertaining Tarantino dialogue since \"Jackie Brown,\" and it's fun to watch them hang out, drink beer, and watch TV together. And while them hanging out takes up a good majority of the scenes in this film, the main crux of it is about Leo's character, Rick Dalton, experiencing a monumental amount of self doubt regarding his apparently withering star status. And this leads to some of the best scenes in the movie. Every time Leo was seen getting into character or filming his western, playing the villain no less, was incredibly entertaining. Specifically, watch out for the scenes that feature Leo and Julia Butters, who is probably the finest actress in the entire movie. I mean, her scenes with him are magnificent. Of course, Brad Pitt was amazing as well and had some of the funniest scenes in the movie, the one with Bruce Lee especially. I haven't seen Bradley Pitts on the big screen since \"Allied,\" so it was great to see the little guy in a theatre again.The set, production, and costume design were all also fantastic, but even a blind man could tell that. Now I'm not from the 1960's, so I can't speak to how accurate the portrayal of that time period was in this film. However, my grandfather is from the 1960's, but he's dead so he can't speak for that either (pour one out for my grandpa). But regardless, the sets were immaculately built and beautiful to watch on screen. The music, too, was fun to listen to, especially during scenes where Brad Pitt would just drive around. Those were great excuses for the audience to simply sit back and enjoy the music and scenery. And now let's get to the things I didn't like.As I mentioned, this movie could be seen as a slice of life type film where a bunch of characters go around and live their lives in 1960's Hollywood. And it is that, until the last 20 minutes where Tarantino had to, just had to, turn this movie into a revenge fantasy. We all know Quentin fetishizes revenge, violence, and feet (and yeah, there are like a million feet shots in this movie so if you're into feet too, no doubt you'll be creaming your pants). And in his other movies, the revenge sequences felt at least mildly earned and justifiable. But here, it literally comes out of nowhere with hardly any buildup, if you can even consider the Manson family subplot buildup in the first place. The Manson family is shown less than a handful of times in this movie, and every time they're on screen, they are hardly portrayed as threatening. Yes, we know that in real life they awfully and brutally murdered Sharon Tate. But in the context of this movie specifically, they don't do anything that warrants the brutal beat down that gets delivered to them at the end of this movie. And even if you do think that, in the context of this movie, they deserve to get killed, I personally don't think they needed to get killed in such a violent manner. I didn't want, or need, to see a woman get her face smashed repeatedly into everything within arms reach. I didn't need to see another woman get mauled by a dog while screaming horrifically for five minutes. I didn't need to see that same woman, bruised, bloodied, and battered, get torched to death by a flamethrower either, the camera almost lovingly showing her charred body in all its glory. The violence was just too much, out of nowhere, with little buildup, and no reason for it to take place besides, \"I'm Quentin Tarantino and I want my revenge on the Manson cult!\"\"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\" has its moments. I loved seeing Leo and Brad on screen together, and certain scenes were definitely entertaining. But as a whole, the disjointed narrative and ultra-violence was enough for this film to disappoint me.5/10", "Disappointed!": "I am giving it 5 coz leonardo and brad were awesome.

DiCaprio is totally miscast, and brings nothing at all the the character. The movie goes south when he's dominating the screen. The cinematography and special effects vis a vis the locations are first class and worth the price of a ticket. There are also *excellent* supporting cast performances. Tarantino dumps gratuitous violence in just a couple of places so if you're like me and don't like it, there's not much of that in general. (Note to Tarantino: the violence trademark is beyond old).Without doubt, for me the standout part of the film is the Bruce Lee scene which was widely disseminated by the distributors, so many people will have seen it. I consider it to be a masterpiece of direction, writing and acting. If Pitt deserved an oscar for Once upon a time he earned it here.", "For the cinematic intellectual": "This movie is not for the average weekend movie buff like me. It requires a unique set of appreciative skills for the artistic value imbibed within this film. The slow pace and its reflection on an era of style of film making gone by is not something that would stand out as a box office entertainer.\nFor students of the filmmaking arts though, it is something of a study in itself. I'm sure there will be a lot of applause from the section that views cinema not as a commercial, mass fed product that instantly gratifies all urges of the need to be entertained but as something that requires and calls for your appreciation.", "A long boring joke with an insult instead of a punchline": "Half-way through I wondered if this movie had been edited to start with a one hour blooper. I had second hand embarrassment watching these actors defecate on their careers with this overrated trash. DiCaprio should have set the tape of this film alight with his flame thrower. The only redeeming feature was the authentic costume design and set. The worst part was that Tarantino created an entire story revolving around one of the most interesting crimes in history and neglected to mention any of it, instead focusing on the development of two fictional men with the character depth of an ash tray.", "It's awful": "I don't know why people are afraid to admit that, or feel compelled to give a high rating. This is flat-out awful. It's painfully boring. There's no plot. There are more like some \"situations\", one after another, linked by terrible editing. The only \"plot moment\" is the ending, but it's very predictable. There are no Tarantino-style dialogues - for the first time in his 9 movies. There are no \"wow\" moments or hyperboles - for the first time in his 9 movies. The comedy is sparse. The movie unfolds as a dull trip through real-world characters, famous actors, tons of references to B-movies from the sixties, and nothing else. Literally: nothing else. I find it difficult to call it a movie, actually. It's more like a very personal and self-indulgent hommage to a kind of cinema he loves, but that's it. It ends up like a fictional and mildly funny documentary. I'm one of the most fanatic fans of Tarantino in the world, and this is not his old self, not in style and not in quality.Ps: Come on. I don't like fanboys and people who can't accept that the king is naked. The ending is pure mannerism and shocks nobody, also because there's no tension to resolve. Secondly, it's an anti-climax, the \"fixing\" of something broken, the inner wish of an old man who became reactionary. That's very different from the \"Inglourious\" ending, that was a shocking, epic and superfunny stroke of genius.", "Brilliant in many ways": "It's very upsetting to see so many 1 star reviewers. They clearly review with their heart not their head. 1 star on the scale is literally the worst something good be. Anyway this film has genius in it in so many subtleties. Brilliant cinematography, exceptional acting by the cast and just a really pleasant movie experience. Well done Tarantino. Hats off sir.", "Probably Tarantino's worst": "The only reason for watching this movie is the actors in it. Not sure what happened to Tarantino", "Great acting, no plot, no ending, no entertainment value": "Was excited to see this as I'm a big fan of QT, but was nearly 3 hours of dry, slow paced nothingness I can only compare to the ramblings of a demented uncles on his last legs. Great performances by Pitt and DiCaprio, but not enough to compensate for the poor writing and no ending.", "Nostalgic and Pretentious Twaddle": "A quite juvenile and exhaustingly clich\u00c3\u00a9d representation of an alleged and idealised Hollywood of the 60s. Filled with annoying and repetitive car shots, a shallow focus on details (\"this is what everything and everyone looked like in the 60s\") and unconvincing acting that also suffers from extremely dull dialogue. One frequently feels the desire to switch it off and do something worthwhile instead.", "Love Tarrentino": "I Love Tarrentino but this was so very, very slow & TBH really disappointing - not a classic by any stretch of the imagination - what was he thinking?", "Margot Robbie's character Sharon Tate is objectified, but there is a reason why.": "Margot Robbie's character Sharon Tate in Tarantino's \"Once Upon A Time in Hollywood\" seemed particularly one-dimensional and without a character-arc. There is a clue that Tarantino gives the audience that confirms this. At one point in the film, Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate enters a book shop and pets a black bird statue. That black bird statue looks exactly like the maltese falcon from the film \"Maltese Falcon\". In that classic film noir film directed by John Huston, the maltese falcon is used simply as a McGuffin, or an object to move the plot forward in the film but ultimately lacks significance. The bad guys commit crimes to try and find the maltese falcon and the detectives are after the bad guys for those crimes. When Tarantino has Tate pet that bird he is telling the audience that Sharon Tate's character is also a McGuffin, like the maltese falcon itself. Most of us know the story of how the real Sharon Tate was murdered by the Manson clan, and as an audience member we are waiting for her to be killed in this film. It provides tension and suspense but ultimately there is no payoff and no significance to her character, just like the Tarascan warrior statuette in Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\", the cash in Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and Tarantino's glowing briefcase in \"Pulp Fiction\". Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate is simply a beautiful object and a tool to help propel the story forward for the two lead multi-dimensional and well-defined male heros to shine. Sharon Tate's character is simply an object, a McGuffin without a character-arc and without any definition.", "Two Mega SuperB Stars": "These two mega superB stars of Hollywood are playing this historic movie in Hollywood.

They're by no means terrible, they're just really average, and dare I say horribly boring. In this one even the actors look checked out.", "Very disappointing": "Great actors for a boring story, I finished the movie and still couldn't get what's it all about, if it's all about movie industry back in late sixties or only about Quentin Tarantino it should've been done as a documentary not as a \"comedy drama\" movie considering that 90% of the world doesn't know who is Quentin Tarantino but the big names will make them watch the movie then get very disappointed same to my case. Also copying old movies \"sound effects, music, costumes, posters ..etc\" limited the creativity and the excitement factors", "not typical Tarantino movie": "My first pont is i belive Brad Pitt will recive an Oscar nomination for this movie...This is an all Dialog film very little action.Actually Margot Robbie barely speaks..maybe 20 lines total and not until 70% of the movie in....But it shows how cruel and unforgiving Hollywood was to some of its best stars.Reguardless of what they did in the past its what are you doing for us now.\nSome mistakes..theres no fried chicken in the wild west..a scene just before the duel..dicaprio is eating fried chicken..it dident exist in the wild west.Also one of the Italian directors name was the same name as one of the charcters in Inglourious Basterds the fake italian names used in the theater..its quick...pay attentionOver all i enjoyed the film walked away feeling like i saw something really good..brad pitt oscar nomination", "eh": "Close to the beginning of the movie Pitt's character drives his car from the house of Dicaprio's character. We see Pitt drive home for what had to be a minute. From that point on I was wondering what QT was doing. Then the end, which everyone seems to think was awesome, was, I thought, fairly lame. Is rewriting history really that great? Especially after he has done it in the past?", "Immensely Pleasurable Walk Down (Almost) Memory Lane": "Tarantino is a master at mythologizing the various scars of the American psyche. Here he is in his element, both doing what he loves and knows best and paying homage to his formative cinematic influences.Getting lost in the indulgent dialogue and exquisite period recreation is 75% of the fun.", "It's by far the worst movie i've seen in years.": "I can be short about this. It was very painfull to watch, almost 3 hours of total garbage and no story line, none whatsover.I'm glad i didn't get to see it in theathres. don't waste your time on it. If this movie didn't have the name Tarantino under it, it would have a score of 1 on IMDB. Too bad people who give this movie a 10 think that it's bc Tarantino is a genius and so are they. Wrong.", "Worst movie I have seen in a long time.": "It's obvious that Tarantino has completely lost it. This wasn't his worst movie but the worst movie I have seen in years. He probably was off his medication when he did this film. Two good actors went completely to waste with this movie. So sad, when you know what he is capable of doing when he wants to. Sorry Mr. Tarantino but you really goofed up this one. If I could give you a negative star I would have.", "What the hell was that?": "This was a very long film which didn't really have a plot that justified it being that long.Moral of the story...

Anyone got the phone number for the dogs agent?", "240 min of random spaghetti western scenes": "This is one of the most boring films ever made. Quentin Tarantino made a film for Quentin Tarantino and no one else. There is no plot or story, just some random spaghetti western scenes, some driving, and other pointless parts.Acting was great but the film is ridiculous and dull. The only reason I didn't leave the cinema before the film ended was because I was hoping that something will finally happen. It did, 5 min before the end and ending was also ridiculous.", "Violent, Humorous and Entertaining.": "Once upon a time in Hollywood may not be Tarantino's career best film, but it surely is the funniest movie he ever made. Similar to his previous films, violence is executed masterfully, being both brutal and hilarious at the same time.Tarantino does a great job in recreating 1960's Hollywood. Despite being an entertaining movie, it does fall back on few elements. Brad Pitt's character is poorly written, the story is loosely put together with few unnecessary scenes which don't add much value to the story or characters but showcases Hollywood in that era.As many have already mentioned this movie as being a \"Love Letter to Hollywood\", it focuses more on Hollywood aspect and less on the actual story.That doesn't mean the movie is poorly written. Apart from Brad Pitt's character, Tarantino has done a good job with the script. Caprio's character is very well developed, Bruce Lee's fight scene is humorous and violence is more brutal.", "Get ready for surprises !!": "With Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Quentin\nTarantino returns to Los Angeles for the first time since the Kill Bill movies, This intense crime drama is set in 1969 and tangentially involves the Manson Family as well. The movie follows the life of a string of characters, over a few months in time. it's a very beautifully made, complex, funny, and smart, though it does mix up fact and fiction a lot, with real history and fake history crashing up against each other combining into one great entertaining movie.The essence of the movie is in its 1960s era costumes and its production design. Casting is perfect to the core and couldn't have been any better. Characterisation is made very well by a apt screenplay, which deserves an academy award. The choice of lenses used by the cinematographer is marvellous and depicts the mood of the period. Excellent acting by a host of actors are an added strength to Once upon a time in Hollywood. No guesses but Brad Pitt excels over Leonardo di caprio, who is on fire this time. Margot Robbie is a little slow to get off the blocks but kinda ok. Quentin Tarantino work as a director is refreshing with this subtly funny, beautiful period movie which teases history, and mixes life and art into one cool, wild collage.This is definitely One of the best Quentin Tarantino movies, a great set of slow burn trademark vignettes leading up to the gory climax in his style. Overall, A must watch movie for all those who have enjoyed Tarantino's movies before. You will not be disappointed with of surprises springing up.", "Agatha's Bulletin Board: Better watch it as a meta-documentary about late 60s, because if you try to watch it as a movie ... you fail.": "It is good for me to see at last QT fans confessing here how boring & stupid that film was. Thank God there exists the Fast Play button!If you want my opinion: I think QT gave whatever he had to give with his first two films, which were of quite good ranking; not at all exceptional but I sort of like them. Now, after those first two films, I keep seeing over and over again completely stupid & boring long dialogues with no substance at all, about clueless things, just filling in the movie time, having as a possible excuse (I presume) the \"character building\"! OMG, If QT's sripts were for Oscar then what would Woody's scripts deserve? The whole galaxy maybe ...Nevertheless, the good part is that you can watch the OUATIH as a documentary about late 60's, since the ONLY effort put when creating/making this film, seems to be the one of representing as good as possible that era and nothing else (e.g. Cars, buildings, settings, clothes)", "Upon Watch number 7 this movie and the nuances grow on me": "So sa solace in theaters. We liked it, but it was really fast paced at times, and a little slow at other times. The cast is great DiCaprio stellar Brad Pitt stellar. But I don't think we really realized how good this movie is until you watch it a few times, because there are subtle little lines that are hard to mess, if you pay attention but first go around or two he missed them and once you watch a few times boy is it worth catching those little lines this movie is great it captures probably what it felt like to be in movies at this time and it definitely avoids a catastrophic ending that we all know really happened but that's fun it makes it feel better and what really happened and gives us a little help maybe. Anyway, the second have a smoothie is probably some of the best Tarantino written content you could ever imagine when hippies get smoked I mean that's the best. Brad Pitt, probably deserved and Oscar for this.Watch, enjoy several times because there's a lot to catch in here that has big Lebowski vibes not quite the same, but certainly close.", "Once upon a time in the magical Tarantino land": "First of all I have to point out that I am a huge Tarantino fan. I grabbed those movie tickets so fast as I really couldn\u00b4t wait to see this masterpiece. And I really could not imagine a Tarantino flick to not be a masterpiece so I am comfortable making this assumption. So before I got the chance to see it on the big screen I\u00b4ve heard some of the reviews and to my surprise they were very different. Some people were saying this is a great movie, some were saying this was one of the worst they have seen yet or from Tarantino at least. Some said the movie was boring, had no content and that only the ending was exciting and fun. Then also to my surprise I heard people talking that Brad Pitt did such a great job in his role that he outshined Leo. So I was very curious to see it all with my own eyes. So here goes my opinion:\nThis movie for me from the very start to the finish (and yes I mean to the very end where they show credits and you see some more scenes with Leo) was nearly perfect. I only give it a 9 because I don\u00b4t like giving out 0.5 points and 10 is just top of the top for me and not for taking lightly. The cinematography was exquisite, like always with Tarantino. All the details, all the perfect frames. My eyes were fully enjoying it all.\nThe actors. Well, Tarantino always knows how to pick them. I was very happy to see Emile Hirsch on the big screen again (haven\u00b4t seen him for a while and I think he is a great actor with some special charm that leaves you wanting more). I always enjoy watching Timothy Olyphant, because there is something mysterious about him and his voice is mesmerizing. The little girl, Julia Butters, well scenes with her were one of my favorites in this movie, talented little girl. Seeing Luke Perry was a bit sad, but I was glad I saw him. Damian Lewis is also one of my favorites, a very talented actor. Well and of course Al Pacino, when has he ever disappointed. And for the main characters now - I have actually seen Margot Robbie in a few movies only, but in those few she has rocked it. She has a certain charisma about her, a bit of mystery and a whole lot of classical beauty. Now about Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio - do I think one of them outshined the other? Nope, I absolutely don\u00b4t. I have always known both of them are excellent actors, the best of the best and I saw exactly that in this movie as well. For me it kind of seems like people are maybe rooting for Brad Pitt a bit because well I personally haven\u00b4t seen him on a big screen for a while now (actually the last movie I saw with him on a big screen was Fury and it was great) and it is really great to watch him do what he does best. The role of Cliff Booth was excellent for him, he really got to shine as a diverse character who was so loyal, helpful, kind-hearted, witty and also strong, curious and brutal if necessary. He carried the role out with perfection, I couldn\u00b4t imagine anyone else doing it. I would like to see him in some more roles like this in the future. But to say he overshined Leo is a bit unfair I think. Leo\u00b4s character was very different and by far less likable to the audience, because he was insecure, a bit depressed, unsure of what to do and so he didn\u00b4t make us laugh as much or root for him in very intense scenes. But if you keep in mind that this is exactly what he was supposed to do and how many emotional scenes he had playing his character in the westerns or being Rick Dalton, he was amazing. He was simply amazing. He was sad and depressed, then happy with his friend Cliff, then roaring angry in his western scenes and a bit dorky and weird in the cut-out scenes or even with the scene at the end with the flamethrower - I mean it was a bit funny in the most excellent way.\nIn conclusion, I loved this movie. Tarantino, please make some more.", "2.5 hours of sheer boredom": "Long, plodding, dull, confusingly edited, and way too many women's feet. It was exactly as bad as it looked in the trailers. Almost no action and Tarantino's trademark clever dialog is completely absent. Tarantino's self-indulgence has finally caught up with him. The first of his films I genuinely disliked.", "Wayyy overrated": "Someone must have paid a lot of money to skew this movie's rating upward. Way down there amongst the worst movies I've watched.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME", "Ponderous": "Tarantino has lost his touch.This movie has a start studded cast, and meanders through a pointless 135 minutes before coming to a 15 minute climax.", "Decent hang-out nostalgia movie - with a sour taste": "Enjoyed it far more than Tarantino's last few movies - for the most part. But the last 15 mins are Tarantino at his absolute worst, and ultimately leave a sour taste in the mouth - after what is otherwise a very enjoyable period hang-out movie.Weirdly, until the ending, you might be hard pushed to even tell this was even a Tarantino film. It's visually and stylistically languid (in an enjoyable way) - but not as self-indulgent on dialogue as you'd expect (though maybe not as sharp either). It also seems to rely a lot more on traditional (though heavily invisible-vfx-aided) cinematography than his previous movies. In a lot of ways it feels like his his most conventional film. The cast are effective, the mood is enjoyable, and I can see what he was going for - even with the ending - though I think he made a terrible hash of it.Tarantino is obviously a hugely gifted filmmaker. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs are stone cold classics, and all his films have flashes of genius. But his obsessions with graphic misogynistic violence and self-righteous masochistic revenge become more disturbing with each film. It demeans his output, and leave you questioning the sincerity of everything else he puts on screen these days. Although for nearly 2h 30mins here, I thought he might have finally grown up - the last 15 mins see him once again cave-in to all his worst instincts.There's still a lot of fun to be had here, but I'd just love to see a Tarantino movie that didn't involve trying to raise giggles from teenage boys by smashing another woman's face in or dishing out boorish ultraviolence to more wrongdoers from history.Because when he's not doing these things he's still an excellent filmmaker.PS - The depiction of Bruce Lee in this film is a truly bizarre - especially when you'd assume QT was a big fan. Another sour taste.", "Couldn't Even Finish Watching": "With all the big name actors and great ratings you'd think this movie was good, but I can assure you it isn't. There's absolutely no point, slow as could be and a waste of anyone's time. If you're reading about review and they're rating anything greater than 1, they must have been drunk when watching this to get any enjoyment.", "Good...But not that good for a Tarantino Film": "This is a short Review : Beginning with the advantages which was the Oscar Acting From both DiCaprio and Brad Bitt. Second was of course the directing can't talk about directing because everybody knows Tarantino's Directing. But for the disadvantages it's of course that the movie don't have a story! I know he want us to see Hollywood in 60's and know about Sharon Tate murder but come on we wanted a good story, what was Margot Robbie doing along the film ? Just dancing in every song in it. All in all it was good and I love Tarantino Films.", "QT viz Cohen Bros": "QT has delivered some giant entertaining stuff over the decades. Possibly like the similar entertaining skyscrapers the Cohen Bros he has eclipsed ????\nPatrick", "Approx 1 hour 30 min to long.": "Great actorS and then... Nothing, waiting waiting waiting, I think you have to be a Tarantino fan to like this. 2 hours 30 mins. of my life, lost for good.", "Hollywood's Greatest Shine Bright but Good Not Great Story. Oh and lots of feet.": "OK so... Something we all knew, the acting in this is simply superb. Hollywood's finest really excell with Leo, Brad and Pacino showing off why they're the elite actors in the business.One scene stood out in particular where Leo gets incredibly angry with himself for forgetting his lines and has a mini breakdown over it and the emotion Leo shows is amazing to witness. Margot does a fantastic job also especially in the theater scene where she shows her excitement and joy at watching the film.The acting is second to none but the story however is not. It focuses on Leo's or \"Rick Daltons\" career as a fading actor who is doing what he can to keep his name and fame alive. This just didn't draw me in enough and I found very little to keep me watching except 2 plot points, one was who was the mysterious guy who showed up to margots house 30 minutes in and the second was the girl who takes a liking to Brad. The first one goes absolutely nowhere and ends as quickly as it began but the second became the main reason I kept watching. This hippie girl who eventually gets a ride (no not that way) from Brad turns out to be a vital part of the story and it done enough to stop me reaching for my phone.Side note as with all Tarantino films the kinky old dog who has a well known foot fetish gets his young actresses to show their feet in any given opportunity and yet again you see plenty of the same. Margot shows her dirty feet off in the cinema scene which feels unnecessary and doesn't fit but old Quentin is doing it for his own satisfaction, then within minutes you have the hippy girl called pussy put her dirty feet on the dash of the car. OK quentin we get it, you get turned on by feet but can you stop showing me them every 2 minutes please. Several other scenes showing off feet which makes it half annoying half funny that he gets away with doing this in every film. It's became his watermark.The last 20 minutes were for me the best as everything goes from slow and steady to so completely over the top its funny, but in a good way. From Brad taking an Acid dipped cigarette and tripping out to 3 hippies attempting to kill him but completely failing and end up being a dog chew. The flamethrower was madness but it made perfect sense given the over the top scene. In the end the last 20 minutes made me bump the rating up a notch as it makes this film somewhat memorable but I have to say this is one of the poorer Tarantino films I've seen. Still an experience, but more of a timid one.", "A homage & change of narrative at end of a tragic story": "I liked the movie very much, slow and subtle start and mellow too. Movie is a homage to an old is gold era & the ending is a change of narrative of a tragic and true story.I felt that the QT wanted to showcase and translate the general public sentiments around the tragic death of Sharon Tate and how those nutcase hippies should have met their end instead making them celebrities on news media of time along with the cult of Charles Manson. The real life ending was so sad and tragic but in the movie QT gives a satisfying end so to appreciate life of good people.", "Funny, engaging...another great Tarantino": "Its a Quentin Tarantino movie, so as soon as it comes out we ear it as either his best job or a flop.\nI enjoyed it pretty much. It brings something different to Tarantino's work, but at the same time it's still a Tarantino movie. This being said, it's important that you know the real life story behind the movie so you can understand some of the characters (Manson, the hippies and Sharon Tate). Beside that it's not the story that everyone already knows. It is not a documentary about it. It has it's own life and exists perfectly without it. Personally, I went to the cinema expecting something and the result was completely different, but yet it made complete sense to me and I enjoyed it.\nLeo Dicaprio delivers a great performance, everyone on my session were laughing our hearts out during some scenes and in others I could feel myself missing those times in Hollywood even though I have never been there, but I guess that says pretty much about bringing the audience to the movie atmosphere (special thanks to the soundtrack).Overall I saw many different people from different ages watching this movie while I was there and we all had one thing in common: we enjoyed it. Wouldn't mind watching again because those scenes are still on my mind.", "It's a setup.": "Let's go on and on about nothing for two hours.

Five years on what? The 'script' comes across like a discarded 1st rough draft that someone's picked up and filmed, mistakenly thinking it's the finished article.The acting is fantastic, but one can only assume these 1st class actors thought, while filming their random pointless scenes, that Tarantino would then take them and finely craft it together with sublime editing, coherence and pace. When for the most part he glued them together any old how.I'm also shocked that Debra Tate gave her blessing to allow her sister to be filmed in such a one dimensional way. Quentin Tarantino obviously couldn't be bothered to really think about what Sharon Tate was actually like, let alone give her any lines.Perhaps one day QT will confess this whole film is an elaborate joke at Hollywood's expense. That it was an experiment to see if it was possible to sell a 'style over substance' plot to the big movie moguls and fool them into thinking they were getting the next Citizen Kane.My score is for the actors, the retro look & feel, some few & far between interesting scenes, and the dog.", "All though this doesn't come close to being Tarantino's Opus It is with out a doubt a great comedy and a smart one too \"better than the hateful 8\" not as good as JB": "This is a 2 hour movie stretched out for no real reason to almost 3 hours\nIt can get boring and repetitive\nBut it's never dull\nAnd just when you're getting ready to throw the towel ...Tarantino's famous dialogues rescues the movie and places it back on track\nA- you will laugh at crucial points of the movie\nB- you will fill empathy for some of the characters\nC- if you're from LA and was around in the late sixties you will feel nostalgic throughout the movie\nD - definitely worth the ticket", "Horrible movie": "I went to watch this seeing all good reviews.

I think I really waste my time by watching this movie.\nI'd expect more from Decaprio and Brad Pitt", "Not Tarantino's Greatest but Still a Hell of a Good Time!": "Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is definitely not his best but it's still pretty fucking good. Calling it right now, this will win best picture at the Oscars.It'd be bold to call this DiCaprio or Pitt's greatest performances when Wolf of Wall Street and Fight Club exist. However, I'll definitely say they are spectacular in every way and put their talent into full use. Pitt is endlessly charismatic and DiCap is such a joy to watch.The production design... holy shit! That is the real MVP of the film. Every thing on screen is so era specific and thoroughly wrapped me in the Golden Age of LA. Tarantino's script is hilarious and beautifully done as always and there were so many of his identifiable flares scattered around, even if there were a bit too many foot shots. Speaking of shots, the cinematography is... oddly done. There are an unusual amount of dutch tilts and even weirder, many of the tilts are close ups on the actors faces and it just looks bad. That being said, the rest of the cinematography looks pretty good and there are some truly impressive camera moves throughout.Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood is a really well made film that has some glaring problems. The movie doesn't actually go anywhere until the third act. Every thing before it, despite being fun, add nothing to the movie. There are random scenes with Sharon Tate at the movies that amount to absolute nothing and... you know what? My biggest issues are with the Sharon Tate character. Margot Robbie is great as always, but the character is just kinda there, awaiting the looming third act. Of course you some scenes with Tate but they all felt boring and in the end, added nothing to the movie.Overall, I had a hell of a good time watching this, even if it's not everything I was hoping it'd be. I avoided all reviews and plot details about the movie and I was thoroughly surprised with the direction it went. The entire third act contains some of the greatest work of Tarantino's career and there were so many moments where the audience I was sitting with couldn't help but cheer and clap. We were all 100% in for the ride and we experienced something amazing due to Tarantino and his phenomenal cast and crew that made a glorious picture.Alamo Drafthouse - San Francisco", "Boring af": "Target group is grandma and grandpa.\nDummes Matschogehabe, sinnlose Story, kein H\u00f6hepunkt.", "Could have had a better soundtrack": "Crazy, but enjoyable.

I understand he normally has some violence in his films, but this was such an unfortunate time period with Manson.", "I wish this movie was never made": "I cannot believe i sat through that unrelated shoelace mix up of a movie.", "meh": "I never thought I'd say this for a tarantino movie but It was a bad film. as far as plot it was just pointless, the only reason i'm giving it a 5 is because of the amazing performance of Dicaprio and Pitt", "What a disappointment": "The worst Tarantinomovie so far. Almost 3 hours of total boredom. Absolutely nothing happens in this movie. There is kinda no story. Even the whole scene where Brad Pitt went to that Hippy-ranch was totally in vain and made absolutly no sense. The little tension that scene could build up was destroied with it's ending.\nAnd the ending of the movie, well, there was none, what is understandable since there was no story. It's simply ridiculous. There was only one short gag that made me giggle, in the whole movie.\nIf it wasn't for Leonardo Di Caprio acting as good as he always does the movie would end up in my \"top 10\" of the worst movies I've seen. It has been a while since a movie made me count the minutes while watching it.", "WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH": "It was a rainy day so I decided to go watch a film, a Tarantino film. I went knowing that there would be an abundance of ultra violence but strangely it was not the case, well at least not for most of the movie.Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is extremely slow paced and drawn out experience for most of the 161mins, in which I found I had plenty of time to fidget around looking at my watch etc.The two main characters in the film DiCaprio and Pitt are probably what holds this movie headache together, Al Pacino's role is forgettable whilst Tarantino's directing is a bit patchy although some shots/angles were compelling.It's a long, long, long movie where it will score brownie points from critics and moviegoers alike simply because they adore Tarantino style in your face violence.One thing is for certain 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' is sure to add more trash to our subconscious mind set.", "\" Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.\"": "Theres something to be said about being entertained by an art film. Films now a days are either or. Entertaining but not very deep. Deep but not something I'd care to watch again. Tarantino has achieved the perfect balance. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt prove that you don't need a comic book to stay relevant. A perfect pairing on par with Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Although perfect together their standalone scenes are just as engaging. The only qualm I could say is that while the supporting cast is stellar we never get bellow skin deep enough to latch on to them. That being said this is certainly a film worth watching again and again.", "A Couple of Hours Waiting for it to start... Then it ends.": "All that talent and absolutely no plot or storyline to enjoy whatsoever. My wife and I kept waiting thinking it would pick up... And waited some more... 1.5 hours in and still nothing entertaining.No idea how it's so highly rated or award winning, literally baffled. If you have lived the golden age Hollywood era then this may be a walk down memory lane I guess.", "Not a classic Tarantino you expect": "To start off , this movie is not for everyone and only watch it only if you totally understand the true beauty of cinematography and acting because movies are not only about a strong constructive story. Leo and Brad Pitt delivered outstanding performances and it was gripping and amusing all at the same time. Multiple storylines with very clever writing very clearly captured the American golden age of cinema and I believe it couldn't have been shown in any better way possible. It is a must watch for all actual movie lovers who can truly appreciate cinema.", "Movie magic without a bunny in the hat.": "A good movie is not the same as a well made one. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a good example of a well-made production, but it is not enough. There is nothing to object to the production, the actors etc. What separates Once Upon a Time in Hollywood from a good movie is what you bring from the movie. Previous Tarantino films have in most cases shown the filmmaker's talent in just leaving a lasting imprint. How he has managed to create 2.5 hours of cinematic brilliance without any significant amount of content is puzzling. It may be a talent or the movie is a failure.\nI had to see it again. Maybe I had a mini stroke the first time I saw it because the emptiness after the movie might indicate that I may have had a mini stroke or something similar. So I spent about 5 hours and 20 minutes trying to find the greatness of the film. Nothing. The film is like a fireplace video.\nIt feels sad to give such a well-played and well-made movie so few stars but if I'm honest, 3 out of 10 still feel generous in this case.Big names and hype will probably entice many viewers to waste several hours of their lives watching this movie. A small number of fans will be lyrical, but I think most will leave the movie theater with a void in their life history that will be difficult to explain even if quantum physics is used.", "Historical or Fiction": "I'm a fan of history, I love the authenticity that went into this film. The cars, the clothes, music, commercials, sets and language are all on point. I almost thought Rick Dalton was a real person. The slow build and character development was classic QT. Now the last third of the film really lost me. The movie piqued when Cliff Booth went to the ranch. That scene alone reminded me of the tension in Hateful Eight. But then we get into Kurt Russell quickly narrating the next six months and up to the very h plour the infamous Manson murders took place.Everything after that is pure fiction. That's where the film lost me. Either make the entire film fictional or historic, don't combine the two. It doesn't work, revising history is pointless. I wish QT went the other direction and ended the story the way it really ends. It's almost as if while filming Titanic, James Cameron decided the boat shouldn't sink at the end and everyone gets off ok. The violence was pointless, the dog attack scene was just vicious and Cliff Booth came off as a real woman killer by the end of the film. I give this movie 6/10 because I liked it up till about 60%. What a strange film.", "Misleading commercials. Bad movie": "Expected more from the movie. It was horrible. Waste of money.", "Boring and pointless": "I was excited to see this film as i love a tarantino movie. Turns out its rubbish. Long winded, boring and no apparent plot line really. How its managed to get a 7.7 rating I don't know. Probably the most disappointing film I have watch. And I paid for it which makes it double disappointing", "Quentin's Masterprice": "This is the movie all we were waiting for, di caprio brad pitt is a fantastic duo, everybody that hasn't watch it , GO AND WATCH IT BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT", "Puts you to sleep": "I have endured an entire hour of this film before giving up on it, and during that time there was no indication of any plot whatsoever. I haven't walked out of a movie before, and I enjoyed all of tarantino's work so far, which made it all the more surprising, but sitting through two hours of tedium to get to the plot is just not worth it.", "Another dud by Tarantino.": "No tempo\nno drive\nJust a story that isn't going anywhere cause we already know Manson is a nutjob that sends his hippie assassins to kill Sharon Tate and everybody in the house.\nAnd it's not a documentary either.. so it's a dud.\nturned it off halfway because it's that boringJust like The Hateful Eight was boring, and Death Proof was boring.\nThis movie does not deserve to be titled \"once upon a time in...\" , it's not worthy of that title because it puts itself in line with Once upon a time in the West... a legendary movie, which clearly this isn't.", "One of the worst movies of theyear.": "I watched the whole movie hoping it would get better, I was wrong. Only good scenes were the ones with Brad Pitt.

I really wish I could spoil it but it is literally impossible as this movie is about nothing. Pitt and DiCaprio are very good actors and doing great as usual however their talents are totally wasted in this boring falsification of history.\nToo long, too slow and totally pointless.", "Bruh People Don't Understand": "This one of my fav movies of all time my homies. People don't understand bro they expect all the usual Tarantino craziness but the movie is literally just a vibe embrace it and stfu.", "My wife fell asleep": "The pacing on this was exceedingly slow. At just around 3 hours, I found myself fairly disinterested throughout much of the film. There are some good moments, but not enough to make me want to watch it again.", "Slop": "Meandering, boring nothingness. Kept waiting for anything to happen. But it didn't.

Much publicized. A rich gate and thousands of film viewers reviews.\nAbove all, as the title implies as conceived and realized by Tarantino: it's a fairy tale, with gratuitous violence and much nostalgia of a Hollywood of the 1960s, with cultural references in music and ambiance that are hardly exhilarating or unsettling.\nIt's a buddy film: Leonardo DiCaprio and an aging Brad Pitt. (A good pairing that deserves a better film.)\nIf 'Once Upon ... has a political subtext: it's violent America in Vietnam and gun violence that never cease, even today, to claim victims.\nThe film is a simplistic and condescending nod to Clint Eastwood's decaying and depressing career until he went to Italy to star in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns.\nIt's magical realism in the way Brad Pitt and even DiCaprio meet and give the Manson Gang a lesson they won't forget.\nThe film lacks palpable anger and is scatter shoot in emotions, especcally a weepy and self-pitying DiCaprio.\nTechnically Tarantino knows how to make a film, but it's hardly a major film.\nAl Pacino turns in a wonderful cameo as a sterotypical Hollywood Jewish producer who Anglicizes the pronunciation of his name and has a non Jewish wife.", "A slow start but a great ending": "For the first hour or so, it is hard to distinguish what the plot of the movie really is. It seemed like a jumble of different scenes, with no real connection. I'm the middle of the film, we had some really good acting from DiCaprio, and a plot awakened, And in the last 40 mins, it was pure cinema. Brilliant cinematography and acting. If the film was consistent, it would likely have been one of the best films of the year for me.", "Once upon a time.. like a bedtime story will put you to sleep": "Big named actors, director, lots of money, the only thing missing was a plot line. The whole movie is set in the 60s/70s but shot in modern color wide screen high definition, which makes it loose a lot of the nostalgia magic. There's two main characters one a western actor and the other his stunt double and then for some reason the Manson family comes in. It is almost 4 hours moves as slow as a snail and seems to have no point and is a bit random.", "Subversion of expectations": "There is a technique in movie making/ storytelling that is called subverting expectations, when you expect things to play out a certain way and then things take a complete left turn and you end up in a completely different place! There are quite a few moments like these that left me in complete disbelief.I applaud the man for that. To me this movie was pretty entertaining but very drawn out. It is more of an 8/10 for me but I just had to give it another mark for the breathtaking cinematography! (No surprise there it is a Tarantino film) but I really love the different unconventional camera angles he uses in this one.Also, the movie to me was pretty damn funny but it's done in a very subtle, tongue in cheek sort of way. There is a lot going on in this movie amd it can become quite convoluted so you have to pay attention.Judging by the negative reviews this film is not for everyone but it is an absolute gem and a love letter to cinephiles. The casting was impeccable, the set design/ costumes were impeccable, the soundtrack impeccable, the cinematography impeccable, the acting was really good too.Overall it was a great movie and I will be seeing it again. Again, it is not for everyone and the pacing could've been a little better. I would only recommend you watching it if you are a cinema afficionado like me. Tarantino is a genius.", "Wow...": "I never expected a movie that doesn't follow up the end of the story which it is based on, and it is not something bad, it's actually something I enjoyed and appreciate, also, I just can't get over the outstanding cinematography and retro style.", "Not Tarantino's best but great nevertheless": "This movie has some of the best cinematography I've seen during the first hour, the acting is obviously outstanding considering the cast. Brad Pitt masterclass as usual. I feel like if you don't appreciate great cinema and just focus on the plot you might not enjoy the first 1 hour 45 minutes. The ending is classic Tarantino and it's what makes him one of the best of all time.", "Quentin just had fun of us": "The movie is so boring that you are going to think about to leave the cinema. Quentin just had tried to laugh about all of us and he did it. At the end, on the TV appears one guy who says \"Now is the moment that everyone was waiting for\".He just made us loose 2 hours and 20 minutes in order to enjoy the only 20 good minutes of the movie, the end.Quentin knew that we would watch the movie waiting for action and in my opinion he just tried to laugh about us. Money wasted, next time that he makes a movie I will try to read the comments before.", "Seriously!": "Pitt was great, as was DiCaprio. Movie.....boring p**h. Seriously Tarantino, get over yourself", "When the violence began, I left the cinema": "Sharon is portrayed by Margot Robbie who looks/sounds nothing like her and\nbesides that - as you've probably heard - she just walks around the city and doesn't talk much and acts like a blonde bimbo.In my opinion, the only actress that looks like Sharon (based on her facial features) is Keira Knightley. On Sharon's Instagram fan page (adoringsharon) you will find a GIF where theese two are put together in one \"frame\" and you can clearly see how much they look-alike.As for the movie, I overslept most of it and didn't care. When the violence began towards the end, I got a panick attack and ran from the cinema, leaving my two friend behind. The ending was ... sick, too loud, over the top, not original - I've seen a similar ending in another movie made that year,\n\"The Haunting of Sharon Tate\".In \"The Haunting of Sharon Tate\" I appreatiated the twist at the end because Sharon and her friends overpower the intruders and kick their asses instead of someone else doing the fighting for them. And yea, I know, there is something else to that ending, but let's leave that for now... The movie somehow (not that I am comparing myself to miss Tate's tragic fate) reminded me of my life, when I've been bullyed a lot and lived in toxic environments - untill I stood up to my bully and took control over my life again. So this ending was much more satisfactory for me as a viewer than the Tarantino's one.The only positive emotion that Tarantino was able to trick out of me was the time when Margot Robbie/Sharon goes to the bookstore and asks for Thomas Hardy's Tess. I have that book at home because I know Sharon loved it, and I've respected/loved her since I first saw her in Polanski's movie \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" ages ago. That's it.RECAP: this movie is a waste of time and should be forgotten by the public as soon as possible. Minus 100 stars from me for this one.", "Overrated, Just Mediocre": "This is definitely an overrated movie. This movie is best described as a mixed bag. The acting ranges from great to absolute garbage. The movie never takes off, it just feels like it's moving so slowly. It made me bored. The plot is not fully developed either which annoyed me. Overall, very mediocre & not worth movie ticket price. Sorry, but as much as I love the director, this is definitely one of his worst ones to date. Better than Deathproof but that's it. This would be the second worst movie he's made.", "First of all its Tarantino": "Two and half hours of 50s and 60's nostalgia for those that would enjoy of course. It's a Tarantino film so basically love it or hate it, the ending will always be worth it or at least this one was. Unexpected bromance, literally every actors' role in this film was executed professionally. It even had a few roles sprinkled in there starring Timothy Olyphant, Luke Perry(God rest his soul), and even Mike Moh playing Bruce Lee.Mike Moh's portrayal of the great Bruce Lee was very controversial according to his daughter with complaints that she didn't like his portrayal in the film, most of the fandom would most likely agree, I don't blame them. Bruce Lee wasn't meant to be some mix martial artist to just get his ass kicked by Brad Pitt, but he clearly got his ass handed to him by Cliff Booth who seems to have much more of a backstory that I'd like to see/know more about, a spin-off would be awesome hell just shut up and take my money for that!But back to Tarantino's Bruce Lee, it was clearly meant to be a parody so there really is no need to panic and freak-out and getting offended over it. I'm a Bruce Lee fan myself and even I'm able to differentiate a parody versus a live action reiteration. However on a totally different note, Mike Moh did a profoundly spectacular impression of Bruce Lee himself, just watching him monologuing really convinced me that I was watching a reincarnation of Bruce Lee.Last thing I have to add is how badass Tarantino made Brad Pitt's \"Cliff Booth\", and that ending taha, he killed two people whilst High on acid that's a good old Tarantino ending for ya. And even thought I'm only 18 I was loving all the 60's vibes, seemed like things were much simpler back then.", "A crazy ride through Hollywood hills": "You will watch this movie and get turned on your head at the end. Tarantino is an auteur and best in the business.", "Why make this movie?": "Solid performances but what is the purpose of this movie? And why so many oscar nominations? It is like the producers thought \"screw the audience. Lets make a boring Hollywood movie for Hollywood movie makers. We are going to get Oscars anyway because we know them and they know us\"That's how this whole thing looks like. It was like watching a theater play. The only interesting part was the last 10 minutes.Nowadays, If you produce something weird, or gay, or you support a minority, you get dozen oscar nominations.", "Zz": "Dont for get the pillow and blankets as all this film will do is send u 2 sleep..", "Don't believe the hype": "Quentin Tarantino wanted to make masterpiece but he failed actually. The main characters looking like from a bunch of same B movies. No any extra value on. He made from Bruce Lee a complete idiot. We don't know how he was but I think QT also doesn't. He just try to make more and more surprising fictional events. At began with the Bastards which was a kind of unique. But he's just repeating just repeating just repeating. QT has no fresh ideas. It's better for everybody that he's going to make a TV serie. Maybe it will be good. From KilBill1 he's going down with quality and freshness also. He needs to stop directing.", "A Big Expensive Nothing Burger": "Kudos to the Art & Graphics Dept's ! But where's the meat? Only a thin slice of \"another Hollywood has been story\", not even enough for event TV..... Then what if the Manson gang went to the wrong house? ....Sorry", "Very disappointing.": "The attempt to have the two story lines intersect at the climax of the movie fell flat. Primarily because as it was told, there was no Tate story line. She was just living in LA with her friends. We know how it ended in real life, but in this revision, nothing happens, then something almost happens but doesn't. her Character has no motivation in this movie.\nAnd the big scene with Pitt visiting Spahn ranch was irrelevant. You could edit out the entire scene and the only change that would need to be made was the fact that Pitt recognized Tex. That's it. And why on earth would he cast Lena Dunham. She is disgusting, annoying, and out of place in the movie.", "An awesome plot. Awesome attention.": "I just purchased this movie. Sharon Tate and her friends death was such a depressing mark on the late 60s, it hurts me of the story. What I would love is that this plot in the movie should've been a reality...", "Waste of time and talent!": "I normally love QT movies and was excited. But this was just a whole lot of nothing.\nWas waiting for the movie to make some sense, never did! Waste of time and money!!", "Ignore the negative reviews": "Not as good as pulp fiction agreed but very decent acting and all round movie.Maybe it is a bit slow for some but I enjoyed it and decent ending.De DiCaprio is excellent but Pitt steals the show for me he really is a quality actor indeed.", "Un-hippie Ending": "Tarantino delves into the Manson murders in the summer of '69 and reimagines the gory events we all know about via the imaginary characters of fading leading man Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his not very similar-looking stuntman, DIY guy and buddy-buddy Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). It turns out that Rick lives one door down from the infamous house rented out that summer by Roman Polanski and his heavily pregnant wife Sharon Tate and the one to which Charles Manson ordered his blindly obedient followers to slaughter the inhabitants.Yes, Tarantino gets to write his own ending which unsurprisingly offers up its own share of blood and gore (and flames!), but the film is a long time getting there and in truth is much more about his trying to evoke the period and lifestyles of the characters at his disposal, mixing in the real with the imaginary. So we get vignettes of stars around at the time, some unflattering, like Bruce Lee, acting the big boss, boasting about his martial arts abilities until Pitt's Cliff puts him on his behind and the radiant Miss Tate enjoying a day out in L. A. where she takes in her own movie, the very leery-looking Dean Martin Matt Helm vehicle \"The Wrecking Crew\". There are also cameo appearances by the likes of Steve McQueen and Roman Polanski, both of whom had connections to the real-life victims that terrible night.However, it's through the invented characters of DiCaprio and Pitt that Tarantino really drives the story and gets to indulge his fascination with the era. We see DiCaprio's Dalton struggling to stop his career slide by taking parts as the \"heavy\" in a new TV western series and beefcake roles in cheap Italian movies, arranged for him by his florid new manager played by Al Pacino. Nevertheless, until his dramatic pyrotechnic entry at the climax, his character doesn't directly impact on the events leading up to the attack.That's left to Pitt's likeable sidekick character who picks up a young Manson follower and drives her back to Spohn's farm, a one-time movie-lot where the now ancient owner has let Manson and his disciples take over the place in exchange for sexual favours from one of their number. In probably the best scenes of the film, we see Pitt confronted by the zombie-like gang as he checks up on the old man in a clear harbinger of things to come.It goes without saying that Tarantino nails the reproduction of the period, with the cars, fashions, boulevards, buildings, music and in particular the pastiches of film and TV shows of the time. Rare to see a movie though, centring on the Manson Family, with nothing on the soundtrack by the Beatles, nor come to that Dylan, The Doors or Hendrix while the only Stones song inexplicably played was the then four year old \"Out Of Time\", especially when you consider that the group was well into its Satanic period by this time. Mind you, I am partial to a little Paul Revere and the Raiders from time to time.So, for me, a curate's egg of a movie. I felt it was too long, self-indulgent and over-the-top especially at the finish but the acting and cinematography was good throughout, even if I didn't detect much of the sharp dialogue I'd normally expect from Tarantino.I'll close by stating the obvious, that I do wish this alternative history was a true one...", "Great film. Tarsnuis a genius.": "I love this film. It's really accurate.\nI lived through the Sharon Tate fiasco & it's aftermaths & I remember them well. It was a horrible time.\nThanks to Mr. Tarantino & the brilliant actors.", "Hes done it again": "Im not sure where to even begin with this film, not because its in anyway bad but rather soo much to unpack. Ill admit it wasnt what i thought it was gonna be but that made it all the more a welcome surprise. While there is a undertone of the manson family it is a rather small aspect of the film atleast for the first half,infact to my recollection you only see Charlie once and very briefly. Instead the film is a tale of two friends both dealing with their own problems and demons. You have Dicaprio playing Rick Dalton an actor once famed for his starring role on 50's tv now struggling to deal with the reality of no longer being the youngest, best looking or even most talented actor around. The realisation of having to take roles he sees as below him and his deep fear that he will be forgotten to history are at the for front. He deals with this through excessive drinking and by keeping close by his best friend Cliff Booth, a stuntman (pitt) who in celebrity status is below him. Pitts character is somewhat of an enigma, an ex soldier with a murky past long suspected of having killed his own wife. He is the first to encounter the family and briefly finds himself on the ranch. The biggest thing that connects them however is proximity with Rick living next door to Sharon Tate (Robbie). The film is told in that very Tarantino way we've come to love and expect and eventually it all comes full circle and the seemingly seperate lives of the characters are all brought crashing together in a crazy, violent shocking Tarantino finale. The scripts great, the cinematography, styling everything is wonderful but for me the best component is the acting. Dicaprio is fantastic, in the moments that reveal the most we see him at his best. Conveying the pain, anguise and deep rooted insecurities that plague the character. Hes charming and hilarious aswell banking what i deem to be another oscar worthy performance. Then we have Pitt in the supporting role completly embodying the character, he oozes coolness, demands respect and at the same time delivers great comedic timing when needed. Oh and did i mention he fights Bruce Lee! The pair together was always going to be screen gold but its everything and more. Margot Robbie although not in it a ton is also very good and delivers a very pure, innocent portrayal of Tate. Overall a great watch with some story plots your be left wanted more development to. The ending is pretty full on so be aware although by now i think people know what to expect, think ending of IB or Django.", "What's new pussycat": "We watched this at home ,so therefore no cinema experience, did that spoil or increase the enjoyment .Impossible to say whether watching the nicely shot movie on the big screen would be enough compensation for making the effort and paying double jury out. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie which had slipped under my radar , in fact when it was suggested by my son I thought it was an older movie about mafia, so you will realise we are not avid cinema goers , well not covid nowadays. So we were raw I didn't even know it was QT who's movies I usually enjoy with a certain amount of confusion. And this effort didn't disappoint .Of course I know of the Manson incidents , and this movie has encouraged me to re read about the crazy goings on , but nothing I didn't know. So therefore the murder scenes at the end came as a surprise because I had questioned several times ( typical QT) what the he'll was going on . And my word it took a hell of a long tedious totally unnecessary prolonged scenes time to tell. I admit I had to check that this was in fact a fictional ending , and I was pleased with the quirky ending .I won't do , but watching with some knowledge where is was going could help, but it's nowhere near good enough to watch again and definitely good enough to recommend,unless you really really have not a lot on.The dialogue was mildly entertaining, but not up there with QT best , didn't engage with Leanardo , or the child 'actor' or the very annoying but beautiful hippy hitchhiker.Several over long boring scenes especially with the kid and the the Spahn ranch incident , it may have been more tense if I knew that the hippys were part of the Manson family.Margot Robbie looked great ,but soon went from hippy chick to 8 month pregnant yummy mummy to be a roll any good looking blond could have played.We have been to LA and Hollywood on hols but don't know enough about the place to make that interesting.5/10 because of the unexpected finale but could have been much more entertaining.", "Style over substance": "A pleasant enough way to spend a couple of hours but only if the era is interesting to you.There's very little in the way of a plot as this movie meanders it's way along. I found both the main characters fairly likeable but to be honest I was hoping there would be some point to the journey, there isn't.I'm sure QT enjoyed every minute of making this movie but it felt a bit self indulgent.If you have a couple of hours to spare it's a decent watch but it won't require your full attention.", "Once upon a time there was a story with no real plot....": "I was kind of disappointed with this one. I mean, there was some great scenes (in particular I laughed my butt off when Leo's character Rick is in his trailer crying/trying to give himself a pep talk). There is some snappy dialogue and I thought the two leads (Leo and Brad were fantastic - especially Leo). But at the same time I felt like the narrative wasn't cohesive. A lot of the film in the first 2 acts dragged me for. I was sitting in my seat and instead of being engaged in the story was wondering how much longer the movie was going to be. I was wondering where they were going with this, if it had any point. And some of the editing choices didnt make a lot of sense to me either. One of the scenes is a flashback for Brad's character's Cliff where he met and fought Bruce Lee. It is an entertaining scene and I get that it does set up how much of a bad ass Cliff is. So my problem isnt the scene itself but wouldnt it make sense to show it when Rick says \"Hey, don't bother, its being run by the same guys that did The Green Hornet\". But instead we get an extended scene of Cliff driving back to Rick's home, getting on the roof and then suddenly having the flashback. Quentin also decided on a weird characterization for Cliff. Like, they make it a point a few times that he killed his wife and got away with it. Sure, its never technically shown but it heavily implied and the character never seems to deny it either. But, I kept waiting for it to have some importance later. And it never really does. It just feels like an odd tid bit to throw in there. And especially on a character who more or less is the hero of the story.The film kind of connects itself in the third act when it goes for the revenge/fantasy part. And again, it is a really entertaining over-the-top violence kind of scene that you expect and love from a Quentin Tarantino film but again, personally its a bit too late for me. The rest of the film has entertaining stuff but lacks substance. There isnt much of a plot. Like Rick is dealing with being a fading star, the biggest thing that happens to Cliff is that he meets the Manson cult pretty early on, and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate doesnt really have much to do in the film. Like we see her walking around, watching her own movies, playing music in her house. Like, her character honestly doesnt have much else to do or say.That being said, I did also love the 60s vibes from it. I loved the nods to other movies/TV shows/actors from that time period. It did feel authentic and fun.Overall....I might have to give it a 6. I mean, its a technically well made movie. I think the story( or should I say lack of it) as well as the pacing drag it down.", "You will either love it or hate it": "This is without a doubt Tarantino' s most divisive film, you will either really enjoy this or hate it and slot of it depends on how you set your expectations. I really enjoyed it and I will tell you why.Other than seeing one trailer I had no idea what to expect from this film, absolutely nothing. We as viewers are basically getting dropped in at the tail end of Rick Daltons career and we are given a glimpse of how this affects him and his stunt double best friend Cliff. There is no real plot to this film, but its just fascinating to see these characters interactions with one another. The acting from everyone here is superb, it's nothing like Tarantino has done before but you can still see his stamp throughout.Despite the fact I had no real knowledge of the Manson Tate murders beforehand I really urge anyone who hasn't seen this film to just brush up on it. Much of this movie relies on the viewer to know what happened so by knowing these timestamps it will really add to the tension of the film 100%.Set your expectations, know what you are sitting down to see and I think you will get alot out of this film. The last 25 minutes are some of the most brutal violence i have ever seen in cinema, worth the admission fee alone", "Best from Tarantino in a while": "I really liked it. Again manipulating history, but one that I liked. Shot on 16mm-Imax-8k megafilm and Tarantino doesn't forget to tell you about that. But still. This was a really good movie after all the other ones afer Jackie Brown. Tarantino is over-rated these days, but once in a while he surprises us.", "Brief review of a long film": "Relive the sixties.\nAcid dipped cig trip. Quentin\nLikes feet, hates hippies", "Just don't waste your time (almost three hours) watching this": "To be honest I think Tarantino hasn't been making good movies for a long time by now, but a friend who I trust when it's about movies reviews told me it was worth watching. Well it's not. But luckily I realized that early enough to save almost two hours of my time.", "was expecting so much more.. this is a non-event": "I had just watched \"The Irishman\" and was on such a high from that spectacular movie... I thought I'd watch QT's new flick to top off a great week..well. the two movies could not possible be in more divergent leagues than they are...QT's Once upon a time is boring. nothing actually happens!! 3 and a half hours of what? for what? only in the last 10mins something happens.the actors are all good, it's just the script.. boring as bat-sh!t.. everyone is going to watch this anyway and that's fine, do it.. it will deservedly tarnish their idea of QT.once upon a time there was a director named Quentin Tarantino.. he got too big for his own boots and thought he was the best in hollywood. he was and he fell from a great height.", "Be prepared to be drown in boredom": "As a big Quentin Tarantino fan who loved 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Kill Bill', I went to watch this movie with high expectation (bad idea). Nevertheless, its was a succulent treat for a movie enthusiast like me to see Dicaprio and Brad Pitt together. But I had to come out with a heavy heart saying, I almost fell asleep out of boredom. However, the climax was short lived but enjoyable. Some scenes seemed unnecessary to the story line so were most dialogues.\nI placed two stars for great acting skills from Dicaprio, one person that never disappoints. His career struggle, self actualisation on his own and brilliant dialogue delivery throughout the entire movie probably the only thing that kept me awake for that 2 hours 40 minutes screen time. So folks, be prepared to be bored!\nBest of luck for Tarantino next time, I haven't lost hope. I am sure he will bring back great cinemas once again, just like good old times.", "He hit me...and it felt like a kiss.": "QT films a love letter to analog Hollywood serenading the unsung could have/has been heroes of the Industry while backhanding armchair politicians with his meta-as-*u*k-Easter egg laden narrative replete with characters kissed by preternatural powers of self-effacing, hyper-reflexivity navigating a near-woke, PC revisionist dreamscape the #meetoo #oscarssowhite contingent can digest without immediately pulling out their phones in a packed and darkened theatre to snap a selfie of them throwing up in a ONCE UPON A TIME IN...HOLLYWOOD screening.I appreciate QT particularly going out of his way to celebrate Los Angeles' historic establishments and the diversity of people responsible for supporting and nourishing the Industry throughout its evolution *I type this even as I wait to be *itch-slapped offscreen and set the timer for critical #lgbtqiainclusivity Op-Eds*\n...All of Hollywood is a stage and everyone has an integral role to play whether you're the Chicano waiter at El Coyote or an Everyman bartender at Musso & Frank's, a disembodied crew member in heels booking it to your call-time, a kind theatre manager like Obet Maldonado at the Bruin, an undervalued Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, a demi-dimensional, starlet with aspirations so bright you're a North Star for the lost with no direction of their own...everyone in Hollywood conspires to light a fire with the lumens to burn off the darkness and absorb life's worst blows.\nI never thought I'd see the Vogue a-glow nor the Tomkat theatre *before his transition*.", "I stand corrected": "Having an ax to grind against Quentin Tarantino for various reasons, I never thought he'd make a movie this good. Once Upon A Time in Hollywood seems less loved by his core fans, which really surprises me! I'm not a fan, and consider this not only his best film, but also an instant classic, go figure.Does any more really needs to be said about this film at IMDB? Very little likely, with over 4500 reviews. I'd also guess that 90% of the eyes that hit this review have already seen the movie. However, if you are in the minority, and wonder if you should watch this film? Yes!!! Absolutely.You will not see a better produced film in the modern era, perhaps outside of some Christopher Nolan films. The production quality is magnificent and fully earned the Academy Award. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is also a very clever film. All the content wraps around itself in ways that is very fun to think about after watching the movie. It's the first Tarantino film where I thought the violence was completely, thematically justified. It's also the first Tarantino film he didn't mare by casting himself in a major role and scene (thank you). Technically Tarantino also wasn't in True Romance, but this is a film he wrote, but did not direct.To a cynic, this movie is would be the better part of 2 hours of exposition, then about 40 good minutes of Tarantino to finish it off. I hate that interpretation. Most of the gold in this film is early on. There is no exposition. The ending is an amazing payoff to how the movie opens and evolves - exactly how it should be in top tier film making. Honestly - how many times have you seen a movie with an amazing first act, average second, and shit third? It happens all the time! For a movie to start this good, then end better? It's just great film making, and perhaps something I never really appreciated about Tarantino films. They are complete, and his third acts are often the strongest of the three.Not to mention the likable nature of the two main characters, which is absolutely new to me in a Tarantino film. Textured characters? sure. Interesting characters? you betcha! But Likable characters? No way - Tarantino films are generally so packed with unlikable characters, It's a wonder I get through them at all! This is often a deal breaker for me regarding film, tv, books, short stories. I have to root for someone. I have to want to see their story unfold. This has Nothing to do with characters ethics or worldview, simply, are they likeable?In this case yes! They are fun, interesting, dangerous and full of great dialog. And about that dialog. By Tarantino standards it is very spare. The grandstanding and diatribes are where they should be, and everywhere else the dialog moves wonderfully with the pace of the film. Other Tarantino films, Inglorious Bastards comes to mind, have scenes so bloated with dialog, the viewer can actually forget the context of the scene! The who, what, when, where, why. That isn't a good thing! To me, it was the biggest barrier between Tarantino making a classic film like many of Sergio Leone's films. Sergio understood silences and spare use of dialog, and I always felt Tarantino wanted to be Sergio, but also wanted to flaunt his greatest talent, writing. I think Tarantino found the correct balance in this film, and at this stage of his career, to make this huge change in approach is admirable.I consider it a great film, and my favorite moments have to be the cut-away scenes and moments were we see the main character in TV shows and Movies. The violence in these scenes is truly hilarious, and builds into a greater part of the movies theme. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood basically asks questions about media violence, and so completely smashes any culpability/responsibility (though content) - it basically visually slaps around anyone who thinks media violence is responsible for anything in reality. And I Love It. But I'm digging deep here, intentionally, to attempt to get at some of the magic of this movie. There's a Lot going on here to be analyzed, thought about, enjoyed. Just like Brad Pitt's character who's stuntman presence is implied in the movies and TV shows, there is a lot of invisible content throughout this movie.Including acting - And I think this might be Dicaprio's best movie. And I am a huge fan of his ever since Blood Diamond. Pitt is perfect in his role, but really? That role didn't require a ton of dynamic range. However, it shouldn't be devalued to be perfectly cast, and deliver a perfect performance. The point I really wanted to make about the acting is how complex it gets at times. More than once Dicaprio is acting in a scene about acting (generically speaking), while going through the mannerisms of an actor... all while in character. From both a direction, and acting perspective, you have to understand these moments so clearly yourself, but then also have to be on the same page as all the other creative performers on set for this to work. It's quite the dance, and watching these meta scenes is pure magic.There's an old film making technique where you cast an average actor into a bit role opposite the lead, in order to make the lead actor's performance look better, and stand out. You see it a lot in 40's and 50's movies. You'll also see it in this film. I'm actually a big fan of the TV actor who played this small role, and it was nice to see him in this movie.I've stressed a lot of the details, while leaving out the general nature of the movie - and perhaps that makes for an uncertain review. But don't get me wrong. Entertainment is in my opinion the first priority of film. Without which, any extra sauce might as well just be mayonnaise. And Once Upon a Time in Hollywood delivers fabulous entertainment. But it isn't (simply) a single viewing experience. It is a movie that holds up to multiple viewings, and (I would guess) will age very, very well... not unlike it's two leads.9/10 but I'm not sure why I'm not giving it a 10/10 - if I figure that out, perhaps I'll revisit this review.", "He's only gone and done it again...": "Quintin Tarantino has, once again put together a masterful piece of Hollywood directing and writing. This film is based around the lives of 3 different characters, Dick Dalton a \"waste-away\" western star, Cliff his stunt double and the late famous Sharon Tate. In true Tarantino style these 3 storylines run superbly both individually and in synchronisation of each other to create a fascinating piece of screen play.\nBefore watching I didn't have much knowledge around who Sharon Tate was other than a man named Charles Manson was involved in her death. This left me leaving the cinema with an abundance of questions. However, these answered themselves when I thought back on the subtle, potentially out of context scenes within the film. Such as the man in the ice cream truck who turns up at Sharon Tate's house (obviously Charles Manson himself) . Nonetheless, I soon realised that this was just Tarantino at his very finest, leaving clues to the final plot scattered throughout his film. Once Upon a time in Hollywood ultimately outlines the fantasy of an awful turn of events which occurred on the night of August 8th 1969, and in my opinion, Quintin Tarantino has magnificently payed homage to this.", "One of Tarantino's worst!": "2hrs of going no-where, for 10 minutes of Tarantino madness at the end. About sums this up.", "Not what I expected": "Im not sure what I expected, this seemed more like a leo acting reel (which is fine) but without him and pitt im not sure how good this movie would have been. People complaining about multiple story lines, its tarantino, you should have stayed home. I love tarantino's flicks but this is down there with deathproof. It has its moments, hell ill watch it a few more times when it comes out. But its one of those movies ill play when im trying to fall asleep for work. I tech gave this a 7.8 imo. The climax was not worth the wait. No hating here just my honest opinion of the flick. Great acting by everyone in the movie, even the nobodies.", "Good, but could be SO much better": "I came into this movie hoping for the next Pulp Fiction, and frankly, it didn't live up to that. While I did enjoy the movie, and two characters in particular, I felt that there were parts where the plot turned on it's head in a very unsatisfying way. The premise was very exciting, and I got the feeling that the ending would bring a number of briefly mentioned elements into a brilliant conclusion, but these plot threads were left to dangle. I almost feel like if I had watched the first half of the movie and been asked to write the second, I could have made it much better. I expected more from Tarantino, but it was still a movie worth watching.", "Satisfactory ending": "I love the detailed dive into each character's psyche, making us feel so much closer to each of them - and then the interweaving of their fates in the thunderous finale. This movie did not disappoint. Should be an 8.5 stars in my books if there was the option. I love the performances from each actor. Perhaps a little too many meandering drives from the rear seat for me, and I only understood the movie fully after I googled and found out the backstory (a particular disadvantage as a young-ish person, I guess).", "Complete failure": "I just didn't get the idea of the movie and what the last 10 mins ? Why it became the terminator suddenly\nWhy to spend 2 h on complete b.s.", "Utterly boring and went nowhere": "I have to say out of all the QT movies this has to be the most boring with a pointless plot. Credit has to go to the dog who held his own among some huge stars. A few attempts at humour which failed miserably. Al Pacino, well what on earth was he doing, apart from looking like he was desperate (in the 2 minutes screen time he had) to scream like he usually does, the salary probably kept him quiet though. What was really good was the sense of being in the sixties which was done really well with much attention to detail. The chemestry between Pitt and DeCaprio was non existent and you never ever got the feeling they were an actor and a stunt man, it just didn't work in the plot. You knew there was going to be a violent ending like every other QT movie but half eaten by an American Pit Bull, half beaten to death,stabbed, hit with a flame thrower and almost drown you would think the screaming girl would have stopped screaming long before it totally got on your nerves. A movie never to be seen again in my opinion.", "Pure art, but not for everyone": "QT did an amazing job with the dialogues and the characters; however, many people would feel the movie doesn't have a purpose and make the audience wonder where is this going? But like pulp fiction, it's just a movie to enjoy without thinking about the plot or the purpose of the story. The more you think about this movie, the more you would like it, and the final scene was totally worth it.", "Just for the cast": "I don't get Tarantino's movies. What's the point of making this and saying this is cinema. Rating is for the actors only.", "Recycled": "Like being on long-haul flight 'Once upon a time' gradually erases the past and a sense of purpose inside a compressed space where the inflight movie consists of tracking shots of 50 year old cars on LA freeways with contemporary pop music. In between, the dramatic action is provided by actors who cruise, chew the fat, and utter prosaic lines in a knowing way.It's then you wished you'd packed some good books, for example, books on cinema, semiotics and pop culture because it borrows, poaches and re-uses ideas and tropes which have been employed elsewhere and always in more incisive ways.The era is observed through a Warholian gaze of banality: the TV shows, the songs, the mundane utterances of no interest, which are crafted like TV adverts i.e. a dumb slogan or assertion. Bereft of creative ideas the only strategy is to repeat, and once scaled up, the entire fraud almost resembles something like another better film.People driving cars are not inherently interesting, nor are their faces, not even with the winking use of a song over the image. Do it over and over, pastiche the era, and perhaps it's a style. Or not.In any case, it's a trick any film school neophyte can do and upload. And pastiche is something any artist can do before they generate the real work. Mannerists do this: take a previous idea and echo it with minor nuances, strive for an ironic mode because that looks clever. It does to the perpetrator, anyway, though the audience has already seen the con.Al Pacino said in a recent interview that he does bad movies in the hope that they might lift and, at the very least, become mediocre. With this movie he may have attained that goal, though that is no concession, or pleasure, for the rest of us.", "Watchable..": "..but also absolutely forgettable *yawn* A boring movie about boring movies that noone remembers or cares about, and I'm not even from the youngest audience. This won two oscars, what the heck for?? Just confirms that oscars are overrated or the jury consists of a bunch of boomers who love themselves some \"good old days\" nostalgia..", "Long, boring and pointless": "I don't understand the hype. This movie was so bland and dull that i can't trust Tarantino anymore. The only movie of him that i liked was Inglorious Basterds. Other than that, almost all were mediocre, but still watchable. But, tbh this may be his worst movie. It's style over substance. It's dragged for 160 mins (more than 2.5hr) and we wait for nothing.So, I went last night with my Grandpa, as he was amazed to see the movie, out of nostalgia. He did enjoy it, as he found many things relatable. I too believed in the hype and big star cast(DiCaprio, Brad pitt, Margot Robbie). But, meh my money got wasted. Brad Pitt is the only one who carries the film on his shoulders. Although, I'm a big fan of DiCaprio, he sucks in this movie. His role was meaningless. The whole movie you'll get cultural and pop references to the 60s era and most of them were accurate but the problem is that the pace is too slow to keep up with the story, which itself is crap. This follows the traditional style of AMERICAN STEREOTYPE, by showing asians in bad light. That bruce lee x brad pitt fight scene literally irritated me. At least show some respect to him. As per tarantino, every american is strong, powerful and messiah and asians are dumb, crap and freaks. I literally got irritated and bored, until the ending came, with traditional Tarantino style action fighting, the thing most of the people in the theater were waiting for.Anyways, one star coz my Grandpa enjoyed it and one star for the ending.", "Underwhelmed Overstayed Overpaid Overall Crap": "Don't buy into this. Not QT's best...one of his worst. Rambling, long, boring, waiting for anything to happen...some fun little teasers here and there to spark interest but overall BAD. If you are looking at a true account of the Tate/Manson Family murders this is not it-2hours and 53 minutes of boring.", "Once you overcome the challenges, you can reap the rewards": "This film is a challenge to watch, but once you overcome those challenges, you can reap the rewards of what is a great film. It takes you on a journey through the golden era of film, following all the ups and downs of life back then. The film is expertly crafted and presented in a way that is only made possible by Quentin Tarantino.The end of the film will not disappoint: hilarious yet shocking in equal measure. Whatever you think of this movie before you watch it, your opinions will be turned on their head by the time the end credits are rolling.", "Once upon a time QT": "Once upon a time QT was great. I haven't missed any of his films. Recall him saying that he would never marry cause he doesn't want to be distracted and wants to keep creating masterpieces. Well, QT, maybe it's time for you to start dating and get married. Cause except for the last 30 minutes this movie was just a waste of my time. I'd give credit for recreating atmosphere of the 70ies, attire, cars etc. But that's about it.", "Watchable but very boring \"documentary\"": "I really like \"old\" Tarantino movies but this one is very boring. It feels you're watching a documentary or small homage to the old Hollywood. There is no content or a real story line. After 1.5 hours you're gonna ask yourself what exactly is this movie about? I'm not expecting one action scene after another or joke after joke but at least something you can follow.", "The best Tarantino movie": "I love every tarantino movie but this is by far the best. it's funny. it's violent. it's fun. i like his movies like django but i prefer the fun ones like this vs westerns. i love the casting, i mean cmon: leonardo dicaprio, brad pitt, margot robbie, luke perry and al pacino! the sound track is amazing, i especially love the songs brother love's traveling salvation show and hush. now to the plot, rick dalton (mr dicaprio's character) is an actor. he has a stunt double cliff booth (mr pitt). rick can get very discouraged because, well he's not the biggest actor. there is sharon tate (played by mrs robbie) makes a lot of appearances however she's not a huge part. they live in hollywood in the 60s. rick living in a nice hollywood hills house, cliff living in a trailer and sharon being rick's neighbor. it's so enjoyable i recommend! it's even better the second time so if you didn't like it, give it another chance.", "Tarantino's Love Letter to Hollywood": "This was just such a phenomenal experience for anyone who can deal with type of pacing that Tarantino is known for. It's not quite the nonlinear approach he normally takes but it does go down some fun rabbit holes exploring old Hollywood.The world building is top notch. You get to see the old projects that Rick Dalton (Leo's character) has worked on and roles he almost had which are fun nods to Quentin's previous work and films he presumably grew up loving.One scene I really loved was when Rick and Cliff come home and Rick talks about owning land in Hollywood and how the town may move on from you but you still own a piece of the town and no matter what they can't take that from you.On top of it being a good period piece, it also provides a relatively realistic look at what it's probably like to be an aging star in Hollywood. How you can be on top of the game being the lead on a popular show then 8 years later you are working guest spots as the bad guy of the week.Overall it was a masterful demonstration of storytelling and acting to come together and take you out of your life for nearly 3 hours.I have been looking forward to this movie for so long and it delivered on every level. I was not disappointed in the least bit.", "Tarantino made me to go to the theathre but...": "I went to see this movie today, I do not go very often because nowadays cinema is full of loudy and disrespectful people. But Tarantino worts it. The movie is dragged in a very slow pace I mean: A LOT! There are a lot of slow scenes, like a lot of car driving scenes and nothing happening, some music, did not develop nothing, there are some good dialogues but just that. Some goofs like Bruce Lee speaking and a crowd listening than, suddenly no one is around, I just thought: \"where did everyone went?\" It is about 2 hours of nothing developing, but the final is good, it is when everything really happens. However, other goofs.\n1- Cliff went away with dog crosses those hippies, than Dalton gets upset and yells to those hippies in that noisy car, hippies go away.\n2 - suddenly Cliff is in Dalton's house which he left minutes ago and hippies appears there. Again to kill them.\n3 - why cliff was there? Why there was dog food in Dalton's house if Dalton does not have a dog?\nDespite those goofs, the scene is a tarantino scene. Good and violent and worths the 2 hours of nothing happening.\nEveryone would wish that Manson's guys would entered in a wrong house, with some bad asses like that. And that is the most sad and breath taking moment of the movie. Because we know what really happened there.Also I think it is some of Tarantino's protest about our new generation thinking about love, peace like hippies and at the end they just want violence. It is clear in the ranch when Cliff faces everyone.", "Compromised by factual links": "There were some very funny moments including the canine capers and also Pitt & DiCaprio are a great pairing. But I felt that linking the story to a factual crime compromised this work. What could have been a much shorter and soaring tale of pure imagination was hampered and brought somewhat clumsily down to earth by pinning on to it elements of true life.This is the second film I have seen recently (Transit was the other one) which is blighted by narration.The excellent sound track (Neal Diamond and the Stones were my favourites) failed to lift this to an above average Tarantino outing.", "Best part was when it ended": "Oh wait, I didn't see the end as I walked out after 2 hours of a snore fest.", "Thescript is a mess": "It's a very messy script, likely the reason for tihs is that Tarantino expects its audience to know the time period. The movies, the actors that played them at the time etc. etc.\nFor most, including myself, I dont think that's the case and it results in a script that is hard to follow, doesnt have a clear narrative, and characters are all over the place without much character growth.\nThe good? The acting, and production are top notch with an equal cast. It's just not enough to warrant this a good rating (8).", "Tarantino's First Comedy?": "1st, this was my first Alamo Drafthouse experience, opening night, which may skew my opinion because that was such a great viewing with the opening 30min vignette they added prior to showtime.\nThis movie was really excellent. Like many of Tarantino's recent films, nothing happens until something happens at the very end, but like Seinfeld there is brilliance and masterful scripting during the meandering first 9/10ths of the film.\nI didn't think Brad Pitt could look cooler, but Tarantino made him the god that even heteros like me find ourselves attracted to like a cult leader or David Bowie.\nDiCaprio gives a brilliant performance as well as the washed up western star.\nThe score may be one of the best in Tarantino's career which says a ton.\nThe final tenth of the film is a feast of classic stunt gags pushed to the nth degree.\nThis is a must see film. I wouldn't say it is Tarantino's best, but his worst (not sure which that one is... Kill Bill vol 2... maybe?) Is still better than most other movies. This is a step down from The Hateful 8 for me, but still thoroughly enjoying. I'll be watching it again without doubt.", "Not a fan....": "Normally I would have watch this film when it was first released ...being a Taratino and Pit fan. But I waited because DiCaprio was in it and I usually dont care for his work. With the exception of Blood Diamond and this film. By far much better acting than Pitt( won Oscar for this role) and even better than The Revenant..the film on the other hand was disappointing. Not only did it lack the extreme violence that I'm used to seeing in a Taratino movie but it was so slow and far too long. He spent way too much time developing these characters...10 minutes in we already got it!! Why spend another 90 minutes!!! Hopefully his next will be better!", "What did I even watch?": "If you feel like watching people drive around for a few hours this movie is perfect for you. It got mildly interesting when Cliff visited the Manson family. They build up all this suspense like he's about to stumble across something, but then he just talks to a senile old man and leaves.\nThere are rumors in the movie that Cliff killed his wife, but you never find out if it's true. They have one flash back to him and his wife arguing on a boat and then nothing else.\nThere is no plot. You just watch some self-absorbed people eating, talking, and driving. The whole movie you think something is about to happen...but it never does.", "I saw no story no progression": "There is no story just events that leads to nothing.\nNo memorabel scene.\nLittle dissapointed. Good Photo, some namedropping.\nIts a Hollywood history rewrite. Its a good handcraft so its worth a view on tv. Once.", "About as impressive a film as I've ever seen": "Easily the best film I've seen this year. The first three quarters or so are hard to believe. What it must have taken to attain this level of artistry! Tarantino's eye and taste are as good as it gets. This is the last I guy I want to see retire. I'm sure there are old time studio heads turning over in their graves in sheer envy.Both DiCaprio and Pitt turn in wonderful performances, DiCaprio more a character part than Pitt's but both instill every frame with star power. It's hard to walk out of the theater and not feel the uplifting influence of Brad Pitt. And then there's Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate who's like a cool breeze on a hot day, a physical relief to watch.The last quarter, Tarantino makes a personal statement about the period and some of the atrocities it saw. He's been criticized for meddling with history but there's something utterly understandable and laudable about the choices he's made. I wouldn't change a thing. I'd be surprised if this film didn't win every award it comes up for.", "From the best movies in the decade !": "It was fantastic , I wish that I can watch it again", "Perfect Tarantino": "People who don't like this movie must not care for Tarantino. His style is unique and understated, up until it hits the fan. The first two hours are not slow or boring. It's everything you love about Hollywood in the 60s, with perfectly parsed out character development and foreshadowing, followed up by incredibly satisfying gratuitous violence that rewrites history. I was hesitant to watch this film because I knew Sharon Tate and her baby and her friends' terribly sad fate. But Tarantino grants the viewers their fairy tale ending, with justice for the evil and life for the characters we've grown attached to throughout the film. And speaking of the characters, Pitt, Robbie, and DiCaprio each hit it out of the park - not to mention the huge supporting cast. I think this is my new favorite Tarantino film.", "boring, unclear, complicated, funny, cool": "This movie is very annoying and unclear to me. Maybe because it is about too old times, maybe because I do not like drama genre or too much talk, maybe because it requires knowledge of various film industry keywords and concepts. Everything is somehow too random, disconnected, unrelated. The story has no beginning nor ending. Characters are annoying, especially girls. As if they are behaving specific to some culture, nation, or century, something too difficult to understand and like. But good are the actions parts, which is about 3 action stories total afaik. Best is the Brad Pitt, just like in other movies. He is funny, creative, cool, normal, and has courage. Bit worse is Leonardo DiCaprio, just like I do not like him in other movies. So, only those few small funny and action moments is what makes this movie not the worst. And the presence of Brad and Leonardo, 2 most famous actors, together in one movie. This is probably best for older people and film industry experienced people.", "Review #1": "Amazing. Acting. Cinematography. Editing. Everything is just amazing.", "This was by far the worst Tarantino movie ever": "All i have to say is where did it start and where did it end? It was complete chaos and drivel driven by lunacy. There was really no plot or sustenance to this at all.", "Horrible Movie": "So many scenes that added nothing to a story. Could not tell what the story was about. The plot was missing from the beginning. Waste of movie making time and money. First time in a long time that I walked out of a movie. Don't waste your time or money. Just plain bad.", "8 for the eyes, 0 for the brain = 4 points": "The cinematography was very nice, but the story was really boring. The guy next to me slept for 20 minuten and missed nothing.

In Hollywood is a lot of fun and had me laughing and completely engrossed for the entire run-time. The characters of Once Upon a Time are vividly colorful full of exciting and diverse backgrounds and side plots, as are the characters of Pulp Fiction. Tarantino fans may find some of the twists and style choices predictable, but not exhausted.My friends who knew nothing about the Manson murders missed out on a lot of the suspense, but said they still really enjoyed the film. I am in my late 20's so I missed out on some of the history of the movie-stars, but I don't think this was significant.Overall loved it and I am likely to see this film many more times :)", "Cool, but poorly developed plot and character chemistry": "Nice shots and atmosphere, especially of the cars (one of which has to be one of the most menacing in movie history). But the story feels too fragmented and without much development. And there's little trace of Tarantino's trademark gradually increasing tension. Instead there's a lot of people watching movies.Fiction and real-life are mixed, but don't really blend together. The Sharon Tate plot feels separate from the rest, and Rick and Cliff are just witnesses to this plot and never really engaging with it. Even our dynamic duo mostly acts on their own. I miss the cooperation, chemistry and dialogue like Vincent and Jules had in Pulp Fiction. There's one scene where they comment a show together though, Beavis & Butthead style. Strange, but I'll take it.The characters: Pitt is playing his coolest looking Robert Redford type character ever. He has a promising backstory, but it never plays out properly. And slick Leo never convinces me as an struggling cowboy actor from that era. He looks too contemporary and isn't interesting enough as an actor to play this character.This is probably a film that's enjoyed fully if you're a old-school Hollywood fan and want to see it recreated, because the story, style and characters alone aren't that satisfying.", "A BUDDY MOVIE IN DISGUISE": "De Caprio and Pitt make a good team in the middle of a wild trip down memory lane.

But 30 minutes in I was beyond annoyed. By minute 60 I debated leaving, by minute 90 I wanted everyone in the movie to die, and by minute 120 I wanted to die for not leaving.The last 45 minutes did not make up for the first two hours of gratuitous cinematic references that advanced the plot line at a maddeningly slow and inconsistent pace.I love cinematography, but this movie goes way beyond appreciation and beats the art to death.", "Wonderful, simply wonderful": "I don't remember laughing out loud so much in a movie. The twist, if it can be called that, at the end is phenomenal. I think the tension that built up throughout the movie explodes out of moviegoers in the last minutes due to an ending that is unexpected and brilliant.Pitt, DeCaprio and Robbie are wonderful. This film deserves Oscars.", "Slow unlike his previous films and an homage to Sharon Tate": "I have seen the previous 8 Tarantino films and he always has A actors in them. I thought I was going to like this one but it was painfully slow and with no sense at all. The acting was great, cinematography too, there were funny scenes including one with a guy playing Bruce Lee (this event never happened in real life) and fans of Lee might be outraged and laugh at the same time with this unreal but funny scene.\nThe last minutes of the film were really a Tarantino movie with some of the gore and violence that\u00b4s been in his previous movies (I am not a fan of gory nor violent movies at all, but I find QT\u00b4s funny and quite different).\nit seems OUATIH was made because of his love and nostalgia to good old films from the 60s and 70s and for the ending, he created a timeline on the Sharon Tate fate because I assume, he wanted to do an homage to Sharon and the other unfortunate victims.", "Not Tarantino's best work ! But still a really good movie ..": "First off this movie won't be made if DiCaprio and Pitt wouldn't have commited to play in it . That being said if you want to see amazing acting display , amazing script , amazing dialogues then go for it . This movie is a must in 2019 cause after watching all the super hero movies and cgi stuff this movie brings the audience back to earth and shows us the true talent of the best actors in the business right now Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. I have to say both of them were amazing but for me Brad Pitt was really fun to watch especially his action scenes .", "Excellent film": "Quentin Tarrantino does it again, great script and direction.

Still, this movie is something special.", "An excellent nostalgic movie with a very nice what if....": "I watched this movie while friends and family did not enjoy it! To be honest, it would be a waste not to at least attempt to watch a film with Pitt and DiCaprio and of course a bit of Al Pacino.I've watched all of Tarantino's movies, I actually grew up with them. He had some mediocre or even bad ones, and of course some that epitomised cinematography.So, once upon a time...in Hollywood is a movie with top notch perfomances, a script that is peculiar but is perceived as in everyday life, i.e. not a story until it becomes one.I think it is one of Tarantino's best movies", "Betrayal to the memory": "This film is beyond offensive. This film used real people and real stories and completely belittled their memories. Bruce Lee comes across as a talent-less jackass and the Manson clan comes across as weak and ill-prepared.

This film is an embarrassment.", "The Big Nothing": "Let me start by saying that I love movies where the focus of the movie is the dialogue, like Pulp Fiction or The Big Lebowski or Fear And Loathing. Those kinds of movies are my favorites because they are unpredictable and the plot. This is the most pretentious boring pointless film I've ever seen. I hate this film with a passion. Nothing noteworthy happens in it. It was described in the description as a comedy drama but I didn't find anything in this film that made me chuckle. This is a case of the Emperors New Clothes. No one wants to look dumb by pointing it out so I'll do it. The emperor is naked he's not wearing anything; this movie is a pathetic excuse for a film that should be collecting dust in a bargain bin it's done nothing that is Oscar worthy but it's done plenty that is Razzie worthy. I came here to vent my frustrations but there really is nothing to be said because nothing happened...", "A different yet still enjoyable side of Tarantino": "Not as violent as other Tarantino's but equally enjoyable.

There are 2 big points in the movie. The first and smaller one being Leonardo's character,Rick Daulton, is so stressed and depressed because he wants to be more than just the villain of the movie, he feels he isn't good enough to be the main character and that's what is really messing with him. In one of the scenes Rick says \"i'm one pool party away from being big\" and the ending of the movie shows that's exactly what happens. The second story being Cliff. I believe this story is about him in a way. He is a Stunt Double and nobody pays respect to stunt doubles. Throughout the movie he is shown as being dragged around by Rick and being used to do his work that Rick doesn't want to do, at the end Cliff fights off 3 killers,which was amazing, and kills 2 and left the other one blind and injured badly which Rick ends up finishing, but Cliff doesn't get any recognition. He does all the dirty work but all he gets is Rick saying he's a good friend. It shows that Stunt doubles do all the dirty work but the person who gets the recognition is the actor, when in reality they don't do anything.This movie is amazing and the only reason I gave it a 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because Tarintino is always my favorite and I don't wanna be biased.", "Tarantino's Magnum Opus, A Tribute To Hollywood, About Hollywood Done As Only QT Could": "Quentin Tarantino has always demonstrated a strong love for the art of film making. It isn't just a love for the industry or the culture, but for the medium itself, the stories it tells, and the way in which it's done. His films are full of tiny Easter eggs, homages, and call backs to films of yesteryear that have, in a sense, defined his specific style. Some find this off putting, going so far as to criticize him for doing nothing but aping other auteurs. But, by and large, Tarantino is considered one of the defining indie filmmakers standing as a tentpole of cinematic artists. It seems, then, that he is past due for a film that truly defines him and what his work means, and it's hard to argue that this film isn't that. A loving tribute to, at least by appearances, Quentin's most beloved era of film making, this is maybe the quintessential Tarantino film, even if it doesn't exactly bear repeat viewings.More in line with something like Pulp Fiction, Once Upon A Time, taking place in 1969, follows actor Rick Dalton, as played by Leonardo DiCaprio, his stuntman and all around confidant Cliff Booth, as played by Brad Pitt, and to a somewhat lesser extent Sharon Tate, the famous real life actress killed by the Manson family in 1969 as played by Margot Robbie. Each actor brings their best here, with DiCaprio back to his somewhat emotionally vulnerable and slightly unhinged form, while Pitt plays off him as cool, with swagger to spare, aggression, and even some slight bursts of violence. Robbie, who is disconnected from the two for pretty much the entirety of the film, counters the two old timers seeing their time in Hollywood sunset as Sharon, a starlet who is still seeing Hollywood through rose colored lenses and smiles wide at herself on screen and basks in the glow of a budding career. Supporting all three is a wide cast of cameos and guest spots, many of which are Tarantino regulars, including Kurt Russell, Zoe Bell, and Michael Madsen, while a handful of new actors to Tarantinon's repertoire join in, like Timothy Olyphant, Al Pacino, and Dakota Fanning.When Tarantino says this is a love letter to Hollywood, it isn't simply that he wants to tell a story about Hollywood from this period. It's that he wants to recreate a Hollywood of yesterday. There are long swathes of time where we spend time travelling with our characters, taking in all of the old businesses that once lined the streets of Hollywood, or listening to the music of the era. This isn't just about Hollywood as a business, but as a culture, as a geographical point in Los Angeles. It's about the entirety of Hollywood and a point of time it existed in, as well as the transition to the next phase of Hollywood. Tarantino makes an interesting choice in choosing to focus, in part, on Sharon Tate, but when put up against Rick and Cliff, it makes sense. Rick and Cliff are the old timers coming to terms with their fading careers, with Rick especially having a difficult time dealing with the fact that he may very well be in the last throes of his spotlight. Conversely, Sharon, the young starlet begins her career at the entrance of a new time period. And while much has been made about the involvement of the Manson family in the film, in reality their inclusion feels more symbolic than a core part of the film. While the finale of the film is fairly crazy and maybe the most Tarantino-esque part of it, like reality in which the Manson family murders were considered a definitive end to 60's Hollywood and the beginning of New Hollywood, here they act as a thematic transition for our characters from one era of Hollywood to the next.While this is very much a Tarantino film, this is QT at his most thoughtful and contemplative. Perhaps he has put much of himself in the film, a film maker who has been making movies for nearly 30 years and is now planning to call it quits on big time movies. The film isn't littered with snappy dialogue, pop culture references, or even long bouts of dialogue exchange like we're used to. The pop culture exchanges typical of his movie seem to encompass the entire thing. We might normally see the Manson family become a one off gag. Here, it becomes an intrinsic part of the film. Make no mistake, the script is still excellent, as is the production itself, which gives us scenes from fake movies and TV shows that feel every bit like they belong in productions from the 50's and 60's. But it all feels like it's a much more natural and thoughtful part of the film than it is a gag thrown in for the sake of being in the film. These characters all feel real, like the kind of people Tarantino might look up to from a bygone era, rather than wanting to create for his own personal enjoyment. This isn't just Tarantino trying to entertain us, pay homage to scenes from movies, or have fun behind the camera. This is Tarantino trying to pay respect to the Hollywood he loves. As such, this feels like something more personal. Don't take that too seriously, though. This is still a very funny movie with plenty of fun inside.If QT were to truly say goodbye to film making today, this would feel like an appropriate farewell. He pours a lot of love in what we see on screen, and more so than maybe any film, this feels especially personal to him. It's a tribute to everything Hollywood during a time when Hollywood was to change radically. If Reservoir Dogs marks Tarantino's dramatic entrance into Hollywood as one of its best indie directors, Once Upon A Time may stand as the kind of exit that only Tarantino could make.", "Just can't leave well-enough alone.": "There ain't no history like a Tarantino history, cause a Tarantino history is \"history plus!\"\nMuch like the sinking of the Titanic (one of the most tragic, horrible and dramatic events of modern history, with great loss of life) just wasn't quite \"zingy\" enough until James Cameron tweaked it into screen-worthiness with his corny little touches and plot points, Tarantino can take ho-hum. Silly events (like Hitler's extermination of a race and The Manson Murders) and use his special talent to just kick it up a notch to the point of being noteworthy and attention-getting, all praise Quinton! It was all just a little spare on interest until he added his special ju ne sais quoi, his touch. Lord knows, his \"improved\" versions are superior, the way things really should have gone down. He's like a child saying \"If I'd ever gotten my hands on Hitler I'd have shown him what-for.\" or \"Charlie Manson wouldn't have killed me! I'd have gotten my flame thrower and turned him into a marshmallow.\"\nAt least there's no confusion about the fact that it's an alternative take, a Tarantino take, but real history is inviolable, and my concern is still that there's a price to pay in credibility when you mess with the truth.\nI found it quite ironic that mention is made of Disney, calling him a genius, he himself a great meddler with history and a story or two.", "Tarantino Presents a Spaghetti Western": "This film is a time machine, sending the audience back to the 1960s with every aspect. The visuals, the music, the historical events, and unfortunately the pacing as well. While the first few landed well, and the movie was generally enjoyable, the pacing suffered from the overindulgent wallowing in a period piece that Tarantino seems to love. Aging movie star, Rick Dalton and his stunt double, cross paths with his famous neighbors, a group of hippies, and eventually a man with murderous intent. The plots have seemingly no connection to one another, nor is there a clear direction for the story to head in initially. In a way, this is pleasant, as it allows the viewer to be surprised by the events, rather than living in what is going to happen next by linear progression. In the end, this movie does meet the TGS: Tarantino Gore Standard. A movie filled with emotionally charged talks and groovy 60s showmanship culminates in a battle scene fit to make the Huns roll over in their graves. All in all, the movie felt like the western movies that Rick Dalton himself acts in. When Cliff Booth, Ricks stunt double, gives a ride to a Hippie girl, and stirs up trouble at her commune by questioning their right to be on the estate, and smashing in the face of one resident who slashed his tire, Cliff becomes like the anti-hero in the classic cowboy movies he and Rick had starred in over the years: he rode into town on a white horse (Cadillac), calling a meeting wit the sheriff (the owner of the land), and dueling a helpless local who questioned his authority (tire slasher).", "Almost there, just not quite.": "Cinematography and music on point.However, it didn't quite hit the mark for a Tarantino film.", "Do watch Tarantino suggested viewing prior to watching": "Not what I would consider Tarantino's best movie effort but overall good viewing. There are a lot of hidden references, the standard focus on feet that we have grown to accept as 'normal' for his films along with that quiet, thought provoking wit and humour. Some people have suggested a focus on violence directed against woman which I personally never picked up on. If anything Lynette's abuse of George stood out along with the clear edit faults I am sure I saw ( Sharon Tate putting a scarf on then seeing her hair tangled and messy as she was driven in the car with the top down only to later be shown her taking off the scarf for her hair to blow in the wind but be less messy and more groomed - and then the appearing cowboy hat which appeared mid conversation on James head during a conversation on set with Rick). Clearly a movie that needs watched multiple times for full enjoyment with each viewing revealing another layer of detail.

Lio performance is outstanding as usual and so is Brad and Margot. Not the best of Tarantino but remains a masterpiece", "Extremely unique & entertaining": "**Best movie of the summer**Title: Once upon a time in Hollywood (2019)Quentin Tarantino really stepped out of his comfort zone to deliver a film with less glam than usual. This movie pays homage to 1960's Hollywood known as the Golden era. It's essentially a story of a washed up actor, staring down the barrel at middle age, trying to keep up with the changing times in Hollywood and in pop culture.\nDicaprio and Pitt are proving to be ageless wonders, as they both did outstanding jobs at playing less familiar roles. The movie has a unique spin on the Sharon Tate saga that ultimately proved to be a defining moment in the decade. The ending of the movie is surprisingly bloody but delivers an unforgettable sequence; this time ending in the way everyone wishes it would have the first go around.\nThe only downside to this movie is that between the story of the aging Rick Dalton and the cut scenes to the Sharon Tate build up, this movie is essentially a movie without a plot. However, the way Tarantino was able to intertwine historical moments (some haunted by the ghosts of real life events) with movie lore, makes for ultra-entertaining flick that is different from most movies you see in today's age.\nAlthough the movie was met with mixed critic reviews and was certainly an experiment for Tarantino... I think it was the best movie of the summer and is worth the watch for most crowds.", "Pleasantly surprised": "I am not a Tarantino fan. Resevoir Dogs was pretty good. Jackie Brown is by far the best thing he ever made, and the only one of his films I was really crazy about.\nSo I came into Once Upon a Time with low expectations. It is an excellent film! The acting , cinematography and yes, even the directing were all spot on.I can see why his lib-tard millenial \"fans\" who worship most of the total crap he's churned out might not appreciate this film (hell, they probably don't even understand it), but if you're not a drooling Tarantino fan boy, give it a chance. I think you'll be impressed.", "Shame about the story": "The imagery is great. The acting superb. The story, not so much. The real life elements were not a problem, QT captured the atmosphere of late 60's Hollywood so well you could have watched and listened to it all night. The problem was that these little bits of dialogue kept getting in the way. A lot of scenes could have been cut and not changed the film. It may sound picky, but when most cinemas are sticking 30 minutes of adverts before the film starts, I want a story that moves before I do. Saying that, its Tarantino, and he's still more interesting than most of disneyfied rubbish that's being released.", "Only looks good from a distance": "It's like when watching a beautiful woman.. until she starts rambling incoherent words.

It should be fairly obvious that the Manson Murders a year later would greatly influence him as a child. That little bit of insight gives greater meaning to the subject matter and title he chose for this film; \"Once upon a Time . . .in Hollywood\". It's a FAIRY TALE. . . that much is obvious. I believe that Tarantino (the man's) film fantasy exists simply because kid Quentin's thoughts were troubled so long ago when these murders collided with the film world he loved so much. And still does. Only a guess. Since then all of us Daydream or have sought that one (non existent) comforting thought that could ease the pain and frustration the \"Family\" caused so many. Restoring what was stolen from Ciello Drive, (and then the world) that night isn't a possibility. In THIS reality, anyway. Fortunately, QT straddles two worlds, this technical latticework and the other one of fantasy. The latter enables this film (so like a jack in the box overstuffed with murders), to both horrify all while still passing easily for the labor of love it obviously is-For Hollywood as well as the victims.\nPeople will still gripe because it's not \"Transformers 16\" And it's obviously not for the kiddies (nor for the biddies). This film will be loved most by those who've known loss by name, or those still angry and perplexed by the cruelty shown that summer. The director can make the theater loud with violence, but I still insist this is a fairytale despite your eyes widening instead of closing.\nThe REAL world is filled with bare and dirty feet. THIS one is brimming with glass slippers.\nOnly Quentin, could make a Prince Charming confident with a flame thrower. . . and not much else. And the Knight in the Shining Trailer? Who may or may not have his wife's blood on his hands? That makes him THE PERFECT wall for a pack of wolves to run into headfirst at night. On the trails that cut through the helter-skelter, the wild Beasts are saddling the tame beasts and then teaching others how to ride them. Beauty doesn't sleep unless she wants to, and anyone who asks for her heart in a box will get mauled by a dragon named Brandey instead (\"Good food for mean dogs\"). Nothing \"witchy\" will be allowed and the Devils business will be left undone. In THIS world where Rumplestilkson's charred trolls are found bobbing in a swimming pool, missions failed. Depriving their Leader of his bloody wants and leaving him to tantrum in the hayloft of a forgotten stable. Thats a GREAT world compared to what we inherited once the trial was over and the hoofbeats faded so many Oscars ago.\nThe once tangible is now dust (that goes for Charlie AND our klutz) and for so many decades citizens have played \"what if\" and \"If I was there It wouldn't have happened\" . . .but truthfully we can't change ANYTHING, and short of a DeLorean, this thoughtful bit of movie magic is our best bet for rewriting history. I choose Quentins version.", "CONTEXT CONTEXT CONTEXT": "When I came out of the cinema after this film I thought it was alright but I found the film quite empty. It wasn't until I got home and I found out the film is based on the Charlie Manson murders which is crucial information that must be known before watching the film. This is probably an explanation for the number of poor reviews already on IMDB as it completely changes the film and makes many scenes more worthwhile. The film then follows the typically disordered formulae of Tarentino films. So, please research the Manson murders and who Sharon Tate is before watching the film or even if you've already seen the film and were confused.", "So incredibly disappointing.": "Like most of the feee world, I love QT, but it pains me to say he has almost completely lost the plot. Firstly this is not a movie. It is pieces and scenes muddled together with an almost scrambled last 10 minutes attempting to validate the previous 2 hours 30 (err Quentin you forgot the plot part?). Acting, music, style yes, you can get that in a documentary. QT has forsaken the art of story telling and replaced it with art behind the art of story telling, in this film he has left out the story bit. This is his 9th, I don't know where to from here. He mastered story telling and building character through cool and cutting dialogue/scenes, clever interplays and cruel, shocking twists. I waited 150 minutes any of this in this movie and it never came. I thought Hateful 8 was a blown out, self indulgent one off, but OUATIH continues the slide.

Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth (DeCaprio and Pitt) lead us through a velvety Hollywood that feels more like Disney World than the dingy reality of today's City of Angels. Weaving their way through slick producers, starry eyed hippies and industry hacks, Dalton and Booth ultimately right a wrong, even if fictionally, that must have felt very personal to a young Tarantino. The pace is very measured, though it lacks the overlong monologues that serve as both plague and genius in other Tarantino flicks. This will lead some to call it plodding or slow, but I loved every second of screen time and the director known for demanding the audience's attention feels very much in control in this one.", "I honestly feel sorry for some people...": "I watched this movie about ten times and every time I wish it last forever.

Oh and *spoilers* they bring an unrelated character for 163 mins so that she opens that damn gate in the last 2 mins of the movie. Wth?Looks like people haven't seen anything better or just because of the cast and director they want to justify that its great. Trust me I was looking forward to this but this was beyond disappointing.Oh and did I mention it was boring?", "Waist of time and money": "This movie was really under what you can't expect from Tarantino.\nThere is nothing happening for almost the whole movie.", "Tarantino is the best filmmaker in history": "I had to watch this movie twice, and watch a bunch of reviews, and watch that amazingly satisfying ending multiple times in order to settle on the feeling I have about it now.I think Tarantino is the best filmmaker in history now. I love all his movies, and this one really is brilliant, especially the awesome and hilarious ending. 10/10", "A Love Letter": "This is very similar to a lot of Tarantino's other work. The plot is slow moving, dialogue heavy, with a big crescendo of a finale. It is also somewhat of a rewrite of commonly known history. None of these similarities serve as a fault, however. This picture is definitively within Tarantino's style, and it was a good source of entertainment despite containing perhaps a little too much filler.\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" was still able to be an original endeavor, mixing real life and fictional figures into one big, bright melting pot, and it served as a fitting homage to the golden age of the film/television industry.", "Leo and Brad save this from being a stain on Tarantino's amazing body of work": "I cannot believe that there are comments mentioning this in the same breath as pulp fiction. While this is a very well acted movie with good scenes and dialogue, the story is severely lacking direction and seems to meander about for large parts of the movie. Had very high expectations for this one and have definitely been let down!", "Helter Skelter": "The most enjoyable part of this film was Brad Pitt, secondly Leonardo DiCaprio. The backdrop of Hollywood in 1969 was the motivator that prompted me to see this movie. Against my better judgement, paying to see a Tarantino film was not on my short list. Due to the history of over the top violence in his previous films. This film in the end was just another over the top blood bath. All the beauty and touching scenes in the film culminated with his sick fueled violent insanity. I've been cured.", "Awesome! (Spoilers)": "Just finished watching this movie about an hour ago... I'm not a huge Quentin Tarantino fan but I did like Inglourious Basterds but I think I like this one even more... Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were really excellent Margot Robbie made a beautiful Sharon Tate... The only problem I thought was with the movie they could have cut 20 minutes out of the middle of it but the last half an hour is fabulous!! If you don't want to know how the movie ends quit reading now... Most of the scenes with Sharon Tate was very poignant as I know what ended up happening to her but this movie makes things right... The scenes where Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate goes in to watch the Matt Helm movie she was in with Dean Martin and the real Sharon Tate was on the screen with extremely sad... the scene where Brad Pitt visits the Spahn Ranch with the Manson family was very chilling... Let's just say at the end of the movie I was cheering for the Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio characters ...Plus a great scene with a pitbull LOL... Probably the least glad I've ever seen in a Tarantino movie... He captured 1969 very well and a great soundtrack to the movie as well... Go see this film!!", "So disappointed": "Once upon a tome in Hollywood is one of the longest, slowest movies I've ever seen. It didn't feel like a Tarantino movie until the last fifteen minutes. I was nodding off it was so slow. Half the movie was people driving with no dialogue. It had all the pieces but just fell flat. Pitt and DiCaprio did great with what they had but it feels like The Emperors New Clothes. No one wants to say it sucks because of who made it and who's in it. There were a few great scenes that then came to a screeching halt to more nothing.\nThe couple next to us actually got up and left halfway through.", "Boring and no story": "What is the point of the movie? This is just dialogue after dialogue and nothing ever happens. There is no real story, no development happening or anything like this at all. I really don't need action filled fast paced movies but this ist just dull and boring. This happens when the director has the privilege to edit the movie as he wishes and the studio has to take it as is.Avoid at all costs.", "No plot, no problem... ?": "Tarantino's 9th film takes the viewer to the late 60s Hollywood and probably is the closest depiction of real life events he's ever made. The main key surrounds the horrible murder that took place that same year at a household in Hollywood, resulting deaths of several people including famous actress Sharon Tate. Tarantino did not really place the events one to one as it happened, but rather turned the events upside down which gave the movie an interesting final note.But oh boy was that an odd way to reach this point! And that is not meant as a compliment.The main characters are sort of a burned out actor played by DiCaprio and his stunt double played by Brad Pitt. For the first half of the movie (Or around \u00be) these two are shown taking on a role in a spaghetti Western which they are a bit hesitant about at first. Tarantino had a great chance to throw in lots of references to the moviemaking of the period and basically he made a film about making films during the era. What was the meaning of such a plot and how would it affect the final events you may ask? Well, it does not! Not in the smallest way. Tarantino basically satisfied his ambition to create some scenes which resembled the filmmaking of the period and that was that.Later on the duo got a chance to travel to Italy to make about another four westerns and when they returned an awful lot of narration was required to set things back on the road, sort of. Basically the time for endgame action was there, but this time the murderers visited the wrong house and got what they deserved. The duo ended their lives in typically gruesome fashion and knowing what happened in real life, it was really satisfying to see them coming to their ends in that way. The end.What this movie lacks big time is the tension and connection between the scenes, characters and different parts of the film. It's not really a mess that often some Tarantino's movies can be. The first part is incredibly needless and does not serve any purpose at all. The same can be said about Margot Robbie role. I'm not accusing the film of slow pacing, because I found it really effective in Jackie Brown, which probably had the slowest tempo of any QT's movie. The history rewriting was done very well in this one, especially compared to ridiculous fictional WW II events in Inglorious Basterds. It's just that majority of the film seemed pointless and really disjointed. The visit to mysterious ranch by Cliff the stuntman ended up being really underwhelming and the final attack seemed too random which wasn't really tied to Cliff's visit. I also feel that Tate's character reveal in the end would have had more surprising effect on audience.\nThe ending action is very quintessentially Tarantino style and is very enjoyable. The final tribute to all the victims, guided by an alternative version to real life, is superb and so is the acting. I understand what Tarantino wanted to showcase, but I can't justify the needless parts of the film in any way. It could have been only the final 30 min action and the viewers would not have missed anything. Instead we got hours of this sort of a random flirt with the 60's cinema with no substance. No real ongoing theme in this film, but it really should have had a stronger backbone. It can't get away with that like Pulp Fiction did with ease. I see so many people justifying the non existing plot and cohesiveness, but I just can't help, but to say that this is the weakest film by Tarantino to date.", "A disjointed collection of beautiful scenes": "Some really great scenes and amazing acting.

He fails to captivate.\nThe characters are unconvincing and don't pull in the audience.", "SO DISAPPOINTING": "Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director of the modern age in film making. I was so ready for this movie but sadly, I was so disappointed. Most of Leos scenes were far too long and far too boring.... Although his scene in the trailer was very funny. The best scenes were with Brad Pitt whose character was great. I also found the actual movie clips of Sharon Tate a wonderful nod. The set design was spot on. I felt like I was truly peeking in on the 60s, especially the cars. That aspect of the movie was very fun. The music was fitting and worked well too. I think my biggest sadness comes from the lack of witty banter that one expects from Tarantino films and again, the boring western shots that were far too long. I loved the ending which for me is the fairy tale ending and the huge FU finger to The Family.", "Patchy movie": "At times it's a great movie with a star studded cast but times it's quite average (I loath the scenes that use narration - very lazy storytelling).The set design,costumes and acting are top notch but this un-Tarantino style film isn't one of his best", "A hot mess": "Acting is good but the movie Is all over the place. Just a complete waste of time and typical Quentin junk. If you want to waste 2.5 hours of your time, enjoy this hot mess... Has Quentin ever made a good movie?? Nope... They all suck. Warm moist turd pretty much sums this thing up. Flush...", "I'm not gonna make it": "I'm half way, it's so bad , nothing is HAPPENING !? Feet, skinny blondes, hair blowing drives.

All the characters are very interesting. The movie is 2 hours and 48 minutes long but you Don't feel it. Very cool also all the \"easter eggs\" and references.

Absolutely one of the best Tarantino movies.", "Amazing ending!": "The whole movie is so beautiful shot! Every camera scene is a joy for the eye.

The cast and director/writer are the only reason tickets sold for this movie, and critic's fearful of going against the grain are what gave this movie such great reviews. This is what happens when a cult classic writer becomes mainstream and puts a twist on conventional \"storytelling\"; a story is never told.I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you're feeling extremely nostalgic and also have an unreasonable and obscure knowledge of life in the 1960s.", "Ruined my weekend": "Dont understood all the rave reviews. Did we watch the same movie? Personally I dont care about 60's Hollywood nostalgia. It was self indulgent drivel.

Sorry Sharon, you don't deserve this.", "First Tarantino movie that doesn't get 10/10": "I know and love QT's work - it's only the high expectations why I'm a little bit disappointed. Brilliant camera work, unbelievable level of details really bring us back to 60's LA.\nHowever I missed the genius dialogues and tense scenes that chain my attention for most of the movie. It looks like lots of wasted time and left the real action for the end. The ending was so great that it made me give 9/10, without that it would've scored a 6 only. Too slow for too long.\nPitt and DiCaprio are brilliant, that's no suprise. I also loved that Michael Madsen showed up for a tiny scene.", "Festival of boredom": "Well, I was really excited about this movie because I really like some of QT movies but this was so bad. You just wait for something, then after an hour you still wait and after 2hours still wait... Basically only good thing about this movie are great actors. Almost 3 hours of nothing. Waste of time and money, wish I could go back in time and not watch this abomination of a movie and disrespect for the viewers.", "Words Tarantino movie... so far": "I tried to have no expectations at all when watching this, afraid I would be disappointed.\nSadly, my instinct was wrong, I was more disappointed than I though.\nWith again a familiar cast from past Tarantino movies, in the first 20 minutes I was waiting for something to happen, then after 40 minutes in I was already seeing where this was all going, nowhere.\nI usually give half an hour tops to wait if a movie grabs me or not, this one achieved to not grab me until the end.\nThe only reason I kept watching, was because of Caprio or PItt, waiting for it to get better.\nUnbalanced in ryhthm, lot's of back view driving (ala \"Bullitt\"), with a soundtrack almost limited to what's playing on a car radio.\nLot's of clich\u00e9s, exaggerated hippie motifs everywhere, the movie lacks pace, sense or reason for me to bother with the characters, with some even thrown in just to provide a bland reason to watch the finale.\nThe Bruce Lee wannabe appearance had no point at all, the Tate case was highly avoidable (common, did Tarantino really need to mess with it?).\nBut let's say he really had to include those 2 elements, at least include them with proper character development, in an organized script that actually is interesting, not this sketch of a movie, with clich\u00e9 stereotypes being thrown at you like some annoying pop-ups.\nThe worst Tarantino movie ever and I might say that he got lost after \"Django\", failing to deliver over and over again until now hitting rock bottom.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" will always be his masterpiece, this one his lowest... so far.", "How does he get away with it?": "Another Tarantino monster of a film. It grabs you by the neck at once and drags you through two and a half hours of late 60's Hollywood bravaura based on the life of a TV stuntman and his body double. Its full of dark humour as you'd expect, and it's a winner in all the artistic departments, including acting. But I don't like a director who's so cocky and manipulative that he eventually can't resist the temptation to distort history by turning the Tate murders into a tale of revenge where the guilty foursome end up as the victims. How does he get away with it?", "Good acting but that's all": "The acting is great, as mentioned in my review title, and I fully understand and respect the homage to that Hollywood era, but apart from that there is no coherent action in the movie, just a chain of real life events with basically no connection in between, over a way too long movie duration, and much less humor than we are used to with Quentins movies.", "There must be something else to watch...": "A bloated, meandering tale. This movie is a big waste of talent and money. Oh and my time...", "horribly boring": "Wasted 3 hours total torture to audience. it should haVE better then this. director of this ,movie should be arrested to make such movie.", "An absolute masterpiece.": "I'm not always a Tarantino film, in fact I often like most those films of his that others don't. But, I thought Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood was simply amazing and thoroughly deserved all the awards it won - with special praise for Brad Pitt giving his best performance since Twelve Monkeys.If you are under 40, you probably won't get it. But, if you are over 40 you will appreciate where he is coming from.", "I'm unable to describe this movie ...": "... because barely ever has watching a movie felt this pointless to me. This movie did not make me experience any type of emotion.After 2.5 hours of slow paced scenes that don't build up towards anything, 2.5 minutes of 'QT sensation' did not catch my interest any longer.It surely could not have been the script or plot quality that managed to assemble this well performing cast.", "It's just for a minority": "Seems this movie was made for just a small group of spectators. As a Tarantino movie we start to speculate that we are about to watch a violent scene, a remarkable dialogue but unfortunately we have it only in the last 10 minutes. I finished this movie trying to not believe that I reached the end.", "Certainly watchable, but like all of recent Tarantino, characters are shallowly done. no actual overall story": "The people giving this film very low rating or a none or ten are not serious.\nThe film is certainly entertaining enough with outstanding period portrayal, two yeoman actors that may not be truly great actors but who certainly know their craft. The dialogue is great, and the final sequence action is as well. No on is going to walk out of this film not having been entertained. almost all the craft of good filmaking is present.\nThat said the overall experience is hollow. Not everything has to have serious meaning, but \"Once upon a Time\" has none,m and really doesn't constitute a story.", "Would not watch this more than once if that.

The edge from his previous films isnt there, it was a bit boring without the expected suspense.Dont get me wrong, its still a good movie, to claim anything different would be stupid, but its Just so much worse than the rest.\nIt feels like its a movie made by a Hollywood elite For other Hollywood elites, and that is Sad. I feel he lost the connection with ordinary moviewatchers with this one..", "So many liers doing reviews": "I was at the cinema the other night to watch this\nNot one person left the building .The film is probably not for everyone Just too many people doing reviews and telling lies .Do not believe any of these people that say ,they left early .That is pathetic", "A flawed but masterfully made piece of cinema": "The story follows several different characters in Hollywood during the year 1969, in particular television turning film actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo Dicaprio) and his stunt man Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). It captures their struggle to success in the business and also offers a look at real-life figure, actor Sharon Tate. This film really subverted my expectations and I was really excited by the fact it did this after it finished. Throughout a lot of the running time, I wondered if some longer sequences were really warranted and there's no doubt that it is overlong. However, when you have the ending in mind, it'll certainly be worth watching again and I think it'll offer a whole fresh perspective on things. The performances are wonderful and the writing is superb as always from QT; although stylistically you'd be forgiven for watching this and not even having Tarantino come to mind. It's not his most distinctive film and in a way that's what makes it interesting also; he's doing something different to the style he's perfected and that's to be celebrated in itself for bravery. Performance wise it's pitch perfect with Dicaprio and Pitt being brilliant headliners and Margot Robbie portraying Tate with such sensitivity and respect, you have to love it. A beautiful tribute to a bygone era and a woman who suffered a terrible tragedy, this is definately one to see on the big screen and it stayed with me for a while after watching due to its sun-drenched yet melancholic tone. The final 20 minutes are fantastically done!", "Excellent pieces never really come together and end up with self-indulgent mediocrity": "Almost any given scene in this film is excellently crafted. The acting is fantastic, the dialog is fun, the cinematography, editing, and music all work well together. But once those scenes are assembled, you end with a film that just doesn't come together. There's really nothing that justifies the nearly 3-hour run-time and entire characters, including Margot Robbie's excellent Sharon Tate could have been completely cut out. Even DiCaprio's Rick Dalton could have been cut down to a few minutes of screen time and told the same story. Ultimately, there's probably about 30-minutes of actual story here. I got the feeling that Tarantino wanted to do something like a Short Cuts/Magnolia-style mosaic of semi-interrelated characters but felt the need to do an Inglorious-style alternate-history rage fantasy also and the two never got resolved. In the end, the movie does neither extremely well. The major characters mostly feel developed and realistic (except for the villains) but they really don't have any arc or grow or change in any way. Tons of plot threads never pay off and the changes to actual history feel forced and unrealistic. Even the violent climax was disappointing with a dog (an awesome dog) really doing most of the work. Large portions of the supporting roles seem to be more a collection of cameos than a real cast, which means that it's both distracting and you don't get enough time with many characters for them to develop.That said, Tartantino really understands character and how to show us who Cliff, Rick, and Sharon really are and what matters to them. He also does a great job building suspense in a few key scenes. It's a shame that he couldn't get all of the different parts to come together like he did with Inglorious or Pulp Fiction.", "Tarantino justice on Charies Manson's family": "If you're not familiar with the story of Sharon Tate I highly recommend reading about her before watching the movie..

Read Helter Skelter in the mid 70s and learned everything. These events haunted my teenage years and were always in the background, I didnt realise how much until I saw this movie. The ending was satisfying beyond belief, I walked out of the theatre and actually felt good, all the while knowing of course it wasnt real, but it was soooooooo good to see it. Loved the saturated colours and the clothes, cars and general feeling were 100 percent right, even for a strictly media repressed Oz teenager who only dreamt of clothes like Margot wore in the movie.. Tarantino's meandering dialogue worked, especially with Dalton in his trailer beating himself up, huge laugh. Bonding between Brad and Leo marvellous to see, all the actors gave everything they had, the movie just worked in every way possible. Bears no semblance to reality but great fun, giving us a chance to relive history in a good way, even the violent scenes.

Anyone who loves film will be sorry to see it end and busy anticipating seeing it again (and maybe again). LA of 1969 as well as TV and the movies from that time couldn't have been better presented but more than that there is enough relevancy to today to prevent a mere trip down memory lane. \"Food for thought\" would be the understatement of the year.

For about 2 hours and 30 minutes (out 2hrs and 41min) NOTHING HAPPENS! You get to see Leo and Brads characters drive around with nothing happening. They go places where things don't happen. There's other characters that pop up and don't do anything interesting. Heck, there's a scene where Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski go to the Playboy mansion and I was SURE something interesting was gonna happen. Nope. Nothing. There's another scene where Brads character squares off with Bruce Lee in what I though was gonna be an epic fight. They each knock each other down once and some lady breaks up the fight. That's it. Then they go back to doing nothing interesting again. There is one scene where Brad Pitt ends up at the Manson Family ranch and there's a really good chance he might be in terrible danger. Wrong again. He gets to punch a hippie a couple of times and makes him change the flat tire he slashed but nothing else interesting happens. Finally at the end of the movie there's some excitement and violence if you've managed to stay awake that far but then nothing else really happens for 5-10 min. Before the credits roll and you sit there wondering what the hell that was all about. Anyway, if you wanna try slogging through Qs latest I wish you all the luck in the world.

In both of these movies, Tarantino has changed history to the benefit of his audience. They are dreams of how we wish the world worked--Like they do in the movies.Tarantino's biggest success in this film was in creating a movie dedicated to a single individual where that individual is not a main character of the film. She is presented significantly in it, but both Cliff and Rick are the main characters. This could have been a biopic of Sharon Tate, but just like super hero origin stories, it would have been a miss.Tarantino is a film maker. He has watched more movies than should be humanly possible. The moment of Tate's death created an impact not just on the freewheeling culture in Hollywood, but also the films that followed in the wake of her death. This movie is Tarantino's third movie in changing history--What if Sharon Tate had not been horribly murdered by Manson's followers?There was a time in Hollywood where rugged action heroes saved the day. Fictional characters that existed in the country's subconscious. In reality though, even those heroes could not save Sharon Tate. In Tarantino's fantasy, they were able--No matter how ignorant and belligerent. In the context of films of that era, it's a fantasy to believe.Sharon Tate was murdered because the world is cruel. Wouldn't it be nice to still pretend it wasn't so, just like in the way Hollywood used to portray it?", "So booooooring!!!!": "Great actors and kind of Hollywood documentary (parody?) but boy is this film BOOOOOOORRRIIIIINNNNNGGGG!!!! :)", "Boring Rubbish!": "The most pointless, boring, film of the decade which Hollywood churns out a lot of to cater to the egos of their highly-paid actors.

This was a beautiful film for sure visually, good solid acting, but the narrative was just way too weak for my taste.", "'It's official, old buddy. I'm a has been'": "Viewing ONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD is a visit to the 1960s - California/Hollywood style. Quentin Tarantino both wrote and directed this very long and lugubrious film that features some very fine acting but requires more than a dollop of patience to make it to the clever final scene.The 'idea' is to recreate Hollywood and the months leading up to the entrance of Charles Manson's tribe, as the infamous night in 1969 becomes a theatrical twist of facts. Leonardo DiCaprio is convincing as a has-been action star Rick Dalton and Brad Pitt is excellent as his stunt double Cliff Booth. Tarantino convincingly intertwines tidbits of the life of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha) and their third party Jay Sebring (Emil Hirsch), leading us to think the film will end with the Tate et al murders, but the road to that end is twisted and cleverly altered - like Hollywood. Other key actors include the very fine young Julia Butters, Al Pacino, Bruce Dern, Luke Perry, Timothy Olyphant, Margaret Qualley et al.The movie is very long, spending an excessive amount of focus on cigarette smoking and the use of the 'f word' and endless cinematic production takes, but the overall effect of the film - in retrospect - is how clever Tarantino used these 'flaws' to bring the 60's Hollywood to life. This may not be a film for everyone, but the piece works - it just needs patience.", "So much style...so little substance": "Just before I start, Resevoir Dogs is my favourite film by QT, but Pulp Fiction is clearly his best. This film lacked what made those movies great: substance. Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is probably the best film ever when it comes to style, but I personally needed more plot. Yes, studying an aged, outdated actor was interesting, but it wasnt enough. The tragedy is that this film had all the ingredients needed for an utterly fantastic movie, but it seemed as if there was almost no attempt at mixing them together. It is almost as if Tarantino didn't even attempt to make it coherent, and instead he thought that we'd all like it because he nailed the style and art.It is also a shame because this film could have been an instant classic. The scene at the ranch, and the last 20 mins were absolutely fantastic, and the tension building was spot on, but that was all there was for me that actually showed how good this film could have been. The acting was good too, and the characters, although I didn't like any character likeable bar Margot Robbie's, were perfectly played.Just a side note, I felt mixed feelings about the violence at the end. I am nonplussed when it comes to violence usually; it neither makes the film better, nor does it make the film any worse, but the violence here seemed out of touch with the rest of the film. Just because Tarantino's signature is violence, that doesn't mean he needed it so excessively here. And the Staffordshire Bull Terrier just breaking out into rage mode, although it was awesome to see the dog save everyone, was completely unnecessary, and doesn't help the stigma towards the breed. A staffy isn't violent unless it has been trained to be, they actually tend to love everyone, and they wouldn't know to bite someone's balls off unless they had been trained to do so.I wouldn't say this film disappointed me, and it would be unfair if I said that because of anyone else had made this film, someone I hadn't heard of, maybe, then I wouldn't have been disappointed. There was absolutely nothing wrong with it, but because Tarantino has delivered so well in the past, it built the expectations for this movie. It was a perfectly okay film, but had the potential to be a lot more than it was.If I am being exact, I'd give this film a 6.4/10.", "Can see why people didn't get it": "I can understand people want all the blood and violence of tarantinos past films.......... But this was fantastic I loved it. People moaned nothing happens till the end seriously underrated film. If you didn't like it give it 5 years go back to it you'll love it", "Tarantino tried something here, but it didn't work": "I'm not really quite sure what he tried. There are hints at just trying to make a more conventional (less \"Tarantino\") movie, or a sort of a fairy-tale. It is named \"Once Upon a Time (in Hollywood)\", but it's not like Once Upon a Time in the West or in New York, which are regular historic pieces. Also, trying to show the life of most people in the industry, who struggle and don't really know what to expect and do about it - and contrasting that to the idyllic life of Sharon Tate - well, actually Margot Robbie really.The thing is, while I can't figure out what exactly Tarantino tried here, I can say it didn't work. The first ~90 minutes of the movie feel too slow and pointless. There a few jokes, but, way, way too little. Since his style (not just in this movie) is not of a realistic one, then the whole showing of the series shooting process in the 60's doesn't make much sense.Perhaps the biggest problem is the acting. Pitt and DiCaprio do solid work, but are kind of in the same \"I'm not really sure what we're doing here\" situation. Margot Robbie is actually bad. Not terrible, but bad. She's a pretty woman, but, she's not aging well and thus is not a good fit for Sharon Tate who was the epitome for a \"pretty young blonde\" for her time. I get it, Margot Robbie was for the time ~5 years ago and Tarantino couldn't find a replacement, but, still, that's not the only problem. She tries to somewhat imitate Sharon Tate, mostly with the characteristic gaze a lot of actresses did at the time. But, it doesn't really work. It's Margot Robbie doing some stuff, we don't see Sharon Tate.What does work?The \"mechanics\" do. There's very good camera work (though nothing as impressive as the theatre scene in Inglorious Basterds), lightning is also good, tone ditto... You really see that by now Tarantino has become a good, if unconventional, director.The Bruce Lee \"flashback\". It's great. Don't listen to people who try to pull some SJW stuff here for whatever reason. It does a great comedic portray of the silly of Bruce Lee.The finale. It is a Tarantino finale, so, there's lots of very graphic and somewhat meaningless violence. But, it's fast, interesting and funny. There's more fun and funny in the finale (~15 min) then in the whole movie before (>2h).So, it is worth a watch and it does make you think more than other Tarantino movies, but, it's certainly not close to his best work.", "One star is Leo DiCaprio, the rest...": "Jesus Christ, this was so f** boring... thank god QT said that he will stop making movies on his 10th", "Slow": "It's a very slow-paced movie. Ones not acclimatized to Hollywood if the 70s may not be able to relate to it. It has a few funny moments. The acting is splendid. Too much footage has been given to people's feet. Expect the unexpected in this movie.", "QT showing his knowledge of golden age Hollywood": "At first watch i had mixed feelings, was a bit disappointed. Now i edit my review. Movie is just showing QTs knowledge to films and that Hollywood era. Nice to rest your eyes in beautiful cinematography. Looking forward to next QT movie and expect some crazy action \ud83d\ude01", "Twice the length required, half the film promised": "Quentin Tarantino is never going to get bad press as long as he draws breath; he's created his own self-sustaining bubble of rare releases, propped up by rave reviews from anyone who can scribble down a legible sentence on a page (hypocrite much?). OUATIH follows Rick Dalton and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt) as they try to stay afloat in a business leaving them behind, all whilst navigating the quirks of Hollywood. However, this idyllic story is not what many have claimed this film to be - sure, there are brief stylised glimpses of Hollywood's golden age, but they are too fleeting to really consider this film a tale of the era. Realistically, this is a mis-paced, mis-aligned story, and isn't half the film it could have been.Whilst everything is acted well and the set/costume design is incredible, ultimately Sharon Tate's character (played by Margot Robbie) could be cut from the film with zero loss. One moment you'll be watching DiCaprio and Pitt masterfully acting their respective roles (DiCaprio once again showing his effortless range), and the next you see Robbie sitting in a theatre for a 15-minute stint. It completely kills the first half of the film, and makes you wonder when the eventual plot device to marry the two groups is going to happen. Spoiler: it never comes, and by the end I was left wondering why half of the plot even happened. Its not that Margot Robbie's acting is bad (she is fairly strong as expected), or that her script isn't good - her character is just inconsequential, included solely to tie the plot to some semblance of reality. Only in the final half an hour does the plot begin to really move, and only then does Tarantino really produce some cinema magic.Dalton and Booth are undoubtedly the characters you go to see, but there are other exceptional performances: Timothy Olyphant, Mike Moh and Kurt Russell all lend good cameos, and breakout star Julia Butters (playing child actress Trudi) is incredible. This is also one of Tarantino's funnier scripts, with decent laughs from good writing and unexpected plot devices. However, this isn't enough to make up for a run time that is probably an hour too long, especially given the lack of content to actually pack out this blockbuster.", "So quick to come out on video says it all": "I give it a 3 for the brilliant actors and Bruce Dern however even they could not help this film.

Every one of his movies I thought have been gold. I wasn't a fan of Once upon a time in Hollywood however. It just seemed very boring and linear to me.

Which is a shame since my two favorite actors (Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio) and my favorite director (Tarantino) we're all involved in the movie. Critics seem to like it, which the more I read about it admittedly the more I appreciated what Quinten did, but on the same note, I feel like I shouldn't have to be told by critics how good the movie was.

Not knowing the history behind these events also confused me and I believe there were measures the filmmakers could have taken to avoid this from happening.

As the decade draws to a close, so to is the career of Rick Dalton (Leonardo Di Caprio), a faded star of westerns who's starting to realise his time is up. He now meanders aimlessly around, with his stunt double and best friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), but the pair are about to get a surprise, when Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), the wife of Roman Polanski, moves in next door to Rick, setting all of them on a dark and dangerous collision course with the Manson cult.And so, Quentin Tarantino rolls around with his ninth film. After a couple of attempts to resurge the western genre, in his signature gory way, here he returns to more familiar ground, keeping the western element in the background, with the lead character being a faded western actor. Returning, as always, with familiar faces he's worked with before, the familiar rapport and effective working partnership (along with new addition Robbie) work well in this slightly over indulgent but ultimately worthwhile romp.A director who is distinctively more driven by dialogue than plot, at times the story here feels as aimless as it's lead character's predicament, meandering along without much direction, and not really solid enough to sustain a nearly three hour length. It is driven along by a creepy sense of atmosphere, given the grisly build up to the real life events it's alluding to, along with, of course, the standard smooth dialogue and cool, funky soundtrack, but pays off with some darkly humourous shenaningans , involving some of the trademark Tarantino violence, which may explain the 18 certificate here.It doesn't have the strongest foundation to build on, and does require your patience a bit, but it does work in the end, albeit maybe not as well as it could have, guided along by a cool, attractive cast who fit the shoes of who they're playing fine, and bravely take creative licence with such sensitive true life events. ***", "Total waste of 3 hours": "I am big Tarantino fan.

Because it's essentially the same story as Inglourious Basterds, but moved from WWII Europe to late 1960's LA.But while everyone knows the horrific crimes against humanity Hitler and Nazi Germany committed during the Holocaust, I doubt a lot of audience members under the age of 45 will be educated in history enough (never mind old enough to remember) what the Manson Murders were.The problem with OUTH is, historically, until Charles Manson sent his followers to murder Sharon Tate and her friends, set on the last night in the film, Manson wasn't known for being a creepy, maniacal psychopath...except to The Beach Boys.At least in Django Unchained, beyond already knowing America was plagued by slavery until the Fourteenth Amendment, the audience sees the atrocities committed by the film's antagonist DURING THE COURSE OF THE FILM.So African American Freeman-Fox's bloody assassination of white slave holder DiCaprio-Candy is justified and cathartic in both an immediate story context within the film's narrative, as well as a larger historical context.By going to the same well of historical fiction once too often, Tarantino tells the story from the writer's viewpoint, instead of the audience's. So this time around, solely within itself, the film fails because Tarantino doesn't build a case to the audience within the narrative of how dangerous Manson and his cultists were. So we fail to appreciate how he turns history on its head to right a wrong and punish the guilty.\nKing made the same mistake in how he constructed 11/22/63.And without that historical knowledge shown by specific atrocities within the narratives of those prior films, the premise and impact of Tarantino's climax in OUTH is one dimensional and only gratuitous in its violence.Instead of meandering and overly languishing in the Pitt/DiCaprio/Robbie storylines (as well life in the mid-twentieth century entertainment industry), Quentin should have devoted more script time building up the creep factor of the Manson Clan. So when those four world's collided, they built to an emotionally justified climax. And not just a bloody conflagration.Tarantino missed a chance to offer us his take on Charles Manson. If he had showcased the madman more than in just a passing cameo, the role may have won the actor fortunate enough to play Manson an Oscar.Because Pitt deserved an Academy Award more for his role of good-old-boy-behind-enemy-lines-Nazi-hunter Lieutenant Aldo Raines in Inglorious Basterds, than he did for his portrayal of Cliff the dutiful manservant-stuntman in OUTH. It's not really Pitt's acting that's lacking. It's Tarantino's writing and character creation that is wanting.", "Love Letter": "People will say Once Upon a Time... is Quentin Tarantino's love letter to Hollywood, but it's really more of a love letter to himself.Tarantino's passions are all laid out here in full Technicolor: Hollywood glamour and its stars, nostalgia for 50s TV serials, ludicrous ultraviolence, and an unbridled enthusiasm for (dirty) foot fetishism. He is one of the most recognisable film nerds in the history of cinema, and this realisation of everything he loves about the industry up on the silver screen is his wet dream.And it's good. It's no secret that Tarantino is a very talented filmmaker; his talent for creating longform, engaging films is perhaps no more evident than it is here - the two and a half hour runtime flies by. This is attributable to his skills in blending thematic elements of comedy, tension, horror, and others on a whim throughout his screenplay. The imagery and mise-en-scene is also quite brilliant; not since Boogie Nights has 60's Hollywood looked this lush.Quentin didn't go to film school, he went to films, and here his passion for them is as tangible as ever.", "\"WHITE ONLY\" CAST!?

Margot Robbie was ok in her screen space. Al Pacino was great.The major drawback of the movie is a strong storyline and a solid plot. It seems that you are watching a movie and waiting for something to happen and suddenly it ends, however you will get some Tarantino feel in the climax of the movie.Screenplay is ok and is slow but will not bore you.

The movie charts and alternate course with what historically happened in that summer of 69, yet takes that ruse and runs it to cathartic heights.

None of it materialised. Any number of times, I was tempted to walk out on this self indulgent tale. One thing I can guarantee this film will not be a winner on the list of anyone's Christmas or birthday present list, or downloaded once it is released to the mainstream market. Sorry Quentin but this is probably your worst film ever. Put this next to Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs and you have to admit this doesn't even come close.

The name of the movie alone suggests us that we are going to watch a tale, not a fairy one for sure, but a tale that takes place in Hollywood in 1969. This tale is told by Quentin Tarantino, whose one of the best skills is to alter the history for the tastes of people who wish, some certain events would have ended differently. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a movie that follows some events and create action and reaction situations. It simply focuses on the lives of an actor and his stuntman and their ordinary but extremely funny and natural adventures that takes place in Hollywood. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is both an action and character-based movie. The comedy parts mostly come from the performances, gestures, thoughts, conversations and looks of the actor Rick Dalton performed by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his stuntman, Cliff Booth, performed by Brad Pitt. They both share the leading and supporting roles of the movie in my opinion, while they carry the movie further, average performances of Margot Robbie, as Sharon Tate, and Al Pacino, as Schwarz, adds an extra flavor to the movie. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a compact movie. There is a bit of everything. For more than two hours you just watch the ordinary lives of people in Hollywood and towards the end, the movie takes a direction towards a real event that happened in 1969 by \"Charles Manson Family\" which resulted in the murder of 5 people in the house of director Roman Polanski, including his wife Sharon Tate. Quentin Tarantino takes this event, changes it, adds his story and actors in it and serves the justice to the murderers by altering the real event which provides a sensational final to his movie. He did exactly the same alteration of course in his Inglorious Basterds. Those alterations are extremely bloody and satisfying. If you are familiar with the director, you will not be surprised watching violent, gore and bloody scenes in his productions. This is his signature and this is how he serves justice. This is what puts him in a different place than the other directors and this is what he is criticized the most. This is why, once again in my opinion, he is not going to win the Best Directing Award but this is also why he is considered one of the most talented directors of all times. He knows how to write a story, how to put it in practice and how to get the best out of actors playing it and harmonizing everything he has in an artistic way. His love for Western is visible also in this movie and the unity between Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are impeccable. When you watch the movie, you will realize that it is artistic and very well made from A to Z. You understand it is different, you agree that this is how a movie should be made. It has something to offer each and every audience. 10 Academy Award Nominations prove my point as well.", "An Amazing Film With A Mediocre Plot": "Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood has amazing acting, direction, cinematography, and a beautifully executed tribute to Sharon Tate. However, even though the film has incredibly fleshed out characters, it unfortunately relies too heavily on exposition to move the plot forward. Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth aren't utilized to the best of the film's abilities since the best of their inclusions lie within their interactions. Story-wise, they only provide conveniences and filler to take up space in Tarantino's most maturely paced movie yet. Still though, they are great characters and never cease to be entertaining, no matter if they're moving the plot forward or not. Sharon Tate's inclusion is what really solidified the greatness of the film. She is portrayed beautifully and respectfully to provide touching commentary on the horrific event that she faced in reality. This is also a reason as to why the ending is incredible and doesn't rip off Inglorious Basterds in any way, no matter what anyone says.

At 160+ mins it's a long trudge but the script probably only had few pages if compared with other movies of this length, why?... So many scenes are made up of shots of bods getting into cars, then long internal shot from back seat (lifted from the far better Gun Crazy' 50s) then bods get out of car, long shots of feet walking, more bods get into cars, more long internal driving shot, bods again get out of car, more feet walking. This format is repeated from beginning to end -pages of same-- The 60s heralded in a new low for movie making - features like; 'Beach Blanket Bingo', 'How to stuff a Wild Bikini ', 'Sergeant Deadhead' were playing as main features across the land, el-cheapo's had become the new norm. What would usually have been a 'B' picture were now being sold as an 'A'. Yes. It may have helped a jaded Hollywood at that time but what about other mainstream audiences?So, what might have influenced TQs fixation with this downturn in the social morays of movies? Tarantino grew up in the swinging '60s/mod '70s working in a porn cinema (this perhaps explains his addiction to perversity) including a video store - while also watching the endless re-runs of TV shows, along with an overflowing barrage of low budget, Spaghetti westerns that had flooded the market - thank goodness some audiences grew up (well, some did) and demanded better. These endless 'homage's to days offering little more than cheap TV-style quickies --now being released to the big screen --- with product that was generally catering for a guide-less, acid tripping youth (such as the Manson crew, etc) wanting endless simple-minded partying. Hollywood producers loved it - now, for half the normal budgets, they were getting the same financial returns as quality features.QT has simply revived those days and a new 'comic book hero' generation have picked it up.. Only this time round, the budgets are BIGGER while the contents remain juvenile, if not ridiculous. Trouble is, too many of today's producers and art critics also grew up in this overly comfortable, 'anything goes' era, so they wrap on about the glorious emptiness that's making then all rich. Some rave about the cinematography and design - with that much money being thrown about its simple to 'copy' the work of previous Masters. But, no matter how expensively dressed-up and stylishly packaged rubbish may be, it's still rubbish (but, GOOD-LOOKING rubbish). Too much you might be saying? Take a look back, revisit many of those poorly scripted, badly acted, TV shows and movies of the 50s-60s - the ones Q. T. tends to dote over...you may be surprised how your memory may have failed you as just how poor most were.Once U. A. T. I.

In short, it's a clever comedy that will touch those who love Hollywood's golden age film culture.", "Brad Pitt": "Only part about this movie worth seeing is Brad Pitt! Movie stinks other than Brad!", "Tarantino is losing his touch": "This movie is just a mess.It relies so much on heavy-handed narration to carry the plot which is a jumbled mess. It's like someone wrote a list of things and people they liked in the 70s, smooshed them into a movie and wove a mediocre plotline through those things.It avoids gravity or depth like the plague to just float from thing to thing and hope well-known actors bring enough enthusiasm from audiences.", "Only for Americans": "The actors are great, the looks are superb and the music is as it should be.. but after a thirth scene in a car with some 'time appropiate' music you start to wonder what the movies purpose really is.\nIt feels useless.. It is not a documentary but it should be. It's a bit of a drama movie I guess.. the action well.. the last 5 minutes of the movie feel like it had to be put in there somewhere.. But because the slowness of the movie it never fits..\nI felt like I waisted time when I left the cinema and I am sure nobody ment it to be like that. But I am not an American.. for Americans it should be sweet history I can only asume..", "If only...": "Once upon a time in Hollywood. There once was a night filled with utter terror. A night that lives in infamy. A night that drove fear into the hearts and minds of Americans. If only it didn't happen. What would have been, is anyones guess. I think QT is giving us the gift of that 'what if'.\nThings could've gone right along and followed the events of history, but they didn't. This new story is great for so many reasons. It reminds us of the love affair we had with T.V.\nTelevision was a journey to fantasyland. It entertained us all. There were trays invented so we could eat in front of the T.V., dinners invented to help us view our shows quicker. This reminds us where we started and now we watch things that are 100x worse without a flinch. Along comes A message from Sadie, that she wants to kill those that taught her to kill. A jab at our current voracious appetites. And now, now we want Quentin Tarantino's film to up the ante.\nIt starts pulling us in, it meanders and twists and changes our perspectives. It gives a new version without being obvious, although, I would say the first clue that we would be going the way Tarantino was guiding us was during the Bruce Lee scene. I was thinking, no way, no way. It didn't dawn on me til after the end that we weren't meant to be watching a documentary, or a dramatization of real events. We were watching a creation of an alternate evening. A gift of a new night, of what could have been. Thank you QT, I enjoyed it thoroughly.", "Unfunny, slow, no story": "Good ; Beautiful cinematography and good acting from DiCaprio. Good soundtrack.Bad : Not a comedy - I laughed aloud maybe once and only in incredulity.The violence was sickening and I honestly think it shouldn't be allowed to be shown - but this is a society wide problem. People must be sick in the head to be able to watch that and not cover their eyes and stop their ears. I don't understand why Tarantino is celebrated, nor why violence on screen is celebrated in this culture.Margot Robbie wasted in a role which wasn't a role. All she got to do was smile and look pretty.Pace was draggingly slow. Seems like it was a vanity project for the director.

As the movie played i felt a crane picking me up and dropping me into 1969. I was immersed. The denseness was overwhelming. The film sets, the tv shows ,the music, the ads all recalling a time long gone. We catch a glimpse of an obscure film poster or a part of a tv show or a song on the radio we might have forgotten that fits the theme perfectly. This was art and entertainment told in a way only a great movie can achieve.\nPitt and DiCaprio are on fire both Oscar worthy .\nOne of those movies that needs a second viewing just to take in all the subtle pop culture references that may have been missed the first time.\nCongratulations QT you did it again!", "Tarantino again writes his own world": "This is a movie which, if you'll understand, you'll know how tarantino plays with the real world happening and how the movie tampers with it giving you excitement. First of all you need to know the infamous tragedy of Sharon Tate in 1960s, which will eventually after a point in the movie play on your mind and you'll realise that Tarantino is again rewriting his fantasised history. Tge beauty of the film is that it transcends between real world tragedy and the fantasy fate of it. Tarantino throws in two fictional characters to save a real life character in the movie and if you don't understand this you'll not enjoy the movie. This is what it feels like watching a movie of 2019 where filmamking and storytelling is so advanced that only a few can understand and realize the beauty of it. Just one thing that could have been better if we could have been treated some action of the two main leads a little more somewhere in the middle of the movie, around after 80 minutes of the movie it feels just a little bit slow, that could have been a little more entertaining. But a great movie and a must watch if you watch Tarantino movies and know how he goes by them.", "Better watch clouds go by then this piece of...": "If Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie can't get better roles they should quit acting.

I kept watching, thinking everything would tie in together in the end but it didn't. Very little time was spent developing the characters from the Manson family.

And it seems, at times, that there are too many known actors. My brain is trying to get to see the very best performance from each of them (because I like most of them a lot!) but it just doesen't melt together like it has done in his earlier moviesIt is missing the...omph and sharpness that I was hoping for, and I guess it all comes down to tasteBut I am, unforunately, disappointedStar of the movie: The dog!!!", "Another boring comedy film!

As turnout, this film is about acting career of Rick and his stunt double(Cliff) at 1969 Hollywood! Entire film full of overuse of the driving and dancing scene! Bored to freaking death! Barely laughable scene is, Rick toasting \"May all my wife and sweetheart never met\"! The fighting of Bruce Lee with Cliff also spoil by the lady come in! Very disappointed! The female character keep hanging up their leg in the cinema, in the car and in the house felt so disgusting and rude! Barely intense scene is at the ending of the film! At the end, a bunch of people went into Cliff's house to kill him! Cliff order a dog to bite them, he and Francesca fight with them too!

Watching with high expectation but disappointed instead!", "'Once upon a time' indeed.": "It seems a lot of people missed the point of this final Tarantino instalment and either loved it because it's Tarantino or hated it because they thought it was long and pointless or graphically brutal.These people are the ones that don't know the original story of the terrifying Manson Family murders and how it truly tragically ended for Sharon Tate and her friends.Knowing all about Charlie Manson and his sinister, twisted cult, I was immediately excited when QT announced this movie, but imagine my surprise when he completely changed the ending from the truth...Clue was in the name, doh!Quentin Tarantino took a tragic story and glossed it over with a happy, Hollywood ending, and boy... I wish it really had gone down that way.I rewatched this movie again recently to catch a glimpse of all the brilliant actors I'd missed the first time round, including Austin Butler, who I'd completely forgotten had a role.This movie is, in true QT fashion, a masterpiece. Every actor is extremely talented, the story is great fun and the backdrops are cool.I'd rewatch if I were you :)", "Typically Tarantino, Both For Better And Worse.": "As with most Tarantino films, for me this had much to admire, some things that annoyed me, at least one thing that angered me (not in a good way), and confirmed yet again that he badly needs someone who will tell him to just edit it down, for goodness sake. Some disordered thoughts ...in all the commentary on this, I think DiCaprio is brilliant in this. He invests his character with so much, by doing so little. His speech impediment, occasionally showing itself and quickly compensated for, is a brilliant show don't tell of his character's laboriously hidden vulnerability and trauma. I think it may be one the best performances of a pretty stellar careersome of the set pieces, typically of Tarantino, are packed with tension and dread, that is never fully resolved ... and all the better for it. The extended scene at Spahn Ranch leaves a superbly constructed shadow hanging that only comes back at the film's end.that final segment of the film and its explosion of classically Tarantino-esque violence is one of the best sequences he's ever constructed. It reminds us just what greatness he's capable of.there are lots of shots of peoples' feet in this film. I have no idea why this is.there's no good reason for Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate to have so few lines. If people accuse a film-maker of misogyny, then you need to do better than this to disabuse people of the notion.similarly the inexplicable scene with Bruce Lee. Whether you buy the line that it's a warped fantasy of one of the main characters, or some kind of over-played cartoonish character-building interlude, it's unnecessary, lazy and racist.with regard to these last two points, I'm reminded (not for the first time with Tarantino) of the reviewer writing about Eminem who said 'he's clever, but not wise'.it's way too longI still really enjoyed most of itHe's so close to greatness that's it's becoming really frustrating. For your own sake, get some good people around you who will say no to you. Then you truly will be great again.", "WHAT A MAJOR, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT": "Once Upon a time...in Hollywood for Quentin Tarantino is a major disappointment for him and me. I've been a huge fan of Tarantino's works. But this homage to Hollywood simply goes nowhere. The final scene depicting horrendous violence inflicted on the girls was profoundly upsetting and disturbing. Tarantino went way too far. Not happy with this one.", "This is the epitome of a Tarantino movie, filled with style and indulgence and light on substance or purpose": "Whatever you've thought of Tarantino's previous films, you're likely to feel similarly about this one. The most pleasant surprise and difference for me was the humor - it was by far his funniest movie from start to finish, with great individual lines (\"we love pussy\" \"yes we do\") to great character moments (Rick giving himself a pep talk or the acid scene at the end). The jokes landed well, and there were a bunch. As you would expect, the performances were very good, especially Leo, who's excellent as the lead, and Pitt, who's also very convincing. Robbie's role was completely insignificant to the plot (though obviously central to the meaning and real story being referenced here), and regardless of the implications of her role, if she was nominated for best supporting actress for a small few unremarkable scenes, I would be extremely disappointed.\nMy biggest frustration with the film, as always, is with the third act. Much like in Django, it felt like Tarantino was really doing his best to hold back and make a nice, consistent movie, was going along... and just couldn't take it anymore and let it run absolutely wild in the last 20 minutes. Fully indulgent and over the top violence ensues in a way that makes the rest of the carefully crafted Manson story and character stories of Rick and Cliff feel less serious and legitimate. The relationship to the real murders felt fairly tangential, especially with the ending we see. I appreciate that Tarantino makes a clear effort to portray Tate not as a victim but as a real person, but given her complete irrelevance to the movie's story, I don't think it's completely impactful. Beyond the real life story which is its inspiration, it feels like a classic grand Tarantino with little substance or things that will stay with you. I don't regret watching it as it's funny and isn't boring, but is definitely meandering, and the juxtaposition between the ending and everything before didn't work at all for me.", "If you have insomnia then maybe give this a go": "Yawn. Not worth the time to even type this.Spoiler? Nothing happens to spoil!", "Powerful especially in recreating another era": "Hollywood, 1969: Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) had a lead role in a hit TV western in the 1950s and early 1960s. Since leaving that show, he is having a hard time finding decent work. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is Rick's friend and former stunt double. He also acts as Rick's chauffeur as Rick has had DUI charges. The fictional element of the time period is mixed with true events: Rick's next-door neighbours are actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski.Director/writer Quentin Tarantino has done a superb job in recreating the atmosphere of 1969. Those of us who were alive at that time, no matter how young, are left awestruck with sudden memory recall of people, places, and things that seemed completely erased from memory. The level of detail is praiseworthy enough yet there is also a recall of atmosphere that recreates the era sometimes even better than watching films from that time period.DiCaprio, always dependable, gives another standout performance easily conveying the insecurities of a \"has-been\" desperately trying to make a comeback. As DiCaprio is constantly in demand without ever experiencing a lower status, this is true acting.Much like Tarantino's \"Inglorious Basterds\", this current film mixes fiction with historical events with very surprising results. This adds to the thrilling suspense in the final sequence to those of us aware of history and are led to more than a few shocks and not just the extreme violence (this is a Tarantino film after all).\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" has many great segments. While they clearly relate to each other, there is a feeling at the end that the film was more a sum of great parts rather than a great whole. The length of over 2.5 hours seems excessive as well. But the segments themselves are very well made especially the final one that leaves much afterthought that follows the thrills. - dbamateurcritic", "Disappointing and pointless rewrite of history.": "The ending of this movie was a great fantasy... imagine if the Manson family members were killed by a soon to be out of work stuntman, who beats Bruce Lee in a fight, his dog and his aging actor boss... wow, I mean why not just imagine that the Vietnam War never happened and JFK/RFK/King were never assassinated? The problem is, they were and as much as we wish we could erase those events, we can't. This movie had a lot of promise, to be a behind the scenes glance into the obvious psychological issues associated with stardom and maybe show the Manson murders from the point of view of a Hollywood insider. Instead we got this rambling attempt at nostalgia.I read that Sharon Tate's sister gave this movie her blessing, and I understand why since the Manson family is portrayed as the dangerous monsters they are (although with probably a lot more wit than they possessed), the murderers get their full-on stuntman/pittie comeuppance, and, in the universe of the movie, her sister is still alive. This is the danger of a movie like this, where historical events are replaced by fantasy. The writer has a great responsibility to the people who are still around after and still hurting but also to the vast majority of the public now that doesn't remember or know about the Manson murders. I worry, that with the way things are now people will substitute in fantasy outcomes for the real thing, especially if they were never familiar with the events in the first place.All that said, Dicaprio and Pitt are great. All the actors give spot on (if not all to brief) portrayals of their famous characters although I do take issue with how Bruce Lee is portrayed in terms of attitude but voice and mannerism is uncanny.Many other writer/directors have taken huge liberties with portrayals of historical events, putting in purely fictional sequences and very \"alternative\" sequences. Usually though, the overall story remains intact ... or... like in Inglorious Basterds, whose ending is pure fantasy (yet it somehow worked better than this).", "The worst movie ever": "He made a movie for the last scene to satisfy his need for blood and violance...I waited story evolve but there is no story telling, nothing interesting at all...there is no artistic approach. its rubbish...", "Not that Great": "Great acting, Great Visuals, love the older feel, Great ending.

I went knowing that there would be an abundance of ultra violence but strangely it was not the case, well at least not for most of the movie. Viewing Once Upon A Time in Hollywood was an extremely slow drawn out experience and I found I had plenty of time to fidget around and looking at my watch etc.The two main characters in the film DiCaprio and Pitt are probably what holds this movie headache together, Al Pacino's role is forgettable whilst Tarantino's directing is a bit patchy although some shots/angles were compelling.The last quarter of this long, long, long movie is where it will score brownie points from critics and moviegoers alike, shall say in true Tarantino style.In a messed up world we live in 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' is sure to add more trash to our subconscious mind set.", "Maybe it's time Tarantino retired after all": "No motivation for any of the action up until the final act. Margot Robbie could have been entirely eliminated from the film and it wouldn't have changed a thing except saving us 40 minutes. Without Pitt's character this might have been a razzie. Love Tarantino but I'm no longer sad he's calling it quits.", "Beautiful recreation of a timeless era - but the movie may not be for everyone": "This movie has to be, at the very least, appreciated by the work that goes into recreating the Hollywood prime era and the 60s in L.A.\nIn a time where everything is done via CGI, to be able to pull off a transformation like this on such iconic streets as Hollywood Boulevard... it is really remarkable.The story that then ensues in that context about a downward-spiralling actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his stunt double Rick Booth (Pitt) is not exactly gripping, I can get that, but it was incredibly entertaining for me to watch.The reason I only give it 8/10 is because I can see how, for someone who has never heard about Charles Manson for example, the story may be just as mundane any other script. Which can perhaps throw some people off (in spite of the brilliant acting).\nThat and perhaps the long-run time.However, even you don't appreciate stories about the mundane life of two actors, than it is still very much worth to stick around for the classic Tarantino climax that takes place in the last half hour or so of the movie.", "Random plotlines that mostly fizzle and disappoint": "Much like Tarantino's mind...random, disjointed, meandering, and mostly pointless. The plot wanders all over the place and never really lands anywhere. The ending does have a plot twist that rewrites history in way I'm sure is preferable, but I think it was just a desperate attempt on Tarantino's part to juice up an otherwise yawn of a way too drawn out screenplay.\nThere's no real character development and many dead ends.", "Disjointed": "It had a lot of cool characters and scenes, unfortunately they seemed disconnected.

I've watched all of his movies 3 or 4 times. This one I just couldn't justify watching again. I waited and waited for a plot to start but it never did. This is a film for filmmakers to watch and enjoy if they can get past a lack of tension. I get that this is a time period movie... It looked very good. I get it... we're in the late 60's.

Acting was fantastic but without a good story this movie falls flat and becomes really boring really fast.", "Pointlessness Masked As Cinema": "Prefaces: QT fan, will sit through most films to see where the director is going, etcReview: Even after several clicks of the fast-forward button, this movie was still too long, pointless, boring. And this is coming from someone who sat through Cloud Atlas.

I had high expectations from Tarantino on this one since he had all the ingredients to make a masterpiece working in his territory. A great cast, an era and city he knows very well and a good plot however were not mixed in the right order to achieve a good result.\nThe movie is slow and boring, with some random Tarantino style dialogues and very bad cutting that makes the continuity questionable.\nBard Pitt is fantastic and an amazing Di Caprio performance is not enjoyable because of the lack of interest the directors manage to create around his character.

It portrays the egos of the actors, how the industry worked at that time, the different positions of the actors in Hollywood and portrays the blur of activism in those times. The script of this film manages to develop the characters immensely, giving each one a moment to shine, conveying their emotions and their goals in life, the performances emanate quality and commitment on the part of the actors by completely getting into the skin of the characters, the production design makes me feel at that time by being meticulous in every detail of each set in the film, the photography manages to beautifully capture every detail of the location or the set including a very striking mix of colors. The third act is the best because you realize that each scene had a purpose, and that together everything works perfectly.It's a great movie, with a message of love for Hollywood in the sixties, with a narrative that takes time to decipher its purpose, but that turns out to be wonderful together with everything else.", "A surprisingly flat effort from Le Q": "I finally watched Once Upon A Time...in Hollywood last evening. Awesome cast, interesting setting and premise, this promised to be one of Le Q's best films. What it is is an (almost) complete disappointment. There is little driving the narrative. Leo plays Rick Dalton, a waning Hollywood actor who struggles to find bad-guy roles on TV series; Pitt plays his stunt man who, because Dalton's career is cratering, is similarly getting little work; and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, whose star is ascending. Robbie has little to do here other than to walk around like eye candy. Leo's character is all weeping and self-pity - and since when has THAT made interesting drama? Characters go after something; Leo's Dalton gets weepy at the slightest whiff of failure. Pitt, however, is engaging. He knows he's on the skids, but he keeps plugging away, making the most of every desperate situation.Le Q has a taste for endless scenes. In this film, it's just tiresome. There is a long sequence in which Robbie's Tate happens on a theater that is showing one of her movies. Nothing happens other than she sees the theater, considers going in, chats with the ticket seller, chats with the usher, takes a seat, watches the film and reacts when the audience enjoys her performance. It's all intended to point out how self-obsessed Tate was or, I suppose, how insecure. But why does this require so much screen time?Other segments are utterly hammy and poorly directed. Much of Le Q's film Inglorious Basterds as similarly hammy and unbelievable. Here, a funny sequence in which Pitt kicks Bruce Lee's ass is marred by heavy overacting from most of the cast.I could go on. Suffice it to say, this one's a disappointment, despite Pitt's good work. Maybe this film would have been better if it had just focused on Pitt's character, with the others incidental. As it is, it's a yarny mess. And fairly uninteresting to boot.", "Worse movie that I ever saw in my life": "I was really excited to watch this movie but it was such a waste of time.

I'm not a fan of most Tarantino movies, but he knocked this one out of the park. I have a tendency to fall asleep watching any movie that fails to fully interest me, and I stayed wide awake for Once Upon a Time...A truly stunning film: It's clear to me that no expense was spared in its making.A little backstory: I had read Helter Skelter many years ago as a teenager, so I knew all the details of the Manson family and their history. The ending of the movie was creative, to say the least! Before seeing it, I was already aware of how it ended, and I initially thought it would seem contrived.

In fact, I have not enjoyed a movie theater experience this much in some time. Yes, it is too long. Yes, it seems more than a little scattered structurally. BUT it is also Tarantino at his semi-best. If you want someone to make a nostalgic film with a late-60s soundtrack that re-imagines a historical moment, places movie stardom in a new light, and brings a perfect balance of creepiness and comedy, well, he is absolutely your guy. Just as importantly, DiCaprio and Pitt are your guys for these roles. They find every comedic and cathartic moment without becoming too one dimensional, and I just could not help but watch them. I probably would have enjoyed a tighter and more consistent version of this movie...but then there would have been less of it to love.", "Probably Tarantino's most personal film but it is also his most clunky and unorganized": "'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' feels like an epilogue. Tarantino above anything else has been a movie fan and with this film he actually has made a movie not just about films and filmmaking but the kind of religious romanticization of the culture. Make no mistake the Hollywood portrayed here never existed, this is Tarantino's dream world. What is created here is a fantasy and a fairy tale very appropriately hinted at from it's title. The devout Tarantino fans are going to love this film and appreciate the extreme attention to detail. The end result here is a very esoteric film loaded to the brim with easter eggs and shout outs that sometimes take precedence over an already narratively thin premise. What one gets out of 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' will depend on how much of the Hollywood history and Manson lore you know.The film has a very episodic nature to it. We go through various events with our characters that show off the Hollywood sets and streets. That isn't meant as a big complaint because a lot of the individual stores work and work well. Tarantino has always sort of broken down his larger projects into individual vignettes and chapters. I just feel that in this particular instance there doesn't seem to be a central thread weaving our plot lines together. One would think that with 1969 being the heart of the film that Tarantino would use the juxtaposition of Manson and Hollywood's golden age ending to say something. It serves as nothing more than a backdrop. It's a fun backdrop, don't get me wrong but not a thematic one.There's no getting around the fact that in discussing this film you have to discuss how Tarantino handled Sharon Tate's murder. Does he earn the right to rewrite history yet again to fit his artistic vision? It's a tough discussion to have and I feel as if Tarantino is getting a lot less slack. Sharon Tate died a horrible death and just reading about it gives you a visceral reaction. Tarantino knows this and uses it to draw us in. A cloud of dread hangs over the entire movie as we wait for Tate to meet her horrific fate. Margot Robbie's Tate really isn't given a whole lot to say or do over the course of the film but she has a screen presence full of warmth or beauty. Tarantino films Robbie with reverence almost like a religious figure. I can't really say if his ending works or not in the scope of what it adds to Tate as a character in this film or as a tribute to the real Sharon Tate. In all honesty it felt a little awkward.I do have to give Tarantino credit where credit is due. For the large part Tarantino does not make a character out of Manson or his family members. I think that works to his advantage. Like I said Tarantino knows we know the story and so going in Manson already has a presence over the film. We really don't need to see the Helter Skelter stuff again. It's just too depressing and vile and no amount of Tarantino dialogue could make it zany.'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's great appeal is the aesthetics. You can argue that Tarantino may have peaked as a storyteller but there still isn't anyone who can set a mood or create a world as well as him. This film should be a shoe in for set design and costuming awards.I have not mentioned the performances or the characters really. DiCaprio and Pitt are both serviceable in their roles. DiCaprio has to work the most because a lot of his character is built from subtext. His best moments come when his Rick Dalton acts and DiCaprio brings Dalton's insecurities out into the character Dalton himself is playing. Pitt's character is a little too vague but his charisma is still there.I think I've probably over dissected this. The simple answer with Tarantino seems to be that his fans will love anything he does and I think 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' will be no exception. An 'Inglorious Basterds' it is not and yet 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' gives the Tarantino fan the chance to enter his dreams of an idealized movie fantasy.", "Well you know This is Tarantino!!!!!!": "A Morden Masterpiece That stays with you but in a very good way. This film is for all kind of audience As they will sit for the whole runtime, they won't get disappointed. Tarantino is genius in the storytelling as his powerful screenplay plays with you for almost 2 hours. This kind of films Have great screenplay for almost no storyline yet powerful watching experience.Leonardo Di caprio as Rick Dalton is his best tarantino performance. He literally lives the character. We can actually fells the same way at some point of time. The craft of his is inevitable. Brad pitt as the same time is at his top form delivering his tarantino best performance (this one is true i guess). The whole ensemble cast played their respective roles beautifully.Writing is the heart of the film and The Sound design, cinematography which actually lets yoy fell that you are in the 1969. Walking shots are lot of there as there as so many tarantino styled shots been used to make this film more and more iconic. This film holds a hell of a cinematic experience i have ever experienced after la la land in such in its own space.Do watch it in the cinemas8 Stars out of 10.A Must Watch!", "Created an account just to write this review...": "I love QT movies. But this can't really be a QT movie. Must have been about the most pointless script, worst editing making it even slower then your average swedish film (and I'm European, we like slow movies) , ridiculous character development (if any), absolutely useless parodies of actual stars (Bruce Lee, Steve McQueen et al). First time ever I actually walked out of a tarentino movie.", "Bruce Lee's Portrayal shows QT is just another white supremacist": "How does QT justify his horrid portrayal of Lee by stating 'it was true,' when he portrays Steve McQueen, Jay Sebring, and Sharon Tate as great ppl (when they were not), especially given Lee is the only non-white character in the film. I've lost all respect for QT after this and his hypocritical explanation of Lee's portrayal", "So sorry": "No plot. No meaning what so ever. Worst Tarantino movie", "Too self indulgent for most": "As a fan of Tarantino I looked forward to this... only to be shocked that 2 and a half hours after it started very little had actually happened.\nWe're expected to be wowed by QTs love of 60s westerns and just accept that that as a sub plot makes for a good film... throw in some Manson family bits the re-write the Sharon Tate story.? It's mildly entertaining but way too long for this little plot and direction.", "I must have watched a different movie": "I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was in this movie.\nIt was a bunch of really great actors/acting in search of a story.\nFrom the first 20 minutes I knew this was going to be a reimagining of the Tate/LaBianca murders, but getting to that point was laborious and circuitous.I, like so many others, have been a Tarantino fan for decades, however this movie did not deliver.\nObviously, great acting by Pitt, DiCaprio, and crew, but this was the worst of all the annoying Tarantinoesque story telling quirks. Unnecessary voiceover, plot lines that go nowhere or never get developed, too much exposition-aspects that in his other movies we've been willing to overlook because the story was so COMPELLING.Not only was the movie way too long (I am on board w/length if in-service of character or plot development), but this movie was essentially 2 stories ineffectually melded together.I think he must have been smoking some of his \"acid cigarettes\" and got to thinking \"Hey, what if Sharon Tate's next-door neighbor was some washed up actor and somehow intervened in the murder and she never died\", and then that became the movie.The story itself deserved 0 stars, but because it was great to see Brad again and because Leo never disappoints, I had to give one star for each of them (and hey, Kurt Russel is still smokin!).Garbage.", "Empty": "So ok there was a lot of work and attention to detail put in there to recreate the 60s but if that was all i came for i would have watched a documentary about it instead. There is no real / interesting story to the film and besides 3 or 4 characters the others act quite badly. It is all a bit slow and the twist at the end which could have the been the central piece of the story was just an excuse for Tarantino style violence.", "Enjoyable Movie But Not Tarantino's Best": "The time flew by while viewing the movie, so it didn't seem like 2 hours and 40 minutes. I enjoyed the movie, but it cannot touch Pulp Fiction, not in a long shot. I enjoyed the 1960s atmosphere and music, and it brought back fond memories. The movie had true-to-life characters who you could relate to. DiCaprio and Pitt were at their best. The movie was violent, but violent movies do not scare me. I am sorry that the movie did not thoroughly visit with Charlie and other members of the Manson family. Good movie, but not Tarantino's best.", "A terrible insult!": "I was so disappointed in this film! I love the 60s era, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie and DiCaprio and was excited about the stellar cast and look and feel of this film. What a waste! Boring, long, pointless and self indulgent! The Sharon Tate murders were dealt with in appallingly bad taste! Basically, Tarantino changed history! Imagine the family of the murdered people watching this film?! How insulting! After this, and the dreadful The Hateful Eight, I'm done with Tarantino!", "Ugh": "This film was something I have been looking forward to for months and damn...was that disappointing. Leo, Brad, Margot were wonderful, loved the theme, great cinematography, and superb music per usual. I was just sad to say this was his worst film and wouldn't recommend spending the $$ to watch in theaters. On the bright side my popcorn was fresh and perfectly buttered though.", "It goes on and on and then ...BAM!! Nostalgic feeling for all lost beautiful things still prevails....": "Could have been shorter, had a slooow start wirh many \"fillers\" concerning Hollywood film details and stars from 50 years ago, but the core of the story is real Tarantino and that is revenge and punishment for a hideous crime the murderers committed ( although in this case the perpetrators get punished for something they have not done yet..., that is just a somewhat sad fantasy of the author...unfortunately the innocence incorporated - the gorgeous Sharon Tate / perfectly impersonated by Margot Robbie/ got killed in real life together with other completely innocent people /, the murderers would have surely deserved such punishment for what they REALLY did....but happy endings happen only in Hollywood, not in real life. This revenge/punishment theme reminds me pretty much of Kill Bill, not so much of Pulp Fiction...I also think it was Tarantino \u00c2\u00b4s purpose to show Sharon as an innocent, naive, beautiful girl...that is why Margot does not talk much in the movie...she is supposed to represent a symbol....I liked the film, but would not watch it for the second time, the beginning had too many themes and was very slow...still, it left a sad feeling of nostalgia for all beautiful things lost in time....", "The third great movie this year": "Joker, The Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood are three majestic movies. To get all three in one year is special. OUATIH had me wondering just what Tarantino was going to do with DiCaprio and Pitt in a movie. I'd heard that the movie is a homage to Hollywood and Los Angeles circa 1969 and that's what it proved to be. People have moaned that it's boring. Well it's not Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction or any other of Tarantino's movies. It's affectionate, funny, sometimes sad and ultimately it finishes on a the kind of a bang that those of us of a certain age would find most satisfactory. It's a long movie but always engrossing. DiCaprio and Pitt deliver and there's real chemistry between them. DiCaprio plays a TV Western star who's slowly coming up to his sell-by date. Pitt his friend, gofer and stuntman. DiCaprio's character, Rick Dalton, is depressed, a borderline alcoholic, desperate that his career never rose above the TV level (he does some Italian westerns for exposure and the money and ends up with an Italian bride and not much money due to his lifestyle in Rome). Brad Pitt's character, Cliff Booth, is as realistic as Brad Dalton is as a cowboy. He's eternally smiling, happy to run his friend around, do odd jobs around Brad's house and can kick a$$ really well - he even gets to kick Bruce Lee's a$$ in the movie so realism is not the first priority but he is a lot of fun to watch.Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate and her character is presented as someone angelic, very sweet and so excited about her film roles. As the movie ran on I decided that I really did not want to see her butchered so I gave up on it. I then discovered that Tarantino had done what he had done with Inglorious Basterds and changed history. I'll just say that the climax of the movie will make many people cheer (especially for the four-legged star), I know I did!This has become my favorite Tarantino movie and it demonstrates beautifully that the guy can write with a lot of affection as well as being quite vicious in his writing. This is not a film for those who need lots of hardcore Tarantino.The end title music is from the end titles of The Life and Times Of Judge Roy Bean and is a beautiful piece of music by Maurice Jarre. It's the perfect end to a nearly perfect movie. This movie deserves to be considered in the same class as Joker and The Irishman, it's that good.", "Wow! I can't believe how crap this was!": "As a Tarantino fan I was excited to see this movie but WOW! Utter rubbish! Yes the acting was good and he had assembled an A list cast of some of my favorite actors but man were they wasted... like the 3 hours of my life I'll never get back...\nit was so bad I almost walked out several times from boredom, they story is just rubbish and just a complete waste of time.\nI disliked this movie so much that I signed up to imdb just to write this review, seriously, don't waste your time or money.", "\"Hooray for Hollywood, where you're terrific if you're even good\"": "The events leading to the Tate-LaBianca murders are paralleled in this clever 'alternate history' comedy from the perspective of Tate's next-door neighbour Rick Dalton, a fading TV-western star (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt-double/buddy/dogsbody Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The film is a typical Tarantino pop-culture melange: kinetic, dead-pan, violent, and beautifully lensed. The recreation of glaring, garish 60s Hollywood is excellent and the cast is uniformly great. The whole film is a bit of an inside joke and I may not have 'got' all of it, but I got enough to really like Tarantino's slightly bent ode to a the end of the gold-plated age of film-making.", "garbage pure & simple": "The movie is total garbage its 70s spoof .Waste of good actors & actresses ,taking the mickey out of the most disturbing murders in the history of Hollywood is taking cinema to a new level ,the movie is boring ,wooden & totally stupid , don't waste your money or time and really the movie should have stayed in the can.", "Probably the worst Tarantino Movie": "I am a huge fan of Quintin Tarantino.. and I must say I'm quite disappointed.", "A loving ode to 60s Hollywood.": "Wow. What an experience it was. Tarantino literally delivers everything one expects. It is funny, thrilling, and features very good dialogues like in every Tarantino movies. All the cast did an excellent job led by the super Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. They were truly phenomenal. Margot Robbie also did a good job as Sharon Tate. Watching OUATIH gave me this rare feeling which I cannot express in words. Maybe it's old Hollywood nostalgia. Overall, this movie is not for everyone but for true cinema lovers.", "VIEWS ON FILM review of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood": "\"That was the best acting I've ever seen in my whole life\". Uh, not quite Leonardo DiCaprio but you'll always be one of my favorite stars in this lifetime or the next. DiCaprio and a host of well-known troupers (with amorphous cameos) litter the screen in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Anyway, \"Hollywood\" is a kaleidoscope of nostalgic images, a cinematic objet d'art if you will. It's the 9th film from legendary helmer Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino will never make anything as good as 1994's Pulp Fiction. He knows it and we know it. Basically, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood dutifully escorts that trend. \"Hollywood\" while harboring a whole lot of movie (within a movie), meanders in shape and overall form. Made to order as Q.T.'s powered final cut, it's probably one of the most scattered editorial efforts in his 27-year canon.In Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Tarantino uses every directorial trick in the book (and even some stuff borrowed from other filmmakers). Quentin's sense of time and place is luscious (Hollywood, CA circa 1969), he loves to film old TV sets (and grubby feet), he rocks some obscure music, his attention to detail is totally enterprising, and he gives us a balls-out surprise ending. It's just too bad \"Hollywood\" doesn't know what it wants to be or what it really wants to say. 161 minutes go by and there's a final act of gratuitous violence that Tarantino is quintessentially known for. Howbeit, said graphic violence doesn't quite bind together what feels like mostly a kooky comedy/drama.Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing and containing some tacked on narration by Kurt \"Snake Plissken\" Russell, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood involves washed-up actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), and the Charles Manson saga involving the real-life Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Tarantino intertwines their stories through flashbacks, lasting back and forth cuts, reworked history, and Tinseltown ins and outs. The actors take it sternly, the production designers do their job, and Tarantino knows where to put the camera a la every dewy-eyed frame. Still, \"Hollywood\" beats its own drum and provides the audience member with an uneven viewing experience. Might I suggest watching Robert Altman's The Player instead. Rating: 2 and a half stars.", "2,5hours i never get back": "Well the movie is 2h 41min but its only 11 minutes that actualy worth watching.\nI had really looking forward for this movie, and lets just say its not worth 4$ rent", "Stupid beyond stupid": "I found not one single thing about this movie entertaining. Just plain stupid in every way. Tarantino sucks. He needs to retire. The best thing about this crap fest was when the end credits started. What a joke. I repeat: Tarantino SUCKS!!!", "I never thought i would say this about a movie with Leo in lead...": "I honestly wanted to leave, this movie litterly goes nowhere! Every scene has you thinking \"where are they going with this\" Eventually i stopped caring and started to get angry as everything got dragged out.The acting is top notch, the story is almost non existant...", "What a waste of time!": "Two hours wasted of waiting for the movie to actually get going, only to see Brad and his dog kill the hippy intruders in a classic Tarantino way during the final minutes of the movie.Outside of the big names, this is in my mind nothing to get excited by.", "I genuinely think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen": "I loved dicaprio and Pitt in the movie and the movie did have its funny moments and a couple of great acting moments. That being said, it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, wasn't thrilling enough to be a thriller, and wasn't enough plot points to be a drama. It was barely even a movie considering the fact that there was essentially no plot. It was also so long I'd rather watch a cheesy 5/10 rated comedy on Netflix. The fact that this was nominated for an Oscar just shows me that the oscars are rigged.", "Just watch": "Just go and watch, you don't need to figure anything out, is he? Does he? Some people left the theatre before the end but it's brilliant, yes your waiting for something to happen and it does, but just just watch. it's sad, funny, clever, nostalgic, beautiful, tragic. The ending is touching and would have been wonderful if true.", "Any other director would get 5 or less stars": "There was a good ending to this movie. That is just about the only good thing i can say about it. But the first 2 hours and 15 minutes are a complete yawn. Sharon Tates story never connected to the rest of the movie. In fact, if you dont know who she was in real life or the story of manson you will not understand at all why she was in the film. There was no real plot to this movie at all. The only moment of suspense is when the manson family arrives at the end to kill people. YOU WILL ONLY SEE MANSON ONCE and only for a few seconds in this movie. The movie is not about him or his story at all but rather about a failing actor and his stunt double. Having said that, there is no plot development because there is no plot so for over 2 hours you will sit wondering what the movie is about or what is supposed to happen. I love QT movies but this was by far his worst. There were no interesting dialogues that we have grown used to from him. The high ratings for this movie are ONLY because he directed it. Any other director and this movie would be hailed as a complete flop.", "Waited for a plot": "Plot never showed up. Disconnected story that went nowhere", "Tate in the movie": "A lot of people seem to be saying the scenes were Sharon Tate in the movie were pointless and a waste of time: they are missing the point. It is assumed that the viewer knows the story and the scenes with Tate are there to build sympathy and suspense with the character who you think will be murdered, but of course, in Tarantino's fairytale makeover of history, we will get to see the bad guys get there just comeuppance and Tate and the others live happily ever after, as we feel it should have been.", "Say it ain't so": "First off, huge Tarentino fan. All his other films were unique, although this film just had no plot whatsoever. Just like pulling things put of the air.", "LA DEE DAH": "Everyone is king smart and full of themselves. They have the last word.", "Absolutely Phenomenal": "From the previous reviewers this movie has a definite love hate relationship. I thought the movie was great! I loved the attention to detail the radio station in the background. Anyone over 50 that grew up in Los Angeles should love the trip back. Yes there was storyline did the other reviews that hated this movie want blood and gore like reservoir dogs? You got that in the fight scene between Charlie's followers and Brad Pitt. I appreciate the handling of Sharon Tate and the twist on the ending.", "A slow, washed out, fairytale of sorts": "The film of alternate histories takes its time to build up atmosphere and character, but at an astonishing 2h 41min feels too slow with some (a lot of) material that doesn't really advance the plot. That is why it is also uneven, with distinct variance in tone and not without its flat patches. It is watchable, but I don't want to re-seen it again or buy it. I was mostly entertained by it, but it is a bit of a mess. Bruce Lee is little bit more cartoonish than rest of characters and didn't come off well, while Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) comparing to male characters feels a little bit flat. I just felt unsatisfied after it was finish. Love him or not, when you're watching a Tarantino movie, you know it is a Tarantino film. I'm just not a big fan of his.Rating: 6/7- just because of fantastic and hard to achieve effortless Brad Pitt", "Anti-climactic - Over-extended snoozefest": "It just didnt have the oomph factor of Tarantino's prior work. Long-winded scenes with characters that really didnt lead anywhere substantial towards major plot development.Plus the Bruce Lee scene was just terribly conceived and unbelievable. Nobody in the past or the now present honestly believes Bruce Lee would actively pick a fight to try show off, nor lose a fight to some low level \"stunt\" double.Anyone that knew him or read about Bruce Lee's life knows he faced racism and discrimination all his life and teached his Jeet Kune Do as a means to bridge the gap between American and Chinese xenophobia (He taught black, white, minorities his kung-fu for peet's sake)Tarantino being a film history buff and all, definitely missed the mark in this regard. Portraying someone with such a storied background like Bruce Lee (a pioneer and legend in many cinematic regards) in a film like this, one would think extensive research is needed. It is a dishonor and a disservice to not only the dead, but to yourself as a filmmaker.Tarantino's portrayal of old Hollywood in all its Technicolor glory gives the audience a nostalgic romp for the end of an era yet it is still a saturated, inaccurate picture filled with bloated, over-extended scenes that doesn't quite deliver in his usual gut-punch style.", "Easily the worst movie by Tarantino": "I have to start out by saying that I am a huge Tarantino fan. That being said, it still wasn't enough to get even me to like this movie. It just seemed like it was trying so hard to be another Tarantino classic, but was coming up way short in all aspects. Nothing exciting ever really happened. To be honest, the only reason that I was able to finish this movie was because I kept giving Tarantino the benefit of the doubt, and just kept assuming (hoping really) that it would eventually get better. Boy was I disappointed. Even the climax was a dud. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Definitely not worth spending two and a half hours on. Thumbs down.", "Worst movie ever, waste of time": "I don't know how to introduce you my feelings about this movie. I have never been bored more then when I watched it.", "Strong bloody violence": "Firstly, when the title card shows 'strong bloody violence' it always make me laugh because it sounds really British. Quite often it's the only time I laugh at the cinema, for OUATIH, this was not true.The girls was hilarious, really, truly funny. Leo is consistently bad ass, and as Rick Dalton playing the heavy in the pilot for Lancer, he excelled himself. Brad looked weird, but was still hot, and the Bruce Lee fight cracked me up.The third act loomed over me all the way through, I was anxious about how they would show the Sharon Tate murder, and when you knew the night would involve Cliff on acid and Brandy the dog, I started to hide behind my hands and in my head I was convinced something terrible would befall Shazza T, and Brandy the magnificent.But that's what I was supposed to think, because we all know what really happened, and it's so gruesome and sad, that it was hilarious to see the parallel universe Tarrentino graphic violence version, where everything is ok, and the flame thrower steals the show.Truly solid word, a soliloquy to the hay day of Hollywood. A beautiful and gruesome fairytale.LOVED IT. I mean, it's no Pulp Fiction, but to paraphrase another reviewer, you can only judge Hanzo swords by other Tarrantino films, and this is in no way Jackie Brown.", "Brilliant.": "This is one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of our lifetimes. It is in fact, as close to perfect as a movie can get. It must be considered Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus.", "Well...": "Bruce Lee scene was probably the best part. Ending was good. The other 2 hours and 25 minutes you're probably going to wonder what you're watching. Definitely a step down from his recent flicks, but worth a watch for fans.", "Hollywood Actor asks young girl age before taking advantage of her!": "Yeah right, this was the fantasy part of the movie.", "QT's ninth and finest film": "A transcendent film experience. Yet again QT reels off a masterpiece for our viewing pleasures. With a phenomenal trio of leading actors, Leo, Brad Pit, and Margot Robbie, the audience is captivated from the very first frame.", "Do yourself a favor and skip it.": "There is no story. No connection with actors.\nProduction is amazing. Enjoyed last 10 minutes. What a wasted opportunity with two legends. I agree with Mr. Tarantino that he has given all he had to movies. He can stop at 9.", "Worth the wait, budget and Anticipation!": "Unlike most of the anticipated, big budget and most awaited films, it is a treat. No comparison with Phulo Fiction, but it does kinda reminds of that. Has the charm that was found in Inglorious Bastards and Django Unchained.", "Not quite the Tarantino tale you were looking for": "Like most of Tarrantino films there are some moments of genius cinematography (such as the falsely portrayed bad editing) and story telling but unfortunately this film has some long lulls in-between those moments.The story of Sharon Tate is absolutely baffling and leads nowhere within the film other than making her look like a complete bimbo and just seems to be a love letter to fellow director Roman Polanski rather than any story within the film. Are you supposed to think that Rick Dalton gains a few more years of grace in Hollywood due to having a drink with her after the credits roll? Unlikely seeing as there is a minor plot during the credits that would suggest not. Just utterly confusing as to what part she played in the film other than eye candy.The culmination of plots lead up to a satisfying Tarantinoesque finale with some gruesome moments of violence in it but does it warrant the watch? I enjoyed it for the most but definitely felt that the pacing for the first 60-90 minutes was hardly memorable and somewhat tedious. That being said, if you enjoy Tarantino's previous works you'll likely enjoy this, just not as much a some of his other films.", "Tarantino with a few violence": "It starts on the ste of the movie.Very good performances from Pitt and Di Caprio and a cameo from the veteran Pacino.The film puts us in the climate of the era,with the cars the bars and the people of spectacle.A little bizarre finale.But all in all a fine film.", "What,,, Is this junk??": "I get that Tarantino takes liberties but to phase it correctly,,,\"Come On Man!!\"\nI would have never watched this movie at the theater and Quentin Tarantino moves are usually hit or miss.\nThis is definitely a miss.", "What a waste !": "Really ! I have tried to be positive about Tarantino , but apart from Pulp Fiction and D'jango unchained I find his films overly talkative just for the sake of dialogue . I wasted 2 hours of my life recently watching this poor excuse of a film . The acting was spot on and despite their efforts I just found it boring and lazy . Shoehorning movie references and cameos does not make a good film , or a very entertaining one . I really hope that Tarantino retires now and people will stop fawning over this so-called auteur !

Also awfully long.", "Nothing more than pretentious": "This movie is a perfect example of the director's name superseding the quality of the film itself in terms of critical reception.I'm convinced that 99% of the people who gave this movie a 10/10 simply can't stand admitting one of their favorite, adored directors spat out this self-congratulatory, egotistical snooze-fest.As many others have astutely pointed out, if ANYONE other than QT had tried to get this script (if you can even call it that) made, they'd be kicked to curb faster than you can say \"hollywood fanboy.\"", "Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen": "I like Quentin Tarantino enough - I liked Django Unchained for example. This movie however was one of the worst if not the worst movies I've ever seen.The first two hours are almost literally pointless. Completely pointless. I didn't know the Manson family background beforehand so I was even more confused (0 story telling).The last 30 minutes are absurdly over the top ridiculous. Did I need to see Brad Pitt bash a young girls face in ... Over and over and over and over and over? So gratuitous for no reason.Worst of all that past the two hour mark I didn't even care what happened. Does someone get murdered? Does something crazy happen? Who cares? I didn't care about the characters at all and there was no story or buildup. Tarantino's solution? Complete over the top brutality for 10 minutes. Cool.Laziest writing I've ever seen in my life with literally zero effect on the viewer except disgust. Certainly will never see another Tarantino movie again because those are 2.5 hours I already regret losing in my life.", "This is a great movie people!": "Tarantino done it again! Pitt and Di Caprio together are amaizing duo,incredible!\nI liked the story,the writings-the whole thing is just unpredictible and of course it has to be bloody because hell!This is Tarantino!Just give it a try,if you dont like the movie in a first hour then you are just not the right person for this kind of movie.", "Tried, but can't": "I've been thinking about watching it for a long time. And finally I tried it. To be honest, it's a very boring movie. Although I am very amazed, because Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are filming there! I was clearly expecting something more.

Just waste your time.", "Tarantino telling story about Charles Manson...really??": "Well 1st of all, the only spoiler in this movie is that it is simply opposite of what Tarantino movies have been till date...not seen such a meaningless and aimless movie in a very long time. So, anyone trying to be over smart movie critic with their comments like \"A tarantino masterpiece\" or \"Not for everyone\" and blah blah, just ask them the motto of this blunt movie....apart from buttering Tarantino and showing off their wannabe critic's talents, they won't be able to utter a single concrete explanation for this dump.Watch it only if want to watch another movie making inside a movie and getting ur head busted by boredom. Avoid it particularly, if you are going with ambition of gaining some knowledge about Charles Manson, his hippie gang and their animosity with Sharon Tate etc. coz there is none.2 stars only for Brad Pitt....plus I am still trying to figure out WTH was Sharon Tate doing in this movie as neighbor to Rick Dalton.", "A tribute to Hollywood from Mr. Tarantino": "I think this movie is pretty good...yeah it's not like his other movies..this is a beautiful comedy drama but it's slow paced..you have to keep patience to enjoy it fully.\nThe movie's main character Rick Dalton, who is a faded star are trying to connect with the new phase of Hollywood...now he got only typecast villian roles in tv series and movies and he also trying to adjust with the new Hollywood and the other side we got Cliff Booth,who is Rick Dalton's stuntman and a very close friend..and I like his story better than Rick's...and we also got Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, that time Roman Polanski's wife..she had a very little role in the film. Brad Pitt and Leonardo Caprio both are terrific..and Quentin as always his direction is great..and I loved it how he connectd the Hollywood with the Manson family to add some familiar Tarantino staff..\nI love this movie..ah one point some people don't like Bruce Lee-Cliff Booth crossover thinks that it is a insult to the greatest Bruce Lee...I don't think that,I see the tribute Quentin gives to Bruce Lee with this funny scene with Booth..there is nothing disrespectful to Bruce Lee.\nThe actor playing Bruce Lee is amazing and I have a issue if I could see little more Pacino...ok that's it.", "No plot, good scenes and acting": "The has no apparent plot.It turns out that you have to know about some killins that a guy named Charlie Manson plotted at that time, make sure to learn about that before watching the movie. And that only improves the movie the first time you watch it.On the bright side the performances of the actors are perfect and there are four scenes that I absolutely love.", "What a let down": "I just keep thinking to myself \"when is this movie going to start?\" Reminded me of the Oscar's, 25 minutes of entertainment.....spread over a 3 hour period. Do yourself a favor, don't go see it in theaters, wait until it comes out on Blu-ray,\nand don't buy it.", "Boring and way too long": "Don't understand the acclaim for this movie- I'm a Tarantino fan but this movie apart from the last 10 minutes is boring, the first hour at least is character development that should have taken 10 minutes!Brad Pitt did well with what was given to him but the rest of the \"names\" in the cast seemed to be there to say wow, how many top actors are in my film!I hope Tarantino makes another movie to redeem himself before retiring!", "Nostalgic Ride": "Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt make for a fantastic duo in another amazing Tarantino picture. This one hits all of the staples you expect from Quentin: macabre violence, sharp and witty dialogue, and an outlandish but still believable plot that threads multiple different eccentric characters together in a colorful world.Where it lacks a little for me is the sheer amount of old school Hollywood callbacks. A lot of them are great; I love seeing Leo digitally inserted into a scene from \"The Great Escape.\" But it gets to be a little much at points. We make a very sharp transition from a love letter to old Hollywood to a much more interesting alternate history story about the Manson family.It seems like two plots sandwiched together into one, and I'd have preferred if Tarantino stuck to the Manson family and gutted a few things to make it flow a little easier.", "A Modern, Revisionist, Western Fairy Tale": "As far as I'm (and I'm sure many others are) concerned, this is a two part movie. Both are quintessentially Tarantino. The first part of the film is filled with nostalgia and entertainment. It is an almost two hour love affair with the imperfect Hollywood of the 1960s and more specifically the part of Hollywood concerned with Westerns. It is no secret that Tarantino sees the Western genre as hugely influential to himself and it seems as though he is trying to pay homage to it and the culture around the genre's production for the majority of the film. There are multiple extended scenes devoted entirely to fictitious movie scenes that do little more than give DiCaprio's character more depth. This marks the third film in a row from Tarantino that is heavily concerned with the Western genre and his second consecutive, in my opinion, to have pacing problems.\nI enjoyed the drastic turn that the narrative took very much. I thought it was clever and a quality display of a classic Tarantino ending. The film switches to its second part at the distinct moment where the narrative of the past and the narrative of Rick Dalton meet. From here one out, almost all historicity is thrown out in favor a sort of retribution for the fact the American psyche has been so corrupted by the events that actually took place. The idea that I think he was trying to get at was that this was his version of a fairy tale. The film didn't feel like a typical Tarantino movie until the end and I feel as though this idea has something to do with that as is evidenced by the \"Once upon a time\" in the title.\nI didn't dislike the first part of the movie but after watching the rest of the film it's hard for me not to have any problems with it. It doesn't feel like much of it matters in the grand scheme of the whole movie even though it takes up most of it. There were also a few characters who I felt were detrimental to the film; namely Bruce Lee and the little girl, Trudi. That's nothing against the actors (you're welcome, Trudi) that portrayed them. I just don't think their characters (among a couple others) were written well.", "It's classic Quentin": "I love Tarantino. His writing is so engaging, its like watching a well choreographed John Wick action sequence. I also think Brad and Leo are two of the best actors of our time.The above needed to be said because I may be bias towards this movie. However, I had to watch this movie more than once to truly enjoy it. I didn't fully understand the movie the first time around. Lots of interconnecting stories and conversation that i thought had no purpose. So, when time came for it to end, I was a bit lost.My second viewing made me realize the point of the movie. It's life as a late 60's movie star who is at the point if his career that he doesn't want to be. Along for the ride is a good friend who just so happens to be his stunt man. What follows is a lot of interconnecting stories that move it along. It really is a story about old Hollywood. There are so many fun scenes that I found myself saying 'oh, i like this part' quite often. It made me realize how much more i liked the movie.The point is you need to appreciate Quentin's writing and the joy of watching the acting take place. I get lost in both Leo's and Brad's character. They have amazing chemistry when together, but their charm is also in full force during the scenes they are apart. There's a part where Leo is filming a scene for a TV show. Its so well done that at one point I forgot that I was watching Once upon a time... and instead watching a western. I get lost in so many moments, but isn't that what's special about Quentin.The ending confused me the first time around. I realize that the last 20 crazy minutes of the movie have a purpose. I won't ruin it. All I will say is what i've heard a lot over the years...it's all about who you know.", "Brad Pitt greatest on nostalgia that could take an hour less": "Just back from watching it. Production is great, the nostalgia of old places and cars and this and that. But after an hour I got wondering if that was it, the story of Pitt and DiCaprio's characters, and some of Sharon Tate's (is Tarantino making an homage and then building a fantasy about Mason not murdering her at all?) is thrown in a sort of small sketches between the global boring and lost pace. It's a good movie and Pitt is terrific though.", "Two hours of boredom, then it gets interesting": "For me it is the worst Tarantino movie I have ever seen.\nIt is well crafted, directed and thought out, I give props to that. But I felt like there was nothing happening at all, that it is just a movie for fans of nostalgia. I didn't get a connection with any of the characters, I didn't care for them at all. There were scenes that just went on forever with no point to them at all\nThe finale however is quite typically Tarantino, I was not disappointed with that. I would even say that the two hours of boredom before heightened the extreme violence happening there. So in that sense it might even have served a purpose to sit through this exhausting elongated torture.", "Huge let down": "As I seen more and more big name actors in this flick you just knew that there was going to be a great plot in the works especially with Quentin Tarantino directing. However, it was very slow building throughout the entire movie and every time there was a sporadic good scene and I thought \"alright, this is where it's going to get good and the story is going to start coming together\" the storyline went cold again and I was left wondering what the point of the story was and when it would manifest into anything of substance, but it never really did. I gave it 3 stars only because some scenes in the movie were actually good but they were only a handful of scenes and did not make up for how long and boring the rest of the movie was.", "A true auteur": "Quentin Tarantino is a genius. Once a upon a time in hollywood takes advantage of it's bankable and supremely talented actors. The chemistry between Leo and Brad, combination with Tarantino's intelligent writing and amazing camera work, makes it a unique and creative experience. The movie banks on it's extra ordinary star, especially brad, who is just amazing. The final act is one of the tarantino's best pay off ever filmed.", "Genius Tarantino.": "All films that were directed by Tarantino have own charms and special features. Thos film is not exception. Director wanted to show atmosphere of old Hollywood, the place where he grown. He was successful in it. All supporting characters has their own triats, they creates wonderful soul of that Hollywood. Main characters are amazing, Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt did feally wonderful performance. So, it's one the best film from genius Tarantino.", "Still waiting...": "If you want to spend 2.75 hours of nothingness, go see this. Scratching my head wondering what DiCaprio and Pitt were thinking doing such a terrible movie. And I usually love Teratino. UGH!", "An Ode to 1969": "I went in to watch Once Upon a Time in Hollywood thinking it was going to be Tarantino's ode to the movie about movies. After all, he's a past master at paying homage to the gangster film, the western, the martial arts flick, the nazi film, et al.But after watching it, I'm pretty much convinced it's his ode to 1969! Simply brilliant how he captures the era...the LA boulevards, the signboards, the Vietnam war, the hippies, acid tipped cigarettes, spaghetti westerns, Bruce Lee, the Manson cult, radio commercials, and yeah the music. Definitely the music.", "Not a comedy or drama": "This movie was too long. There were a few funny parts with Rick Dalton's character with his bad acting and sad career but it wasn't all that funny. It this was suppose to be a drama it failed. When the mason groupies recognize Dalton it wasn't funny and it wasn't drama. It was just awkward. Just weird. IMO Tarantino is way over rated.", "My Review from Cannes": "Once a Time in Hollywood, the new film from contemporary trend setter Quentin Tarantino is a masterful and lushly directed spectacle that may well be his best film since Pulp Fiction.The film tells the tale of Rick (Leonardo DiCaprio) an actor that currently appears in a TV show called Bounty Law, but his career is begging to decline, so his agent (Al Pacino) advises him to take a role in a Spaghetti Western. Meanwhile his stunt double, best friend and driver (Brad Pitt) spends much of the movie palling up to Rick and giving him advice. The pair live next to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate and the story eventually leads to various joint storylines, romance, drama, action, Charles Mansion and a finale to rival the audacity and awe of Inglorious Basterds.OUATIH is a beautifully photographed movie with exquisite and enchanting cinematography including a four-minute long stedi-cam shot that may just be an Oscar worthy moment of photographic exuberance. Tarrantino's script is Tarantino-esque and continues his theme of running retro significant references to the late sixties, witty dialogue, pop-culture, smart one-liners and complex movie references. Tarrantino however needs a new editor as some scenes are overlong and too sharply cut. This doesn't ruin the movie but it looks poor and does lessen it.As for the performances, I can tell you now that there will be certainly Oscar nods for Pitt and DiCaprio and the later's performance is in fact so good that it may we'll be his best so far in his career. Scorsese's insistence of working with DiCaprio ruined some of his movies that would have been better with another performer but this was only a benefit for Leo who has impressively grown as an actor. Here as Rick he brings the confidence of his turn in Wolf of Wall Street and the stature of his Shutter Island portrayal. Pitt, who is ageing well, gives a performance that is scene stealing. In OUATIH, it's almost like he is unaware of the camera and he has a natural rapport with it and never seems aware that he's playing a character. There are some other good turns including a incredibly impressive Bruce Lee take off by Mick Moh.OUATIH is one of the best (but not the best) film of 2019 and will be long remembered by Tarrantino fans.", "Wait for it, wait for it, wait, wait, wait...": "QT was off his game in this movie. Three big stars and let's just look at them playing these odd roles for 2 hours and 35 minutes. QT must have smoked a cigarette dipped in acid.", "I'm still not sure if I liked it": "Sure it had good stunt casting, as in the stars playing dead stars, but not a lot happened. Not much plot and what plot there was was rather convoluted. So I have to give it a 4 or 5 out of 10.", "For Film Lovers. Only, sorry.": "Ummmmm it was ok! Definitely, Tarantino pays homage to 60;70's era! I did not see the point of Margot's character(RiP Sharon Tate). No offense. When I first watched. But watching it again I went with a more open mind. I guess that's the point. The film has great acting and barely any plot. Tarantino in my opinion just wants to pay homage to that era. Sharon Tate is a part of the era. Which is why Margot's take on the star is relevant. The plot I guess is the era that the film is in. Which is why see timestamps throughout the film. Signifying progression. Leo's character has a plot. He's an actor heading towards the end of his career, but in the end, we see him get validation from his neighbors who notices that he's a legend. Brad has no plot really, he goes with the flow. So we get to just enjoy his character without any expectations really. Brad and Leo's dynamic is awesome. Really good acting. However, to get this film does require some sort of love of cinema. Sorry if that sounds pretentious. The plot again is pretty slow. But this allows you to appreciate the moving picture without any ties to anything really. Which is clever. But calling it Tarantino's best work is a reach. A lot of people who love this film like that, are in some way into the film. A great piece of work should be able to capture all! Whether you are into film or not. This is a film for cinema geeks", "The Cinematic Equivalent to Receiving a Bruce Lee Punch By Mike Moh": "In gorgeous 1969 Hollywood comes a Tarantino special-with a pitch like that what's not to like? Packaged in Tarantino's 9th film comes an ambitious effort that should've been greater than it was. It had strong performances, groovy tunes, and an incredible production value, yet the dialogue, though as witty and cunning as ever, failed to amount to much when the event reached its climax. It's a bit like thinking you got punched by Bruce Lee only to find out it was just Mike Moh.", "For shallow people seeking for nostalgia": "QT begun his carrier with a punch, but he finish it with a fart.\nThe only thing worth mentioning in this movie is the attention to details and Brad Pitt. Both as Brad Pitt and Cliff Booth. Maybe, this movie should be about Cliff instead. Other then that, it's just like going to a supermarket on a Sunday afternoon, expecting nothing to happen.The few laughs and the very few meaningful scenes are far, far away anything remotely close to a good movie. It's like a professional collage project.My friend, who brought this movie to my attention and even payed for the tickets to make me go with him, actually fell asleep. My other friend went to the toilette in the middle of it. Something a movie fanatic would never do.4/10 for couple laughs, some of the mood and Brad/Cliff", "A different Tarantino film to say the least": "Quentin Tarantino has gone on record to say that after his tenth film, he is going to stop making movies. Well, with nine films out, the most recent film from Tarantino (as of this review), is Once Upon a Time In... Hollywood, released in 2019. The film was written, directed, and produced by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill movies and Pulp Fiction), the film stars Leonardo DiCaprio (Inception and Titanic), Brad Pitt (Fight Club and Megamind), Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad and The Wolf of Wall Street), Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild and Speed Racer), Margaret Qualley (Kenzo World and Novitiate), Timothy Olyphant (Live Free or Die Hard and Justified), Austin Butler (Elvis and The Dead Don't Die), Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds and I Am Sam), Bruce Dern (Nebraska and The Hateful Eight), and Al Pacino (Scarface and Carlito's Way). The film was a huge financial success and a critical success as well. The film even managed to win two Oscars for Best Supporting Actor and Best Production Design.It is 1969 and times are getting tough for once popular television star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) as they try to move into the film business and find work there.Yeah, Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood is certainly a different Tarantino film to say the least. Tarantino makes his films as love letters to a genre or era of movies and this film is no different and the era is perfectly captured fairly well and very much deserves the Oscar for Best Production Design (which had some good competition that year). But what this film does that sets itself apart from Tarantino's other films is that this one is primarily plotless and is a character study. Even with whatever is unfolding, the film does not seem to have any tension at all. The film is a romp through Hollywood 1969. The characters themselves are very well written and the acting is phenomenal. Brad Pitt is the standout in this film for sure but everyone else does such a great job that I would be hard pressed to choose someone who did bad in this film. Tarantino once again makes a film that rewrites history which I don't have much of an opinion of in general. It seems to me that anyone could rewrite history in a film no matter the quality. I remember seeing Tarantino do this in Inglourious Basterds. In this film, the changing of history mainly revolves around Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie). Now, I vaguely knew about Sharon Tate before watching this film and I honestly was a bit oblivious to it all when watching this film all the way through. But, some quick Google searches and it made more sense to me in the end. The rewriting of the history was done in good taste. I initially had negatives while watching this film that Sharon Tate is non essential to the plot. But, the more I learn and familiarize myself with the tragic story of Sharon Tate, those negatives are negated and her purpose in the film does become fairly clear in the film (the movie theater scene is a good example). The film leans more into comedy, which is something that was always present in other Tarantino films but never has any of his films been primarily that and with that being said, the comedy is good and is sold extremely well by Pitt and DiCaprio. Tarantino is very well known for his phenomenal ability to write intriguing dialogue. I have to admit that this was probably the first time in any Tarantino film that I was not completely intrigued by the dialogue. I am no writer so I am not really qualified to try and further explain anything about writing, but it just seemed that the dialogue was just not as intriguing as seen before.Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood is not Tarantino's best by any means, but if you come to see the usual big ensemble cast present in Tarantino film's and want to see something a bit different than previously seen from him, then this film should very much suffice.", "Great... if you can look past the insulting, often disrespectful approach to the source material": "What a great idea!...right up until it wasn't. From the fever dream failings of Leo's character to the depiction of a late 60's Hollywood recreated down to the last detail, nothing feels out of place. Except the entire ending that the whole story hinges on creeps up and falls flat on its face. There's no realization, no revelation and absolutely no intention, aside from the fact that one COULD rewrite history in such a way as to disregard and disrespect those who died at the hands of such evil people.\nThose who live on are treated to Tarantino's childish, albeit impressively intricate, attempt at historical fiction taken to the most egregious of degrees. Never before have I seen someone trash so many for no reason other than to further their ego-maniacal domination of alternate history type storytelling. I guess going in I had expected that some care had gone in to keeping with the historical framework of the Polanski/Tate story line/murder and that whatever fictional groundwork would be built around those events leading up to and including those events. I had even worked out along the way how said events would impact the protagonist, what with all of his existential crisis and fits of self loathing building up.\nPerhaps that may have seemed too obvious a route to Mr. Tarantino, instead opting for a ludicrous 3rd act so over the top as to rival even his history twisting film Inglorious B*st*rds. At least in that film some care was given as to what led to those changes. Here, there are no subtle drops in the sea. No easing into what could have been. Where we should perhaps have seen character growth begin to form around these great changes, something for the audience to connect to, we simply find emptiness- a hollowed form as soulless as the imagined history that can never be.\nIf Tarantino was trying for a retribution message to those at fault, yeah we get it, they are terrible people. We don't need this film to tell us that. Did it possibly tarnish the reputations of others that had no business being caught up in a display of flashy Hollywood make-believe? Did it ride the back of high profile tragedies only to twist reality for its own benefit? Yes. Yes it did.", "Boring Margot": "Margot played a pointless part in the film, very boring to see the camera idolise her, Brad pit was good, Leonardo was good, just no real story line, all of a sudden lots of random killing, I get the film, just could of been so much better.", "After nearly 3 hours of watching it, I'm still waiting for the plot....": "IT'S THE WORST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST 10 YEARS!!! The plot is boring, it doesn't make think, it doesn't make you feel anything other than boredom. This lousy script made it into a movie just because tarantino is famous.", "The problem with an ensemble cast...": "The problem with an ensemble cast is you have give everyone sufficient screen time which is why they're so tediously long, and that is the real problem with this film.A movie that's spread out over 2.5 hours, it could've been a more satisfying 1 hr 20 but instead panders to the egos of its actors. The first hour could've been compressed into 5 minutes (literally).I almost turned it off after 45 minutes, as I did with the appalling boring The Irishman - but decided to stick with it, a decision that was rewarded by the last 30 minutes of the film which was a welcome exclamation mark to a very long sentence.Whilst the storyline doesn't appear until about half way through, there's some great camera work, amusing set-pieces, a fitting soundtrack and as others have stated it's an homage to the era.It's worth a watch, but be prepared for a long wait until the usual Tarantino goods are delivered.", "Totally Boring and Pointless": "I have been a Quentin fan since day 1. I have seen them all and this is by far the worst. If it was not one of his films I would have walked out.First it appears that Quentin believes the best part of Hollywood was the 1960's. Since he could not build a time machine he decide to make a movie about making movies in the 60's. So you are watching a movie about people making movies. You get to see Leo acting out several scenes pretending to be in a movie about pretending to be in a movie.Then you get to watch Sharon Tate go into a theater and watch herself in a movie. Wow..\nThese scenes remind me of the box office failure a couple years ago called Hail Caesar. I am sure there are a lot of true stories in the film that are inside jokes. Sorry, but I do not want to go to the USC Film School to figure out who they are actually making fun of.Music has always been a big part of Quentins films which is one of the reasons I like his work. But this one borders on ridiculous. I can not tell you how much time is spent filming people driving around listening to music. And it's not chase scenes - they are literally driving through the streets of LA - riveting.The last 10 minutes are classic Quentin. But I had to sit over 2 hours to get there. I think that last scene sticks with people because of the way we would have preferred history to have gone and most people forget how awful and just boring the rest of the film is.", "And Thus begins The Sad Downfall of Quentin Tarantino...": "The best way to describe this movie is - My girlfriend nagged me to go see it and then fell asleep 1/3rd of the way through.\nIt has no SNAP! It has no CRACKLE! It has no POP! It has Rumer Willis! Need I say more?\nI'm quite amused by all these reviewers claiming this is homage to the films of the 60's - Pure Horsepucky - No 60's film studio would have allowed this tedious two hour and forty one minute stinkbomb to leave the lot.\nMy mother could have done a better job editing.\nTarantino desperately needs a co-producer with the cojones to stand up and tell him - This is excrement.\nYes, Quentin, PLEASE take on a Disney STAR WARS sequel/prequel and we'll be done with you...", "Stupid director": "The audience will not get anything but bore in this damn movie even decaprio and Brad Pitt didn't make this movie a good one it's so stupid stupidest movie in the world.", "Margot Robbie scene is either the reason you loved this movie or hated it": "That scene is the reason I for the most part despise Tarantino. I get the Hollywood throw back, I get the shout out to the golden age and all but if that's your angle then just make a documentary. let's just talk straight watchability of the Sharron Tate scene... Tate wanders around for 20 mins smiling looking at signs, goes and watches her own movie smiling like an idiot. It developed no plot, no character, no story arch. I would have been more entertained watching Real footage of her going through a McDonald's drive through. It. Was. Utterly. Pointless. Then we get dragged through a bunch of actors acting in scenes while playing actors acting. Then a bunch of uninteresting hippy scenes that are clumsily connected to the last 30 mins that all of a sudden turns into a dog mauling, acid tripping, flame thrower killing.... Pitt, DiCaprio, Pacino (what was up with his cameo by the way? There was less time spent on his involvement and story arch than in the entire Tate watching her own movie scene) This movie was a criminal waste of talent. There could have been a story here but instead we were given Tarantino nonsense and a script that would have been cut from PBS programming got the nod because Tarantino's name was on it. How about some accountability? +3 for just the sheer quality of acting present but I am awarding zero points outside of that, I could have written a better story, I would say that about very few movies but this exposes how bad Tarantino can be IMO. 3/10. HORRIBLE.", "Another excellent outing from a true auteur...": "I loved this movie, and hope it gets nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. But...I don't think it's in my top three favorite Tarantino movies (which is a pretty high bar). The production design and art direction were perfect, as usual, as was the music and cinematography. But I thought the bromance between Rick and Cliff was underbaked and could have been explored more fruitfully. And not to give anything away, but it's much less violent than I was expecting and ends in a most cathartic manner. It's definitely worth seeing if you're a Tarantino fan, or just a fan of the laid-back sun-drenched California vibe of the late 60s, which is so lovingly and authentically rendered here.", "7": "It was like a normal movie. I was keep waiting for something interesting and special to happen because some people write comments that it's amazing movie. Well, sadly, I didn't see it in this way.

Margot Robbie was irrelevant (although acted well) due to her storyline and I found a lot of smaller characters with the same situation which made me come away thinking 'what was the point of them'...Overall though I would recommend watching as still a good film, just not great which is what I was hoping for!", "A truly magnificent piece of cinema": "I loved this film for about 100 reasons. I love that it's a classic western in many respects and still an innovative story. I love the pace and how we all just ease into the story. I love that it is all show and no tell. I love how QT is so joyous about his love for the movies and movie theatres and LA and the weight that the mythology of movies and old LA has for him. I love Brad Pitt in this movie and love got so much screen time and that he spoke so clearly. I actually enjoyed watching LDC for the first time in any film ever. I love how QT uses audio and sound so unexpectedly. I love how every single thread got tied up in the last half hour. I sincerely dislike the last flame-thrower scene but hey, that's me, and I know what I'm getting when I see a QT film.) I loved the dog. I loved Brad Pitt and the dog. I love Margot Robbie and the utterly unexpected ending.", "Tarantino doesn't disappoint; most absorbing movie in a long time and a great theater experience.": "I had developed a learned aversion to the theater, after feeling disappointed so many times - this movie reversed that for me. I was happy NOT to feel let down by a movie for once, and both me and my girlfriend really enjoyed this. We both were kids in this era, as was Tarantino, and he captures the look and feel of this era perfectly.1969 was ultimately, the beginning and the end of so many important things in American history, and to be a part of this era as it happened, was an amazing thing in so many ways. This movie draws you in, makes you a part of it, and takes you along for the ride in a big way!More than with many other movies I recommend to avoid spoilers for the ending that Tarantino so carefully kept under wraps. I won't add any either, and all i can say is, come to this movie with an open mind and there's a good chance you will really be drawn into this movie too!", "Good start, but gets worse and dumber": "This movie started out fine, but the plot is all over the place, and the ending was stupid. Brad Pitt was ok, but not Oscar worthy. DeCaprio was solid. Pretty good acting, but the movie got weirder and lower in quality.", "Not as good as people say.": "Not a really good movie. Also, it's long very long! I expected it to be an 8-star movie, but unfortunately it's not!", "Really Bad": "I know it's a Tarantino movie, but these ratings here are unreal. The film has no real storyline and is like an assortment of random scenes, up until the last 15 minutes.The worst movie i've seen this year, Tarantino or not", "Honestly very underwhelming even when i had no expectations from this movie": "4 stars are just because of cinimatography and the acting. No story no plot development was there even the violence scene came as a shocker to me like why? Why now? It was bit slow paced. Few characters who were developed were just poof never seen again what's their role in the story anyways. The movie kept going back to the neighbours story i was like ok\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb may be there is a relationship which would be crusial in the end. End result neighbour is a fan boy . Litrally everyone is fanboy you could have told it without telling the neighbours story as well.

It is the worst Tarantino movie ever I my opinion because it fails on the plot or story. It is unfinished or has no real direction. At the end it feels unfinished and ends up just being a failure.", "I guess I don't see the attraction": "I really don't understand why people claim this is a \"great\" movie. It's a movie. It isn't Unforgiven. Unforgiven was a great movie. This was an okay movie. Essentially a \"what-if\" about the Manson family if things had went slightly differently.Wow.Next they can do H.R. Puffnstuf, except if Dracula lived nearby and the candlestick knew Dracula's neighbor. But the candlestick also has a past, a dark, murderous past. When Dracula shows up to drink the neighbors blood the candlestick kills him.See, I just wrote their next script.", "\"Just Die Already\" - Elaine (Seinfeld)": "The perfect reaction is Elaine when she went to watch The English Patient lol.It's literally giving anyone a pile of money Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and telling them to make a movie....The story is so juvenile, with Charles Manson randomly thrown in.... 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio crying....Al Pacino cameo completely forgotten, just rubbish drivel....Literally it's a showcase of the actors skills where you can write dog barf and somehow still have them perform at such a high level.", "Beautifully crafted, but pointless violence mars a great film": "What can I say? Tarantino is so talented, has so much fun, yet his penchant for over-the-top revenge violence has, over his last several films, begun to feel like a serious crutch.I almost feel like his film is decades too late. And that this sort of violence glorification - regardless of the director's intentions, good nature, the fact Sharon is 'spared' etc etc - is now well past its prime, and spoils the otherwise clever, good spirited vibe. It is also completely predictable. Morally, never mind, we have long crossed the threshold of questioning a mainstream film on its propensity for hardcore violence, but that doesn't mean one has to enjoy it, or pay money for it.So, sadly, I really enjoyed \u00be of this film, and hated the rest.Still, this is probably Tarantino's best film since Inglorious Basterds, but none of his films past Kill Bill Vol 2 have been as good as before. Perhaps it is because his editor died tragically, that a certain restraint has been lost, but his films used to be a lot tighter - RD, Pulp and Jackie Brown are still masterful studies in cinematic restraint, without sacrificing an iota of entertainment value. His more recent outings have been sprawling, obsessed with themselves, intensely violent, and all seem to be following a formula which invariably ends in some kind of shocking comical massacre, which is still bookended by so much well crafted material that it genuinely shocks. This is not B-movie violence.There are some magnificent sequences in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, some hilarious moments, a really good buddy-movie set up, great actors and tight dialog throughout that doesn't ramble, but gets to the point. I appreciated all this. I just wish Tarantino would consider once, that maybe to be truly shocking, all he would need to do is pull the reins in.", "Only 2 stars because of acting and cinematography - would be 1 or less otherwise": "If this movie was to be reviewed based on its storyline, it would be a 1. I am shocked that 2 brilliant actors thought enough of this snoozefest to star in it. (Make that 3 if you count Al Pacino - he is still one of the greatest of our time). I have loved previous Tarantino films and this one was definitely the most boring, most painful and most annoying as far as time lost. Save your money.", "Probably the worst Tarantino offering ever": "I just watched it today at a top of the line cinema in Hong Kong. A wonderful cinema but an awful film.\nFor the first time in 20 years, I fell asleep during a movie. The last movie that I fell asleep in was called La Luna and was truly awful. This movie except for the last 10 minutes or so bored me to tears with utter tedium.\nBrad pit did perform very well and takes this movie from 1 star to 2 stars, and there were a few very nice cameo touches, however the overall boredom factor was off the charts.\nI do agree with some of the writers that if you like 60's retro you are more likely to like this movie, however I must say that the insertion of the various characters into historical old film was done very badly in terms of the production values, and so suspension of disbelief here wasn't really possible.\nI really enjoyed Django unchained which I felt was quite seminal, but this was nothing like that. There were some themes there that could have been pushed well, but the parallel side stories that meant almost nothing were utter tedium at best.\nThis film could have been a real gem if it had been tightened such that it lasted only 45 minutes in total, and the production values had been significantly improved, but as it stands the most interesting thing for me was recognising all the roads that I had driven on before and some of the retro stuff.", "bad movie....": "So bad...i know he's*(tarantino) style...but this movie was so bad...:(", "Great film I'f you know the true story": "Was a great film with a really interesting concept for someone who knows the true story of the Manson murders. I think if you didnt know you'd be wondering who Margot robbies random character was and why all you saw was her at the cinema and dancing around with no link to Brad Pitt or Leo's characters and you'd also miss the major point of the film where you're waiting for her to be killed but it never happens. If you didnt enjoy it - research manson murders and then rewatch.", "Might be one of the most tedious movies I've seen since \"HAIL CAESER\"": "Don't waste your time or $$$. It's a slow 2.5 hour death march. Boring from start to finish. I really would give this a \"0\" if allowed. Margot Robbie. Would have been nice to see her more. A hard pass...", "Tarantino makes a fairytale for elders.Brilliant!": "As the title of the movie implies it is a fairytale but instead of dragons,knights, witches and strange creatures it has actors, stuntmen,hippies,psychos and happens not in a magic land but in Hollywood of 1969.Brilliant and genius idea.", "No plot or story line whatsoever, dragged on": "This film dragged on and was quite boring, there was no plot or story line. I found it quite difficult to sit through and the ending was not worth the painfully long wait through nonsensical scenes which with the exception of a few of them with brad pit were not entertaining or pertinent to the subsequent nonexistent plot. I honestly found the ending quite disrespectful to the innocent lives of the people who were murdered in reality. Especially given the somewhat comedic twist on it, I just can't find something like that funny even re imagined given the heinousness of the crimes. Those were real people with freinds and family whom I'm sure are still affected to this day. So all in all the film was boring, dragged on, difficult to watch and I really didn't appreciate the ending.Maybe if they cut out an hour from this film and didn't try and make the ending comedic it would've been better.

Nothing comedic beyond that.The anticipation that the story would kick into gear grew and grew, but eventually that just led to expecting nothing. Absolutely nothing, was given in terms of enjoyment, thrill or drama...

A wonderful reminder of just how talented Leo and Brad are. Best parts for me was watching Jack trying to cope with the fact that his star is on the decline. Scene in trailer with him after messing up lines was perfection. Like several have commented my main complaint would be all of the time spent with Sharon Tate. It didn't add anything to the plot and would have been fine seeing a lot less of her-she was actually pretty annoying and one dimensional throughout. Loved the surprise ending. Was waiting for the cutaway to show what happened to Cliffs wife....pretty sure I can imagine it. Lol.", "This is one fairytale you can skip": "After 1 hour in the film, it came clear to me: Tarantino isn't the best in telling fairytales. The main characters (although played very well) are just.... well.... boring to watch. You just keep waiting and waiting for the climax of the movie. And although that is done with lots of action, humor and sentiment, it just can't carry the two hours of your life you spent watching the rest of the movie.\nSo this weird ode to westerns was disappointing for me and I'm sure I'll never watch it again.\nOn a side note... For the love of gods ... Stop making me look at feet.... I HATE feet.... And made A LOT of scenes just disgusting to watch.So if you got a foot fetish... This is the one for you....", "Pretentious Snoozefest": "A boring, overrated, overly slow burning film that does nothing for the average Tarantino fan, apart from the last 15 minutes.

It is indeed close enough to PULP FICTION with the only difference that pulp fiction was smart.PROS:\nHowever the Direction was INCREADIBLE and all the actors' performances were really good without question. That's all I gotta say!", "To those who say it has no plot...": "I will be fair and admit that upon first viewing, I found OUATIH to be boring. But, it is one of those movies that requires multiple viewings to truly appreciate.If you think there is no story or plot, I think you need to re-watch and pay attention....especially to the scenes in the restaurant with Al Pacino and the very last scene. These are not throwaway moments; they ARE the entire point of the movie.Hollywood actor Rick Dalton, who has chosen to stay relevant by starring in features that are beneath his star power, feels irrelevant. He finds bit parts in a variety of TV shows, but he lacks confidence and feels like a has-been. All the while, he is completely revered and respected by those in the know. He is just oblivious to who Rick Dalton is.Sharon Tate, on the cusp of a meteoric rise, is the darling of the paparazzi but is virtually unknown to people on the streets. She is dating the biggest and hottest director in town and lives next to Rick.The entire purpose of the movie is to arrive at the scene where the gates to Polanski's house open for Rick...literally the last scene of the movie. If you pay attention to almost all of the dialogue to and about Rick, you will realize the esteem that people have for him; he just doesn't see it himself.I would be remiss to omit Brad Pitt, Dalton's true and loyal friend Cliff, who lacks the privilege and prestige of the star but sees his friend for the star he is. Cliff is along for the ride, and in addition to driving Rick, he drives the movie. Pitt has never been better, and he gives a phenomenal performance.Those who think this is kitsch or cheese just weren't paying attention. Tarantino movies are not intended for lazy viewers, which I certainly was the first time I watched this masterpiece. Trust me when I tell you, go back and watch it again. And again. And again. It gets better every time.", "Very Entertaining Escape From Reality": "I felt good when I left the theatre which was helpful. Thankfully it was a fantasy. A realistic film would have been intolerable. It is remarkable that such a traumatic event was made into an entertaining comedy. But we must never forget that this story is just as ridiculous as a Batman movie. It is a little weird when you take a real historical event and turn it into a Batman movie except that you use real names and real events with some of the actual participants still living today.I don't know. Maybe being entertaining isn't enough. This is the first time I gave a negative review to a movie that I enjoyed. It is a paradox but something bothered me about this movie the more I thought about it.", "Disappointing and quite dull.": "Probably Tarantinos worst film. No plot to speak of. Long, meandering and needless scenes throughout. Worst of all it doesn't have any decent dialogue, which is the one thing that can usually be expected at least.", "A Treat": "I watched this because it is a Quentin Tarantino movie. My expectations were low because it is about Hollywood. To sum this up for me and what I think about this movie: it is a long time ago I watched a new movie with characters in it, and this is full of them. It is absolutely refreshing. Nowadays, you only get all the dribble with flat characters and the same stories in a different setting.The acting is superb. This movie is the best Tarantino movie I have seen, I do believe that he has surpassed himself with this.", "Tarantino made another classic": "This movie will divide the audiences, it's more of a calm movie but the ending is classic Tarantino madness,", "A bit too long": "I was exciting about this movie since I saw trailer for the first time... but...after ending, I was like , thats it? ... well..beside Brad Pitt excellent acting, it was just average movie...:-(", "Only felt about this movie Once before - wanted to walk out": "Love Leonardo, Pitt and Tarantino but wanted to walk out of the movie. Only felt this way about any movie Once before. Didn't get it at all.", "It depends on how much you already know...": "While this is not a movie every Tarantino fan will expect or like it is by no means a boring or bad movie. Especially if you know some serial killer/hollywood history, and thats where the problem lies. The movie by itself is masterfully crafted with moments that will keep building up your expectations to explore more angles and witness more things, but it fails to deliver for those that know nothing about what is going on or is about to happen.I happened to be in the group that knew, a friend of mine in the one that doesn't and actually fell asleep. So if you are reading this review, be warned and know what to expect.", "What the heck did I just watch?": "Absolutely nothing going on in this movie. Here I am trying to convince my wife that QT makes classic movies only to drag her to this? I volunteered to leave early, no regrets.", "Utterly mixed": "The good - The performances from the leads are fantastic. Human, relatable- Tarantino draws something special out of two, admittedly vastly experienced and accomplished, actors.\nThe bad - the Bruce Lee scene seems unnecessary and a cheap way to build another characters aura.\nMost disturbing though was the other creative licence taken with history. I had mixed feelings about it in inglorious bast*rds, but for this, when less people will know what really happened, again I'd just question how necessary it was. The suspense scenes would still have worked just as well without trading on it.\nOverall really enjoyed it but just felt like something very tasty that left an odd aftertaste.", "Sucks": "Sucks, too mad director and confusing story , no aim and no drama , the best was brad pitt", "Worse than you can even imagine": "I admit - I had pretty low expectations for this movie but even those were severely understated. This movie was just such a drag.... as everyone else has already stated the obvious - nothing actually happens in this movie. So many pointless, unnecessary scenes that go absolutely nowhere. The whole time I was thinking to myself \"All of this will make sense at the end... it just has to! No one would write 2.5 hrs of total horse crap with no storyline in it\" But I was wrong. Quentin did.", "A vivid, nostalgic look into Hollywood as seen from the eyes of the stars": "Firstly, I would like to start by mentioning that those that come into this film expecting to make comparisons to Tarantino's previous works may leave the cinema a little lost. This feels like Tarantino's docu-drama if there ever was one. As opposed to laying a solid, anticipatory story, 'Once Upon a Time' is a film which tells multiple mini-stories, giving the viewer a feel for a late 60s Hollywood and the changing landscape of film at the time.Set over a period of months in 1969, Di Caprio and Pitt play an actor on his last legs and his loyal stunt double as they aim to keep running on the fast-paced movie industry conveyer-belt.\nOver the course of a few months, Rick Dalton (Di Caprio) and Cliff Booth (Pitt) work a series of jobs that help them get by in the unforgiving Hollywood climate, or in the case of Dalton, aim to avoid 'unimportance'. Di Caprio's Dalton is emotionally stricken by his lack of leading man work and is a character who is a little too deeply connected to the top end of the film industry. This includes the alcoholism, the movie star bravado and even the accessory of a foreign wife that comes with life as a spaghetti-western A-lister.\nDi Caprio is great at playing the emotionally turbulent and sometimes confidence-lacking Dalton, but it is truly Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth that steals the show. Pitt's cool, macho-but-modest, dog-loving stunt-man will undoubtedly be looked at as one of the most memorable Tarantino characters of all time. Booth is the cool, calm and collected to Dalton's unsure, uneasy and uninspired and this is at the centre of Pitt and Di Caprio's phenomenal on-screen chemistry.\nA war-veteran turned stunt-man accused of killing his wife, Cliff Booth seems much more content with his life than his best friend Dalton does, despite the vast differences in their experiences and living conditions. Booth is not only Dalton's stuntman but his handyman, driver and overall caretaker and is aman who balances his pride and humility quite interestingly. Booth lives a simply life in his mobile home with his loyal dog Brandy but is red-blooded enough to pick a fight with Bruce Lee and end up losing his job over it.\nIt's this exact scene that sums up the film as a whole for me. 'Once Upon a Time' truly is a daydreamer's film. A nostalgic reverie of Hollywood's Golden Age, encapsulated perfectly by a topless Cliff Booth fixing an antennae on a roof in the Beverley Crest sun, thinking back fondly to getting fired for deservedly crushing Bruce Lee onto the side of his employer's car.\nMargo Robbie co-stars, bringing fun and innocence to the role of Sharon Tate, depicting the late actress' final months prior to her tragic murder (which we'll cover later). Robbie barely says a word in the first 2 acts of the film but shows us a rare glimpse of normality, an angle rarely shown of movie stars. In once scene she spends an afternoon alone at the cinema, watching her performance in 'The Wrecking Crew' in the most non-narcissistic way humanly possible. She watches the film with the other movie goers in complete awe of their reactions; feeling almost overwhelmed when they laugh and cheer and reminiscing on her choreography during the fight scenes. Robbie fantastically portrays all of this emotion without barely uttering a word.Aside from his trademark, unsurpassed style of screenplay, Tarantino's genius lies in bringing these stories and characters of fact and fiction together and blending them so simply and entertainingly. Although at times, Dalton's filmed scenes feel slow placed (probably because we know he is acting, ironically) the film's true power comes from something Tarantino brings to all his films: the ability to make simply conversations feel and sound so interesting. Cameos from Stevie McQueen (played by the surprisingly resemblant Damien Lewis) as well as Charles Manson himself also really add to the film's authentic feel.\nSimilar to the way 'Inglorious Basterds' flung historical accuracy out of the window in its 3rd act's insane Nazi massacre, 'Once Upon a Time' completely skips over the Manson murders and replaces it with the most thrilling part of the film where the Manson cult themselves are murdered in true Tarantino carnage. This arrives abruptly at a point where you (disappointedly) begin to think that this may be the least violent Tarantino flick since Jackie Brown. That's when it barges through the front door like an armed cult-member and all hell breaks lose. The scene is superbly directed but honestly, any home invasion involving the use of a can of dog food as a weapon and the unleashing of a flamethrower in a swimming pool is a must watch for any Tarantino fan. Because of these actions, the Manson murders are averted, and this is barely even touched on, creating an alternate reality where Tate isn't murdered; and all without non-informed movie goers even noticing. Well, then again, this is the same reality where Hitler was murdered in a cinema, I guess, so fair enough.8.5/10 - Beautiful. Makes me think back to a time and culture that i've never actually experienced but have only seen on the small and silver screen. Fav film of the year", "Couldn't get through it.": "While I loved the stars in it, I couldn't make it through even half the movie. Was bored out of my mind! There's only less than a handful of movies I couldn't finish watching in my whole life (and I watch A LOT of movies!), and this was one of them. Very disappointed!", "Tarantino's Worst.": "Everyone in the theatre wanted it to end. I almost fell asleep and nearly walked out numerous times. Except for the end, the first 130 minutes were just plotless, presumptuous high budget boredom.", "No point for a movie when there is no story": "Everything about this movie was just incredible, except for the story, and there is just no point of a movie if there is no story.", "Two hours forty one minutes of waiting for something to happen.": "Love Tarentino but it's not his best. Overlong, with tedious portions that dragged, especially the Lancer TV show scenes. Could have chopped about 45 minutes off.", "Not your typical Tarantino movie...": "I'm going to be blunt here, I usually enjoy Tarantino movies, but I honestly couldnt wait for this long one to end. I wanted to like it, I really did... but it was utterly boring, plotless and messy. If this movie didnt have Tarantino's name on it (and of course the great actors), it would be long forgotten already.", "A lot of hearth": "\"Once upon a time in...Hollywood\" is a strange movie in the sense that there isn't a clear plot but it's more like spending some time with these interesting characters and their lives. Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth played by DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are well characterised and I was so into what they were doing. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is instead a symbol: she symbolises the happy, thoughtless and hopeful pre Cielo Drive Hollywood. Tarantino is excellent as usual in writing dialogues that keeps you interested and engaged. Everyone expects an excellent technical department by Tarantino and this is the case, but one thing that I found more prominent here that in his other movies is the heart. During the watching I felt the passion and the love that the director put into this work and I really appreciated this aspect. Indeed I think that doing something you like as a job is a blessing and this can bring to a better quality of it. And this movie is a proof of it. During the film I laughed a lot, there were some emotional moments but the ending is something else: crazy, funny, violent, fantastic! With \"Once upon a time in...Hollywood\" Tarantino manages to revive the city and the atmosphere of his childhood but also a period that changed Hollywood, but all in a fairy-tale fashion. It's not for everyone because of its particular structure but I personally liked this movie a lot.", "The most satisfying climax of all time!": "As my title suggests, it really was the most satisfying climax I can ever recall seeing. Just fantastic, the ending made the whole trip worthwhile in a big way for me.\nTarantino has taken a well known history, (although no one can ever prove the whole true story), and turned it on its head.\nThis is another Tarantino film that I will be watching over and over again.\nBrad Pitt was incredible in his role, but Hell, the whole cast was fantastic. I truly dug every second of this film.", "What just happened": "That title was me at the end of this movie. The whole movie had what seemed like no plot and no narrative. The ending honestly made it I don't understand how people didn't like it. One of the most confusing movies I've seen in a while but honestly it was all worth it for the ending. One more great ending on Quentin Tarantino's list.", "Long pointless wait for a ridicilous violence scene": "Worst way I spent two and a half hours in a long time", "QT reimagines history and creates a Hollywood classic": "You know what you get with QT you get the unexpected. There are very few directors that can pull off a film this good. If you know about the horrors of Hollywood in August 1969 then do not be afraid. I will not give any plot points away as that is unfair to you the future viewer. Let this work of brilliance unfold and enjoy these Hollywood stars shine. This is about great directing, great writing and great acting in an era when too many people took LSD and smoked weed. Whereas QT's treatment is so brilliantly observed of a fading TV star. And the end is sublime and perfect QT fare!And why does this only get 9 stars, well it's 9 QT stars, if this was made by anyone else it would get 10! That's how good this film is. I will be gong to see it again on Sunday!", "At times a yawner but what an ending!": "Any two and a half hour plus movie has very likely some unnecessary footage. I'm going to estimate about 5% of the film was just Brad Pitt driving a car. Not being a woman, it got a little long.\nThe acting was great and there a few burst out loud laughs, but the highlight of the movie, it's saving grace, was the ending.\nIn classic Tarantino fashion it was a super high tense and insane situation yet it had a comical edge to it. And of course it came complete with the unique graphic violence we all luv and expect from him!\nAlthough entertaining overall it could have easily been a two hour movie.", "Tarantino is a genius, but this film missed the mark": "On paper this film ticked all the boxes. The first time Pitt and DiCaprio have been cast together, how would that work? Superb; when they did appear in scenes together. Which was not enough.\nI hate to say this, but I was bored and left wondering where was this going? Margot Robbie's storyline as Sharon Tate didn't flow with the film. Was she there just as eye candy?\nDirection, film photography, costume, fight scenes, great dialogue between Pitt and DiCaprio (when together) brilliant.\nWorth 2.40 hours? No. Could have cut down to 2 hours.", "How is this acceptable?": "Could someone please explain to me how it's acceptable to make a film about a true event and change the story?\nIf Tarantino's family or friends had been murdered so horrendously, I doubt he'd be so quick to trivialise and make fun of it. What a lazy and trite piece of work. I have been a long time fan but he's lost me now.", "45 minutes too long!": "Record it off TV. Once you learn the pattern, fast forward through all the boring stuff. I mean, watching a Cliff drive a car is fascinating but come on, enough is enough. The acting was great, but a good 45 minutes could be cut out and the audience wouldn't have known the difference, and story wouldn't have changed. Hard to believe all the 10 ratings. Seemed like Tarantino's ego just kept getting in the way of any real plot.", "Many long stories which lead to a small ending. Not worth watching. It's filmed differently, but that doesn't make it good.": "There are many different stories in this movie and even though it's quite interesting to watch the shown time period and the life of the actors, you get a feeling that there's a big buildup that leads to something big, but in reality it leads to a small ending (but at least there is a closure). But when the closure happens, you know all of the characters very well. Maybe that's the goal?This movie did have some interesting thoughts about acting, for example that certain roles don't lead anywhere and too many of them can be bad for your career.Anyways, if this wouldn't be a Tarantino movie, obviously no one would notice it and in reality it doesn't even feel like a Tarantino movie anyways (except the ending). I guess he tried something new and did a good and curious job, but it's not a reason to praise him.The longest movie I've watched in a while (2h 40 min).", "I didn't get it...": "I applaud this film as a piece of art, originality and filmmaking. Only Tarantino could have created this work, however I just didn't dig it.Once upon a time in Hollywood is about two fictional characters, Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth and how they find their way around 60s Hollywood. My first thoughts when the credits rolled was, where was the start middle or end. Random circumstances seemed to appear and then boom it's over, you forget it and move on. That's what made a lot of it pointless. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of 60s cinema and I get this is meant to be a nostalgic film. But I didn't feel any of it. For instance Steve McQueen wasn't used to the right effect of why we love him, anybody could have played that part. Particularly what frustrated me was the intrigue of dialogue, it just wasn't there for me, it didn't draw me into the story like other Tarantino films. In fact a lot of it was rather dull and pointless. However certain scenes were what redeemed the film. For instance Rick Dalton breaking his shell of mediocre acting and giving a damn good performance in front of the director, not only does the audience feel delighted for him but he does in him self and that was beautifully done by Dicaprio. Also the scene with Bruce lee which although he was used for comedic purposes it worked so well for the film. Certain scenes like that made the film, but then it went back to boring and fun then boring then fun. Which is why I felt it was a mix up of a film that didn't know what it was meant to be.This however makes me no less of a fan of Tarantino just because this certain film didn't click for me.", "The Ending and Brad Pitt save this from being a total disaster": "I'll start by saying I am a huge fan of Tarantino's previous films; all of which have fantastic dialogue and great over the top action scenes. This film had nearly none of that. The dialogue was bland, the plot never developed (because there really wasen't a plot), and frankly everyone except Pitt had a pretty forgettable character. Leo's lead Rick Dalton was surprisingly very unlikeable and the character himself did not really develop at all throughout the film. Margot Robbie had maybe 2 lines and no impact on the storyline whatsoever.It felt like I was waiting for some sort of plot line to develop the whole time, but instead I just got irrelevant scenes of Leo's character acting in a western flick 10x over. Really a disappointing, boring movie that seemed to drag on and never satisfy. It does NOT compare to any of the great Tarantino films of the past.", "A long way to go for a punchline": "A boring, meandering slog whose slight charms are due largely to the performances of the actors, and the fact that the movie was well shot. A lopsided, ill-conceived hagiography of late 60s Hollywood and possibly the dullest ever take on the Manson thing. There's a little fun to be had here, but not nearly enough for its runtime.", "Like eating salad you just want it to be done": "Turned it off 40 mins in - tried again and nearly turned it off again. Got through to the end. Painful.Seems to be no story, things start happening and you're just expected to know what's going on.No idea what's happening in many scenes.Perhaps your really need to know the story intimately before watching?I don't know what the first 2 hours was about - hung in there the second sitting.If it wasn't for the cast I would have been out.Bloody shocker mate.", "Enjoyable movie about a tarnished television actor and a stuntsman who strive to achieve fame and fortune in 60's Hollywood": "The 9th Film from Quentin Tarantino is set in Los Angeles 1969, Rick Dalton , a run-down television western actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff (Brad Pitt) , his best friend and stunt double , try to make their way in a Hollywood where the winds of change live.

Instead its a montage of hip, cool, retro images that are little more than curiosities. Its basically an overly long, borefest.The ending was exasperating. I wasted some time trying to make any sense of it. The Tate/La Bianca murders did happen and in the most brutal fashion. It was a cultural watershed moment, as some have said, it was the death knell of the 1960s. Why postulate that it didn't happen? I finally came to the conclusion that it is merely petty pedantry from the feeble mind of the once adequate Tarantino.", "Save yourself": "This movie was mind numbing.

If you aren't familiar with the Sharon Tate murder you will probably be bored though.", "Once upon a disappointment": "I'm not a movie critic but I know a good film when I see one, and this wasn't one. Tarantino narrates through a half hour of the movie. Pitt is likely the most overrated actor in film history, or at least in recent history. The picture is, dare I say, poorly put together, coming off almost like a series of skits that just don't flow together smoothly. And for a guy who's been known to write great dialogue, well that was missing here. Is what I say real? \"Real as a donut.\"\nNow, let's speak on why I didn't give this mess one star. Margot Robbie, DiCaprio, Margaret Qualley, and a couple others were really good, especially Robbie and Qualley. But all in all this movie is an absolute bust. Sorry.", "Longest movie that never gets to the point": "I was so bored and wasted almost 3 hours of my life.", "Portrait of an Era": "Quentin Tarantino is one of those few people who has managed to create a style of film so unique that his work is easily distinguished from other's. He claims that he will make 10 feature films in his life, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is #9 (he counts Kill Bill as one). What separates OUATIH from the others is that it is partially inspired by real events - the murder of actress Sharon Tate by members of Charles Manson's cult. This was a controversial move, putting a real case in an otherwise fictional story. But then again, it wouldn't be Tarantino if it didn't have a controversy surrounding it.It mostly follows two fictional characters - washed up actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo di Caprio), and his stuntman, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Dalton starred in a fictitious old western show called Bounty Law in the 50s and seeks to reinvigorate his career. Booth is a stuntman with a military background who frequently drinks. Both these characters are very strong, with excellent performances from both actors. Margot Robbie plays Tate and delivers a fantastic performance. While those three get the most attention, the movie is bolstered by an outstanding supporting cast, which includes Al Pacino, Zoe Bell, Timothy Olyphant, Dakota Fanning, Luke Perry in his final role, and many, many more.While the film is technically about Dalton and Booth, perhaps it's more about the time and place. The film feels like an ode to 1960s Los Angeles, basking in the style, imagery, and sounds of the time, also delivering a selection of songs from the time. A common criticism of the movie was that nothing much happens, that there's too little plot. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a story, it's a portrait of a time and place. The greatest strength of this film is quite possibly the way it transports the audiences to the streets of Hollywood. The lengths that they went to to bring this image of a bygone age to the big screen is incredible. Several Hollywood icons of the day appear in fictionalized versions, including Bruce Lee, Roman Polanski, and Steve McQueen. And, of course, it has that distinct Tarantino style that we know and love. The only distinct feature of Tarantino movies that's missing is the violence. This is his least violent movie by far.The film, like any good Tarantino movie, garnered quite a bit of controversy. The most controversial bits are the scene with Bruce Lee, which got the film banned in China (although that's not that hard to do), and the scene at the end with Sharon Tate. In regards to these things, the title of the film is worth considering: \"Once Upon a Time\" in Hollywood. Once upon a time, the opening words of fairy tales. Perhaps that's what this is. Hollywood's version of Hollywood's past. In that respect, you could call it a work of pulp fiction.Personal aside: out of sheer coincidence, I saw this movie in theaters on August 8, 2019, the 50th anniversary of the murders.", "Simply One Of QT's (and 2019's) Best": "Here the thing about Quentin Tarantino and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood - no matter what your opinion on him or his movies is, it's one of Tarantino's best, with a lot of heart and love for movie making, for building characters and relations. No 2 of his movies are the same, or even similar. This one is its own category. One just can't deny that QT is amazing at what he does. The movie needs to be watched at least 2-3 times, because one definitely doesn't pick up on every detail the first time around, despite its lengthy runtime, which is really not too long for a standard Tarantino movie. There's a lot of long takes, great dialogues, hilarious jokes and a grand payoff at the end. The movie gets better with each viewing and is 1 of 2 of my favorite movies of 2019. Maybe my favorite, because there's other director-auteurs, and then there's Tarantino, one of a kind.", "Save time & money, go watch smtg else.": "The movie was so boring that I was expecting a breakthrough at any time. But unfortunately I had to wait more than 2 hours before something interesting happened, and although the ending was fun it doesn't justify the 9 euros I had to pay in order to watch that pointless \"tribute to Hollywood\". Even though you are QT it doesn't mean you are allowed to torture people for 2+ hours with nonsense movies. Even though you get the best cast, it doesn't guarantee you'll make a great movie. It's time somebody stands up, raise their voice and cries out that \"The king isn't wearing anything at all!\"", "FEET feet FEET": "Close ups of feet pressed against windows, close ups of feet in the cinema, close ups of people's feet while walking.I'm assuming the rumours of Tarantino having a foot fetish are true.If that is the case, as with the a huge part of the movie, it's very self indulgent. Long sences of cars driving with music, which feel like music videos, which eventually add up and drag the movie out for no real reason. It feels overly long.On the up side, Pitt and Leo are fantastic and the last 15 minutes of the movie are brutal, hilarious and entertaining in equal measure, and pretty much save the movie from being a non-event.", "At first I was disappointed, but have watched again and changed my mind.": "I was expecting to love this film. I love Tarrintino, Brad Pitt and Leo. I've also always been fascinated with Charles Manson and his family, so expected to be enthralled. It was a tad long, but Brad and Leo do not disapoint. Im partial to Margot, but her character sadly was a complete flop. Poor Sharon should have had more substance! Tarrintino owed her that . The ending was the best bit! It was an awesome alternative.", "Pretty good!": "Overall I enjoyed it, though I was losing some interest during all of Leo's acting in the western section. The little girl on that show stole the show in that whole section for me. I loved all the Brad Pitt stuff in the movie though!", "Tarantino makes me feel think that violence is fine": "I was too excited to see that. Tarantino remains brilliant in the way he tells the story in his own way, even if it is inspired by real events. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are priceless, and I am still amazed at how I vibrate so much with the explosive violence that this film reserves at key moments. Funny, has a good editing and serves as a beautiful tribute.", "Opportunity lost in slowness.": "Awesome cast, excellent acting and I loved the Tarantino feel of the shooting. But there is no story. Sure, I get the irony. I get the hommage. But it's all over the place, and so long and too slow. And lacking any kind of real plot that would justify a film longer than half an hour. And then there were 15 minutes of pure crazy at the end. That felt like the sway in style in From Dusk till Dawn (but I always thought Robert Rodriquez was in charge of that piece of crazy).\nMaybe Tarantino was too close to it; I read he spent years on this. I can imagine a story that's being worked on for that long and changed so often to lose its focus and to end up with too many perspectives. The only thing that saddens me; you have an opportunity with Brad Pitt and Leo in one movie...I wish it had been better.", "Script lacking teeth!!": "Not sure what all of the great reviews are about?? The first 2 hours had a couple of good scenes with Brad Pitt facing off against Bruce Lee and dealing with a hippy farm. Other than those 2 scenes the movie was very flat until the climax - which was awesome, but not good enough to compensate for the rest of the movie. The cinematography was excellent along with the retro feel. I'm used to Tarantino creating more tension throughout the whole movie and it just wasn't there. I'm glad I watched in on my Regal unlimited pass \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u017d", "Not worth it!": "Alright, brad pitt, dicaprio, even al pacino is there. Yes, cinematography is great and we all know that tarantino is not in search of intellectual depths. Still there is nothing memorable in this movie-except changing sharon tate's miserable destiny. Not funny, not exciting, not adventurous, not smart. There are some substories but parts do not get together to make a meaningful film. If you are a tarantino fan in any case or desperately looking to get out of home spend some bucks and 3 hours. Otherwise do something elsePs: it seems that tarantino dislikes bruce lee", "basically foolish": "Some entertaining bits but a basically foolish film that lacks narrative integrity, historical accuracy and cinematic maturity. Tarantino needs to grow up and practice some restraint when it comes to needing to show off his minute knowledge of 60s/70s culture. I was left with an overwhelming feeling of WHO CARES?!!", "Bad choice 2 spend 2 hours": "I don't feel something after watching this movie. Decorations, actors, era's atmosphere are perfect, but I watch films to get emotions or mindfood: only 15 minutes before end give me emotions and story don't make me think about existence, so only 5/10 :(", "Do not watch this movie!": "Worst movie of my life.. wil never watch a Taratino movie again. Do not understand all these positive reactions!", "Crap": "What a boring, drawn-out, self-indulgent, misogynistic crap! The main character is a beautiful stunt double (Brad Pitt), who also happens to be pretty savvy. He effortlessly puts Bruce Lee in his place and saves the day, while tripping on acid... He also killed his wife and got away with it (hello Natalie Wood...). That's Tarantino's main guy... There are 2 types of women in this movie: pretty brainless starlet and deranged hippies. It seems that despite all of this abhorrent misogyny all the pretty starlets of today and their daughters are lining up to be in this crappy movie. Did Margot Robbie need this superficial role? It capitalizes and leads up to the tragedy that we all know and expect and just refuses to deliver. Instead we get this beautiful savvy stunt double get rid of all these hippies like the dirty cockroaches that they are. First off, stunt doubles are usually dumb and not much to look at. That's why they are stunt doubles! Nobody smart nor good-looking would choose that profession! Secondly, not only did the Manson hippies murder those pansies and poor pregnant Sharon Tate, but they murdered more people the next day. Also, Tex fathered 4 children, while in prison. But no, Tarantino didn't want to show us that... It was a terrible tragedy, the likes of which are hard to imagine and to turn it into this idiotic parody of what the world would be like if written by actors is insensitive and asinine.", "Tarantino is as Brave and Risky as Ever,": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a phenomenal film with a very well developed script and a sensational cast. It is both very Tarantino, while also being incredibly unique and standing on its own as an original piece of work, the film's focus on downtime and how often that happens in the entertainment industry sets up a series of very interesting events. Very little happens in terms of a plot for a large portion of this movie, but I was invested enough in the characters not to care, just enjoying seeing them develop.The movie can drag at certain points, as we can start to wonder as we're watching when something impactful is going to happen. Tarantino does get very indulgent here, and while it does serve him, at times as a modern audience we can get a bit frustrated.The cast is all around brilliant, the film gives a great showcase for Leonardo DiCaprio's versatility, playing the very layered and troubled Rick Dalton. Brad Pitt steals the show as Cliff Booth, an instantly likeable character who we route for throughout even when what he does is questionable, and Margot Robbie manages to own her role as Sharon Tate, playing the real life actress as an almost ghost like figure throughout, the film constantly builds to the real life event, and handles it in a way that is both controversial and, quite honestly, very entertaining.High octane laughs and suspense. Funny, thrilling, inspired and unique, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is everything you would want from a Tarantino movie, with a twist, I would recommend to all his fans, as well as anyone looking for a good comedy.\nA Hollywood actor starts to lose his appeal with the film industry of the 60s, finding himself having to change the course of his career, which has a knock on effect on his stuntman.\nBest Performance: Brad Pitt", "in another dimension, perhaps?": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood tells the story of fictional actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his fictional stunt double/friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Dalton is in the waning moments of his acting career. They live next to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha). This is a revisionist historical fiction movie that mixes real life characters like Polanski and Tate with the fictional Dalton and Booth, though Dalton and Booth can be considered characters based on real life people.Tate was brutally murdered by members of the Charles Manson gang, and they are also in this movie. However, instead of successfully murdering 8-1/2 month pregnant Tate and her friends, the gang of three were brutally killed by Booth and Dalton (and Booth's dog) after they decided to kill Dalton instead of Tate.So yes, the movie, in my mind, is Quentin Tarantino building a \"what if it happened this way\" kind of world instead of the tragic real life events that actually happened. I think this is why the deaths of the three Manson gang was so particularly brutal. Tarantino wanted to build a world where the three died painfully (one was burned by a flamethrower!). Then again, maybe Tarantino just wanted to have a bloody and violent scene. He does tend to do that...That said, the movie is also just fun to watch. Taking place in the late 60s, there's just that wonderful feel of the movie in that period. DiCaprio and Pitt are great together, Pitt's character is so bad-ass in so many scenes. Al Pacino has a scene where he plays producer Marvin Schwarz and is trying to get Dalton to go to Italy and star in some Spaghetti Westerns. He's not in the movie a lot, but he's fun to watch. Margot Robbie isn't in the movie that much, but sure does seem to capture Sharon Tate's essence and beauty. There's also a scene where Dalton has a conversation with a child actress Trudi Fraser (Julia Butters) and talks about a book he's reading while realizing it parallels his fading career.There are some great scenes in the movie. However, there's also that sense of \"where is this going\" feeling at the same time. That does make the movie seem to drag in parts. To me, it's a movie where I would say \"I liked this scene and that scene\" vs. \"I liked the movie\".7/10 for me.", "Tarantino's nostalgic tribute to Hollywood.. or his own career..": "I'm a big fan of Tarantino's films. So, I was excited to see his \"ninth film.\" This movie was clearly a work of craftsmanship. All the elements were there. The acting was absolutely on point. Leonardo DiCaprio gave us passion, development, remorse, and discovery. Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Margaret Qualley, and the rest were all pitch perfect. Cinematography, editing, sound, all masterfully dealt, as one would expect. The writing... well.. the dialog, was there. But, what about the story? A movie doesn't need a plot, but a good movie always has something to say. So what was this film trying to say? (Besides being an ad for the tobacco industry)\nThat's where this film started to diverge from his earlier work. There wasn't much gratuitous violence (until the end). While each scene was interesting to watch as a crafted slice-of-life biopic, without the over-the-top theatrics, it got, at 2h 41m, frankly a bit boring. I've seen people walk out of his films from shock value; I could see them walking out of this one for boredom. It did hew closely to his template as a historical what-if revenge. This time around, it was the Charles Manson murders. Unfortunately, I didn't know this going in and, not having lived through it, I wasn't versed in the details. So, unlike his previous forays into nazis, slavers, bounty hunters, etc., the context wasn't as universally familiar. I needed to find something else to resonate. It also feels at this point that the revenge-twist climax is Tarantino on writing auto-pilot. I think at heart, this was really just a nostalgia film.\nAlso unfortunately for me, I didn't live through and couldn't relate to Hollywood in the late 60s, nor do I have a desire for that brand of misogyny. Maybe I'm just too young to really appreciate this film? Sharon Tate's character was sweet and innocent and showed her potential; but it had thin writing and little development. Maybe that was the point. Margot has the chops, but the empowerment of Pam Grier or Uma Thurman was sorely missing as the male leads save the day for his shrieking and flailing real-life wife Daniela Pick.\nI suppose this flick gives a window into another time and place... But really, the best I garnered from it was that, on another level, it was actually a self-allegory. A nostalgia not just for Hollywood, but a tribute for Tarantino's own career and films (it was quite replete with insider references). How fitting that the main character was wrestling with fear of being washed up and past his prime. Is this some self-awareness of Tarantino's own insecurities? Unfortunately, I fear this movie makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy...", "Appalling Movie Writing": "Amazin perfomance by Leo, but with a plot that never really goes anywhere with a director desperately searching for a conclusion to a poor script wirh the only thing he knows...absolutely poibtless violence", "Missing": "The things I did miss the most was:\ntension, a good storyline and great dialogue.\nBefore the movie I thought that it couldn't be more worse than F&F (because that movie was really bad).

Brad and Leo are at their finest here and Brad just steals the cake ,in the Bruce lee scene and in the ending...God, what a shocking and gut splitting funny ending that was...Im not gonna say What , its just not the ending I thought was coming and it couldnt of been funnier or more tarantino...the whole movie transports you back in time to that 70's vibe....it has it and it takes you there...People who are taking offense to the ending or to bruce lee's scene need to remember that it IS a parody and the very title Does say \"once upon a time\"\nmeaning, the storyteller, tarantino, is gonna take liberties with how it plays out..he does it masterfully and its a blast with his Spin on hollywood...thumbs up!", "Brilliant, funny and very entertaining": "Am a big fan of Tarantino and this didn't let me down.\nAlso being a De Caprio and Pitt fan added the icing on the cake.\nThere were some very humorous scenes, with excellent acting and cinematography.\nA thoroughly well spent couple of hours.", "Nothing happened": "Nothing happened.So I owe no explanation, Mr Tarantino6/10", "Boring af!": "What a waste of time! Loved the actors but hated the movie i'm sorry!", "Indulgent at times but also brilliant": "I've read reports that before Hitchcock insisted audiences watched Psycho from the beginning it was normal for cinema audiences to walk into a theatre halfway through a film and still enjoy it. With Tarantino's latest I did get the impression that this film can be enjoyed by slipping in and out at various points without any real danger of losing too much of the plot. In that way as well as many others he has truly captured the golden age of Hollywood. The acting is superb, as you would expect with such heavyweight names attached, and it's refreshing to see so many new names hold their own against the veterans. The final act is pure Tarantino with his trademark ultra-violence and the ending is a beautiful surprise. Grab a big bag of popcorn, pick a comfy cinema with top-notch projection and sound and prepare to be taken on a beautiful and wonderful journey.", "Aware of itself": "The way I rate movies on IMDb movies (1-10) is the same way the United State's average educational system rates. 1 through 5 being an F, 6 a D, 7 a C, 8 a B, 9 an A-, and 10 an A+ (perfect).I never understood 1/10s for this film because for me that means the movie was actually garbage, meaning that the acting was terrible, there were choppy camera movements, illogical moments, etc. This movie isn't like that.I'd say this film is great for what is, but you have to acknowledge that it's not the greatest piece of film ever.\nIf you have low attention span, watch movies for entertainment without it having context, or are expecting a very derogatory film, think again. This film represents a small portion of the 1960s the way the director thought it felt like.\nThis is shown very well through the characters actions. The conservative \"toxic\" male masculinity shown in this film is unintentionally portrayed fantastically through all male characters. The film does this without actually calling it out. Therefore, you get a taste of the traditional roles men and women had during the 60s.\nThen you have Cliff Booth's character, a character that emits mysterious energy on him every time you see him on screen. The movie fills you with suspense in a great way because we don't ever really now his background, as we are only informed by rumors.The film acknowledges that the problems Rick Dalton has in his career are \"privileged white male problems\" without having to make that a very clear distinction (for example: movies or tv shows that intentionally try to persuade the audience that white people are bad). This is reminded constantly throughout the film, and it makes the story easier to focus on with that constraint out of the way.The director's representation of hippies is done well. Sure, it's not every person's representation of hippies during the 60s, but it doesn't deny the fact that there were people that really hated him. The hippies in this film are shown to take advantage of everything they see. This helps shape one of the clear messages of the movie: Value is being thrown in the gutters.Foreshadowing was done well. Acting, FANTASTIC. Production, FANTASTIC. Script, okay, Directing, FANTASTIC.You've definitely have seen better dialogue in Reservoir Dogs or Jackie Brown, but the dialogue in this film isn't BAD, it's just not BETTER or the same. This movie is more about one-liners while Quentin's previous films had taking-time-to-explain dialogue.There is one scene that drags for very long, and while its message is clear, it doesn't make it any better for the fact that it was dragged longer than it should have.It's also very hard to imagine you are watching 60s characters, since DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are very famous actors of the current world, but I'm sure that wont be a problem for the future generation.So many one-take shots that were a pleasure to see.Overall, this movie is great at telling you what is going on and what is going through the character's head without having to literally TELL you what is happening, and I feel like that is a problem for most viewers. They cant see the myriad of deeper meanings in films, and instead can only analyze on surface level stuff.For me, 9/10.\nFor sruface level viewers, 3 or 4/10I would recommend it to anybody who is ready to see a different type of film. And please, stop ruining IMDb by giving something you don't like a 1/10. That's childish. There is such things as opinions, but reasonable opinions.", "Sharon (Margot Robbie)": "Favorite scene with Sharon (Margot Robbie) -Going to the movie theater to see her film - The Wrecking Crew - and hear the audience reaction.", "Utter boredom": "One thing Tarantino is not: boring.

I didnt even watch till the end how boring it was. But music is cool.", "Very entertaining!!!": "First of all, I was not bored at all. I enjoyed DiCaprio and Pitt as always. I love movies that reflect circa the '60s. I enjoyed the pace of the film and had a great laugh throughout the whole movie. This film has allover Tarantino's signature. The recreation of Los Angeles of 1960's/cinematography, costuming, music are great, and the end of the film is good too. But also, it seems to me that all the thing about related to Sharon Tate at the end of the film it is too familiar. It feels that was copied from a film called \"The Haunting of Sharon Tate\" which personally I think was really good, but, critics and people trashed it! How come critics and people love Tarantino's film and trash the other one! Hmmm. It could have that was copied from that movie. Watch \"The Haunting of Sharon Tate\" and you will be agreed with me.\nAnyway, It is an interesting plot that resembles nothing at all but is Tarantino's film. Not everyone enjoys his films.

The movie is very well made. The attention to detail is amazing. The acting is great. I mean..you have Leo and Brad you can't really go wrong. Cliff Booth is a legend already to me. The movie does go on a little too long and you may ask yourself where are we going with all of this, but the conclusion kind of makes up for it. It doesn't give the movie a free pass, but its still pretty crazy, it makes it better. The Bruce Lee scene is well directed. It just....I don't know...its odd. It feels off.

Didn't realize he was the director and started watching, 30 mins into it and disappointed! Very low budget effect!", "Want to overwhelm yourself? Learn the real story!": "At this point I know that every movie of Quentin Tarantino will bring a well cooked excitement, most of the time out of the blue. I was totally ignorant to the origins of the film and mainly went to check it out because of a great director and incredible cast, but when my friend told me the truth behind the name and the story I jumped like a spring exclaiming all the know words of amazement.Yes, I agree that many people will find it slow, considering that we have over 4 minutes of Brad Pitt just driving around and stuff like that. But come on, if Brad Pitt just sat there in front of the camera, it would still be worth watching. Nevertheless, the movie is full of personal moments of the actors as characters not the actual cast, giving a look at their human side with all the worries and insecurities.Masterful camerawork and ingenious scene planning add tension to the moments where you are not expecting it. Some scenes seem controversial but while you are forming a complaint in your mind the plot moves on distracting you with something else.I think that a huge disclaimer should be hanging for all bypassers that are not familiar with Quentin Tarantino's work: the ending is always worth the wait. If I said that the movie is perfect, I would lie, but after watching it you feel the internal sense of completion, just as you would have after reading a nice tale.", "Mildly interesting.": "For me that was a boring movie with a very unexpected ending plot, i kept waiting for something important/interesting to happen but that just did not happened.I personally did not liked it, but i guess i just did not understood the purpose of the film.", "One big fail!": "I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino films. But this one is by far the worst of his series. Very boring, little action, way to long, no coherent story, no plot. Absolutely not particularly what you normally expect from his hand.

So, one big fat one star for this total failure!", "Long, stapled together scenes, abhorant bruce lee portrayal, worst film by Q": "The film clearly shows the talent of Quentin film making but is easily one of his worst films and for several reasons a waste of 3 hours and definitely not a rewatchable movie.To summarise... unnecessary long duration of 3 hours, scenes seem stapled or randonly forced toegther, script is not great and finally the whole bruce lee portrayal was abhorant and ugly...Quentin had portrayed Bruce Lee from the opinion of someone who disliked him.. what motivated quentin to do this is unclear but his justification for this action is just as ugly as the action itself.. i.e. that Bruce lee was boastful becuase he claimed he could beat Ali in a fight, when in fact no evidence or this exists and even if he did say it.. is this any justification to portray him in this light and contradict all the statements and footage we have of the man. Disguisting...", "Boring as hell": "By far the worst Tarantino movie and one of the most disappointing movies of all time.\nTechnically it's well made, nice costumes, nice scenery, nicely filmed etc, yes, it's a Tarantino movie, so they put a lot effort to make it look good.But:\n2,5 hours of pure boredom.\nThe finale of 10-15 minutes is funny and cool and violent and with a twist, it's a Tarantino movie I expect.\nOh and there is one funny Bruce Lee scene in the middle, but that's it.\nNo story, no plot and (most disappointing about a Tarantino movie) boring and pointless dialogues.\nLeos character is not likable.

Bruce Lee has been openly insulted. It was an American movie smelling racism.", "Awesome Fairy Tale!": "This movie reminds us what Tarantinoesque really means. The story is essentially about Rick Dalton, his stunt double Cliff Booth, and Hollywood. The length of the movie is appropriate to teleport us in the 60s as the director envisioned it. Performances were really solid and entertaining to say the least. The presence of Margot Robbie's character was angelic, and given the era the film talks about - it's impossible to not mention the hottest director of that time: Roman Polanski, his wife Charon Tate, and the whole hippie culture vibe!There is really nothing to analyse in this movie because it's intention is to serve the audience a cinematic experience in this most straightforward way possible. But, the way Tarantino plays us with Charles Mansion is worthy of an applause, if anything has to be put under a microscope: it has to be that thrilling aspect of a historically dreadful event.\nWatch out for the flame thrower scene!I am really excited to find out - what his tenth and final movie would be....!", "Three hours I'll never get back": "That was worse than I expected. If your going to make a pointless, plotless movie that's an homage to the late 60's Hollywood movies and TV, fine. Make that. But what was the point of the whole Manson stuff? It was just stupid and the ending was just dumb. As the title says, that's three hours I'll never get back.", "Tarantino is back": "What else would you expect but an instant classic from Quentin Tarantino?

All sorts if famous actors with a guest appearance of Lena Dunham. Spectacular.It's a lot like a coffee table book. You can flip through it and enjoy the pictures and the little blurbs of text, and most importantly use it as a conversation starter. Like \"I know that actress!\" Or \"I recognize that after but I can't remember what else he's in.\"It's a bad movie if you're disgusted by feet, it's a great movie if you like feet. I'm impartial so I'm going to give this a solid 6 out of 10. If there was more Lena Dunham easily give it more points.", "Missed the target.": "There doesn't seem to be a lot of middle ground with this movie, people generally think it's either good or bad. The story focus's on friends Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) a fading Hollywood star and Cliff Booth (Pitt) an aging stuntman, who careers are both transcending downwards as they move away from their prime years. The sets, cars, music and clothing give the movie a nice late 1960's nostalgic feel. The acting is average to good, but Brad Pitt steals the show with his portrayal of the aging stuntman. Pitt plays a cool character and is heavily involved in the best two or three scenes of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio seems limited in playing a kind of dull TV actor who is trying to keep his star power shinning in Hollywood. Margot Robbie is bouncy and happy as Sharon Tate, and Robbie does Tate justice I guess? DiCaprio and Pitt are a good pairing and do have some chemistry. However they are way off a great pairing such as Travolta and Jackson in Pulp Fiction, who made a discussion about hamburgers in Amsterdam seem incredibly interesting. There are a few scenes with celebrities of the era, some good and some not. I was a kid in the era the movie was set in, so I was familiar with the period, people and events in the film, however people born after say 1990 might not relate to the people and points in the movie? Unfortunately the movie is way too long, and the story doesn't always link up well and gets boring in parts. This movie needed to be about 30 minutes shorter to be a really good movie if edited properly.", "Over indulgent crap": "I went to see this with an open mind I mostly like his movies . But hell this was beyond bad zero plot . Made a laugh out of Bruce Lee for no reason. And what was that last five minutes about . That was up there with another Director Rob Zombie . Pure ultra violence as he forgot to put it in all the way in the movie . Go see something else . Anything is better than this .", "If You Love Turtles": "If you love turtles you'll love \"Once Upon a Time\". It takes forever to get going but it finishes strong. There's no shortage of star power lending their talent to Tarantino's twist on a time in the Hollywood Hills when real evil grabbed the headlines. As in \"Inglorious B's\", Tarantino takes a time in history that we wish went very differently and gives us an outcome that is so satisfying that we go home with a smile and a \"if only\" in our hearts. I'd still say Pulp Fiction is by far Tarantino's best work with Hateful Eight bringing up the rear. I'm going to go out on a limb and say Once Upon a Time is a distant second. If only you liked any character as much as you do Brad Pitts stuntman. It's not that the acting isn't great, it's just a script that falls flat as it rambles around for about an hour in the telling of the tale. Finally here comes the good stuff with about 45 mins left and the best stuff roars in with about 20 mins left. If this were a book you'd probably put it down after awhile and never pick it up again. But this film has Leonardo and Brad and you paid way to much to put this one down. It's for sure worth sitting through the mind dumbing first half in order to laugh and cheer at the end. It's a good night at the movies, enjoy.", "Why was this movie even made??": "Great acting by the cast, only positive thing I can write. But why did this movie even get made?? It's terrible! Did someone owe taxes? or a favour? or was it contractual with a production house? It's dull, plodding, no plot whatsoever, just a waste of time. But if you're a fan of the cast you'll probably enjoy their acting which was on point.", "Wow.": "I can not believe hope crap this movie is considering the people in it. I want the 2 1/2 hours of my life back.", "Grass growing": "Thank God I didn't pay to see this at a theater. It, in a word, sucked. Boring and what the heck did Pitt do to warrant an Oscar? Real snoozefest.", "A new favourite for me": "This is my favourite of all the Quentin Tarantino films, I loved everything about it... the storyline, the music, the clothes, the cars and the acting was just brilliant. It's a comedy/drama set in Los Angeles 1969. Leonardo Dicaprio plays a fading film star and Brad Pitt plays his stunt double-come-lackey both struggling in their careers at the tail end of the Hollywood's golden era. Without giving too much away, for me, because part of the storyline is loosely based on a true story, I thought it was a lovely, fitting tribute and actually quite sad.", "1969 Hollywood, Tarantinized": "Real and fictional characters populate actual and imagined situations in Quentin Tarantino's mind-blowing saga aptly titled Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. For older viewers, it's a nostalgic trip back in time while many references may be lost on those who are younger unless they are themselves well-versed with that period in movie and TV history. The main real person in the movie is Sharon Tate and while we all know her story, we still wait with bated breath to see Tarantino's take on what he would have liked to see happen. Brad Pitt's character Cliff Booth is given the best lines, and they are all delivered with immense charm. Pitt is in top form here, and he is the movie's brightest spark. Leo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is a more complicated role, a character riddled with self-doubts and who constantly needs reassuring, yet in his element at all other times. The movie is filled with interesting supporting parts, many of them played by veteran actors including several who had not been working for some time. This being a Tarantino movie, the viewer should not be expecting conventionality; the writer-director plays fast and loose with the facts and reality so much so that the phrase \"it's only a movie\" becomes almost an understatement. My advice to first-time viewers is to just sit back and enjoy the ride; there will be a lot to take in, so a second viewing may be helpful. As long as you watch with an open mind, you won't end up too disappointed.", "QT's least successful film, with maybe Jackie Brown as an exception.": "Parts of this film are utterly engaging-Dalton is a a great character and Leo's performance is a wonderful self-parody-but on the whole the film is not successful and it is at war with itself. The main issue is the story's tension largely derives from what the viewer knows about the (actual) Manson murders but because of a key re-write of history that knowledge is irrelevant to the narrative you are watching. Once the film ends you realize how much of it was a narrative slight of hand because key scenes of dread and threat are only that because of the actual history. But the film's narrative discards key aspects of that history for some cheap fantasy; worse Manson being a racist trying to start a race war with the murders is utterly ignored. Yeah sure I wish bad things didn't happen but it is such an idle desire and in this case a big bad thing, white supremacy, isn't even mentioned.Furthermore the film is overstuffed; there is a lot of period detail and character info that isn't needed for the narrative. On the first viewing it is OK because again you are expecting the actual history to play out but when it doesn't the scenes are made pure filler. A tighter narrative was needed.The film is up to QT's standards of visual detail. It feels like the late 60's and there is a lot of neat things to look at. QT still knows how the film violence that is gross, funny and intense. The cinematography is also quite soft on the eyes. But I must mention that QT's foot fetish is way to obvious in this film. You always know what an actress has on her feet and far too many the answer is nothing. This aspect is cringe inducing when coupled with the cheap fantasy of the ending. The implication about QT's feeling towards Tate is something I didn't need to have confirmed.But man the Dalton side of this film is just great.", "Expected more from QT": "This movie felt like i went on YouTube and watched 10 videos that are loosely related.Acting and scenery, which were amazing, kept it from being a total disaster.", "Elephant in the room ...missed opportunity for creating a masterpiece": "This film has a lot of plus points but also alot of flaws. It has elements that 10/10 and other elements that are 1/10.Two major flaws that produce 1/10 Is the the Bruce Lee scene..it didn't work and the theme of film should of been about belief systems. Jay Sebring should of been the cynosure of the film as he had connections with the church of satanism and introduced people like Sammy Davis Jr to it ( see Eddie Murphy reference to it in comedians in cars getting coffee)\nThe founder of the church had connections with Manson family members and is rumoured to had play the devil in Rosemary's Baby.The whole theme of satanism as a way of \"new thought\" seems to of been a flight of attraction to some entertainers as a way to manifest thoughts which would improve their careers, especially faded stars ..so this would of linked with the fictional Dalton Character who you see throughout the film trying different ways to reprogram himself into producing his best performances even by threatening to kill himself in the films best scene.This is why the Bruce Lee character was wasted as he had a different belief system it's well known that Lee was a great philosopher which he used in shows like Ironside.\n(To be fair to QT showed very briefly with installing a sense of gravitas from his peers before the fight). The irony is that the fictional Cliff character display the moments of zen instead of Lee who becomes a object for QT creative mixing that is also reserved for the ending.Watching the film I found this lack of mention of the connections to the occult to be a glaring omission of the beautiful visual display he had created ...almost willfully missed out.It's a shame because if he had been braver in connecting the dots it could of been a masterpiece\n...instead of just a good film.", "An exhilarating ride!": "This movie will not be liked by everyone . But the true lovers of cinema will surely be delighted by this movie. Almost every scene is a nostalgia filled joyride. Excellent performances all around .Shout out to DiCaprio and Pitt.\nThough this is not a typical Tarantino movie yet it stands out.", "What are people watching? Massively overrated!!": "Did I see a different film?\nIt is painfully drawn-out it took 150 minutes to get to the finale which was by far the best bit, Apart from a couple of Brad Pitt moments, it was dull and painful to watch.\nIt was disjointed and poorly written, no one in our group had any idea what was going on. I thought maybe we should have researched the subject matter (Charles Manson) a bit further as that was apparently what it was based on, however it wouldn't have helped as the film in no way reflected what actually happened.\nI could not recommend this film to anyone and it's neatly three hours of my life I will never got back.\nLuckily our tickets were free and we had a nice Italian meal which distracted from the film.\nI really don't understand the fantastic reviews people are posting.", "How the mighty have fallen": "I've been a Tarantinophile ever since reservoir dogs and I've been waiting for this one ever since i read its announcement.\nI went to see it and.....absolutely nothing happened. There is no sustainable plot.....or any kind of plot for that matter....or character development....or smart or interesting dialogue...or any meaningful attempt of acting, other than Leo's stutter.\nI wonder if the studios would give me 100mill dollars if i put a camera on the cockpit of my car and recorded someone driving me to work and back with nothing else really happening in the middle?!\nThe last 15min, funny as they are cannot redeem the previous 2,5 hours of nothingness!\nI just hope Tarantino's dry spell is only temporary and that we haven't seen the best of him yet..", "Odd Movie...": "It just shows the arrogance of Tarantino, don't take away that the film is jaw dropping, Stella performances from all the cast & incredibly well directed, but you get the feeling that Tarantino may have sat down with his buddies & said 'My next project, I'm going to troll the whole industry, I'm going to get a triple A cast, shoot the movie perfectly but here's the twist...the script is going to be so boring that people will still claim love it because it has me directing & Dicaprio acting...just watch these fools find a deeper meaning!'Well according to the average ratings...he pulled it off.", "One of Tarantinos best movies": "This is not much of a review.All I can say is watch it. Specially if you like late 60s stuff.\nThis is one of Tarantinos best movies in my opinion.My top 3 is:1. Pulp fiction\n2. Once upon a time in Hollywood\n3. Reservoir Dogs", "Utterly Disappointed!!!": "Being a huge Tarantino fan I must say this movie is nothing like his classics. The story is absolutely mediocre. The only thing going for the movie is Di Caprio. Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt and dozens of cameos are wasted. I was quite excited to see Pitt and Caprio sharing the screen for the first time with each other but this movie is really the pits (pun intended). What I don't understand how the critics and audience are still loving it?? Tarantino flavor kicks in only for the last 10 mins but in the end, the movie left a sour taste. I think tarantino wanted to play god. Make a bad movie and still get accolades for it. And he did! And he was God!!! Not anymore! It breaks my heart to say it.", "0 stars - i can't believe how bad this was": "So bad. There is no story, it just follows people around, and has one barely passable as interesting scene in the last 25m (when the hippies pull up one dark night on the street). I think the high rating comes from nostalgia of people reminiscing about the 60s.DiCaprio, TV show guy, made some movies. was upset he was over the hill.. got in a western production did one good scene, went to Italy, found a wife, came back, torched a girl who broke into his house, meets the next door neighbour. The end.Pitt, drives DiCaprio around, washed up stunt guy, meets a cute hippy, fixes an antenna, has a few flashbacks, drives the cute hippy girl home, goes to Italy and comes back to live in the guest house. some hippies break in and (the best part of the movie) him and the dog take care of them for the most part, but he gets stabbed and goes to hospital. the end.This is really bad, i could write about the other characters but it's all stupid, and a complete waste of time.", "Good but lacks some directorial finesse": "Unfortunately the fantastic on screen chemistry and comradeship between Brad Pit and Leonardo di Caprio has not been fully utilised by the director although its' pretty much obvious that the two get along well with each other and have enjoyed working together on this movie. A very good movie but not as slick as Tarantinos' previous ones.", "I get it...": "I understand why some viewers might find this boring and not at all QT's style. But I really thought it was very well executed. As Tarantino said, it is a Love letter to LA. The time period setting was outstanding and the 60's vibe was amazing. Brad Pitt's character was by far the most interesting and fun in the whole film, great acting and perfect chemistry between him and DiCaprio. It was a great story with fun comedic scenes and characters. I recommend watching it.If you manage to get through the whole movie, the last 15 minutes won't disappoint at all, there's a very good action/violent Tarantino scene that we all know and love.Also, I loved the fact that he mixed historical facts and real people with fictional characters and events. The one thing that kept me waiting was the ending, if you know the real story you'll know what I'm talking about.", "Only worth watching for the end": "I was sitting through this movie wondering what it was all leading up to. There was no need for it to be so long. The last 15/20 minutes were absolutely hilarious.", "Once Upon a Time Movies had Plots !!": "I absolutely agree with the honest reviews regarding lack of story and character development and had their been a plot then this would be worthy of a 9-10 rating and most certainly Tarantino's Best work to date however instead we get a series of stand alone film clips secondary to a visual journey of all the Hollywood Vintage Landmarks successfully capturing the time period with integrity\nThe Acting was top notch and set design was at its best however this fell short of what could of been an awesome story piggy backing off the cinematography and certainly not comparable to Pulp fiction for its intertwining plots which this could of desperately used to become a Gem !!\nDiCaprio and Pitt (Redford and Newman)\nneed i say more ?? hopefully Tarantino is not serious about retiring because i truly believe his best is yet to come !!", "OH PLEASE.....endless with a great soundtrack": "The cinematography, \"pretty faces\", cameo famous actors and costumes were great. The soundtrack was fabulous if you are old enough to have lived through 60s & 70s music. And the last 15 mins are a good tying together of all the loose plot lines. Otherwise watching corn grow is more interesting.On top of all that, the movie seemed like it was funded by the tobacco industry, with an overuse of cigarettes --at least one every ten mins. Reminded me of growing up with the ever-attractive Marlboro Man. And then a real kicker at the end that was tongue & cheek of a tobacco ad that was supposed to show....what exactly?\nWhat about social responsibility?!! Sure the cigarette smoking during the movie was true to that time period, however the additional \"promotion\" during the movie credits was a great opportunity to change the narrative. Instead of saying, \"These cigarettes taste like #$%,\" DiCaprio could have said, \"These cigarettes taste so bad for sure they are going to make me really sick.\" or some such. Or better yet, find another product!", "Not his worst...": "This film is a slow burn. The actors are fantastic and the cinematography is great. The story does not move at a normal Tarantino pace as it endeavors to build up characters. There really isn't what I would consider classic Tarantino dialogue. I'm sure some will disagree; just my opinion. The climax is quick and well worth the wait.I think of this as a \"what if\" movie that shows the Manson family as the worthless people they were rather than this mythical entity the media made them out to be. It's nice to see such a portrayal. For too long, that loser Manson and his loser friends have had a spot in the collective consciousness as evil incarnate.This is not Tarantino's best but it's definitely not his worst.", "I just looked at it": "It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It was just...there. Save for the fictional destruction of the Manson family members at the end of the film, It was about as interesting as watching office workers talk about envelopes and pens.", "So Much Lost Potential": "To be clear, this wasn't a bad movie. If another writer/director had made it, I would consider it pretty good. But when it comes to Tarantino, I expected WAY more. Over two hours of wandering dialogue and DiCaprio cowboy scenes build up to a climax that was just ok, and way too quick at that. Most Tarantino movies make me want to immediately watch it again...this one unfortunately did not.", "2h20 mildly interesting then what an ending!!!": "The most part of this film I'd describe as mildly interesting, nothing much happens you just get to know the characters. However the last 20 minutes is completely bonkers in a way only Tarantino can do - I loved it!!", "Rambling self-indulgence from a juvenile director": "Here we go again, Tarantino rewriting history because, well, he got away with it in his silly reimagining of WWII in Goriest Barsterds, so why not do it again with this pointless retelling of the Manson murders. Mercifully, fewer people get slaughtered this time, but it's the same revenge theme glorifying violence - pick the most evil people you can find like Nazis, slavers, or in this case hippy cult killers so audiences will cheer their murders.This time the bad guys are mainly girls, the evil Manson women, with Charles Manson making only a brief appearance. I've read that this is a dig at the MeToo movement, in which case Tarantino should keep his misogynist musings to himself, and you'll understand why when you see the ludicrous, sick ending. Tarantino has always had difficulty portraying women, who are mostly evil or dumb in this movie, but then this is a macho buddy pic, highlighting 1960s cliches and Hollywood buddy love between Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, who is so macho he gets to beat up Bruce Lee, for what reason other than dragging down the memory of a screen icon, I don't know.Apart from the ludicrous ending (the scene with the flamethrower was so juvenile as to be unintentionally hilarious) we are treated to plenty of drawnout scenes that go nowhere. Like the filming of a TV western, as long as an actual TV episode, or the Spahn Ranch scene that takes forever to build tension only to fizzle out to nothing. It seems to have been included only to give Bruce Dern a cameo, like the Steve McQueen (Damien Lewis) cameo, which is poorly backlit to aid the illusion and serves no other purpose than to deliver a clumsy plot explanation. Then there's long scenes of Pitt driving around LA to music just so more songs could be included on the lackluster 1960s soundtrack (seriously, couldn't they afford better songs?) or to drive past 60s movie posters on every street corner.Is all this labored film-nerdom referencing the 1960s and Tarantino's own movies supposed to be clever? There's no doubt Tarantino can direct and create scenes from other movies/ genres, and spin them into appealing floss, but it's sugary empty macho floss that will rot your brain with gratuitous violence. I can see how this movie appeals to old film critics who get the film references and remember the 1960s, but this movie needed severe editing and a coherent script.", "I wish I could give negative 100": "Are your freaking kidding me . It's a jokeThe entire cast a crew need medical attention for you . Do some mental evaluation pls go to a psychiatrist and do some sittingsIn which god darn universe did u think this was gonna be a good movie .Torantino shoot ur self", "Major disappointment": "I'm starting to think Pulp Fiction is the exception, not the rule when it comes to Tarantino. It was a happy accident. The \"genius\" director this time managed to make a movie in which nothing happens, and I don't mean nothing interesting to me, I mean nothing. At all.We see nothing but nice postcards from 60's Hollywood for about 2 and a half hours, Tarantino makes sure we see all the little details on 60's product packaging, we hear authentic radio broadcasts, and at the beginning you think all these little details are so you get immersed in the atmosphere and the ball will get rolling eventually, but the joke's on you, it never does.After 2 and a half hours of massive boredom and frustration, after seeing all the 60's food cans from all angles, there's a 5 minute random gruesome scene at the very end just for the heck of it, and the movie is finally over. There's no escalation or anything so it's weird, but at least it's mildly interesting.Tarantino also feels too self-confident with his directing style, overusing some editing techniques that don't belong to a slow movie like this at all, he uses flashbacks that ultimately make no sense because they don't give you any additional information, and not to mention camera angles that get very old and annoying very quickly, like when the protagonists are in a car.As for the acting, I can't really say anything about it. Since there's no story at all, there's not a lot to act. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio pull off a slight accent, that's it. Am I supposed to be impressed by this?What a waste of time.", "Boring.": "No idea why this has been so highly rated. Dreadfully slow and an hour too long. Only went as a friend is a fan.", "Plot?": "I would like to start off saying, first and foremost, this movie is visually stunning. Everything looks just like it would've looked from the time period, and everything... from the people, the places, the clothing, the cars... all comes across convincing. This is an aspect of the film I am not going to complain about, in fact, this aspect of the movie was incredible.The reason I rate the movie a 4/10 is due to the lackluster, and even at times, seemingly missing plot. Sure, you get to follow a TV Stars' life of smoking cigarettes and drinking, but in reality, that's really all there is to the movie. Really, as a viewer, I couldn't see the movie going anywhere, and as a result, it felt drag on aimlessly.I watch a movie for a plot. Action scenes and comedy are fun to an extent, but without a concrete plot, all endeavors to spice up the film through cool scenes almost seem in vain.So, stunning movie, great plot. Will I watch again? Likely. Do I agree with the critic and viewer acclimation? I do not. The hype of this movie being the \"New Tarantino Film\" has definitely created a large shroud of bias due to the diehard Tarantino fans making this movie out to be something bigger than it is. I personally have no bias because I haven't seen almost any of his other films.", "The Tarantino Effect": "Somehow, after 200+ movie review podcasts and a few dozen of these written critiques (so far), yours truly has not reviewed a Quentin Tarantino motion picture. This might have been tactical. I feel like I'm ready now. Let's start at the end and work our way backwards...The 9th feature from Q.T. is certainly the most fun film he's made in awhile, if not ever. He saves ALL the violence for the finale and that tension release really pays off. He's fond of calling this movie a 'hang out' movie, as in: it's really just about 'hanging out' with these characters. That's all well and good but mostly lip service, low key advertising.I am a fan of Tarantino and have seen all of his movies during their theatrical release (starting with Pulp Fiction). My main criticism has always been that they don't age well; they age horrifically. In fact, I'd argue they spoil as soon as you remove from the shelf (the shelf in this metaphor is the movie theatre; following?). I call this The Tarantino Effect; it's not easy to explain but I'll try.I recently sat down to re-watch Pulp and The Hateful Eight, as both films have been added to the popular streaming service, Netflix+. I was shocked by how little they resonated, how stifled the dialogue felt. I NEVER feel this way seeing his movies on the big screen, mind you. How odd? It felt like Tarantino having an inane conversation with himself through the arbitrary characters most of the time. This is all a very long-winded way of saying: I'm not sure how much this matters when giving a film a mostly arbitrary score or writing a review. It's OK to watch a movie a single time and never revisit it. In that way, they remain timeless and, hopefully, good (in your mind's eye).Or, counterpoint: longevity and rewatchability matters, perhaps greatly. So let's split the difference (at least as it pertains to the Tarantino-Verse). Hollywood feels like a low to solid 9 outta 10. This is its movie theatre grade and perhaps its forever grade as well. Of course it is. It's a fantastic movie! It hits all the beats you're looking for in a cinema experience and never tires even as it approaches three hours in length. I won't belabor this point. You should have seen this at your cineplex when you had the chance and I'm sorry if you didn't. The End.Will it hold up? Who's to say. I will get around to rewatching all of Q.T.'s films at some point and assess them on a different scale: the forever grade. Our culture might seem to demand that this be the more important grade. But what I'm saying to you now, dear reader is: please reject my hypothesis; I needn't be further indulged anyway.", "Best one yet!": "I'd really recommend watching this film! The best Tarantino movie I've seen! Of course their is lots of funny scenes and lots of action going on! 9/10", "What was that garbage?": "What was that absolute rubbish? The movie just plodded along as if it was building to an all too familiar Tarantino ending. Instead what was served up was some over the top, meaninglessly violent ending that made absolutely no sense to anyone.", "pathetic": "Just one word pathetic. no reason anyone shud watch this movie. for reference i did like hateful 8, pulpfiction, inglorius basterds, jango,kil bill, reservoir dogs", "Sublime": "The film travels you to the late 60s era in a unique way. The \"tarantining\" last 30 minutes will recompess you even if you find the first hours boring", "Good acting, mediocre movie": "I'm not sure why this movie got so much praise during awards season. It's a pretty mediocre movie. The acting from Pitt and DiCaprio is good but the story is weak and pretty boring. Margot Robbie is pretty forgettable as Sharon Tate, basically all she does is smile & dance in basically all of her scenes. DiCaprio plays the part of an actor realizing he's on the downside of his career well. Brad Pitt plays the calm & cool stunt double well. Not sure though how this was the role that got him an award compared to some of the other better movies he's been in.Basically this movie feels like it got such a positive reception because it's Hollywood stroking Hollywood. It's not a terrible movie, DiCaprio & Pitt have good chemistry together. But the story is pretty weak and the movie kind of drags on.", "It has to be more": "It has to be more than a fairy tale. It has to be more than an homage to Hollywood Gone By. It has to be more than filled with beautiful shots that take us back to days gone by. All this was there excellently, but without human beings and a human story (or stories) to draw us in and make us care, it all ends up just so . . . . cold. Until we get to the ratched-up ending which, although it certainly makes us sit up and take notice, I don't know to what end. Yeah, I wish that final episode had turned out your way too in August of 1969. But so what? It didn't. The switchup may be cathartic for Tarantino 50 years later (like the scalping in that other one), but it wasn't for me. Just didn't make me care about anybody or anything in this movie. And that's my era.Well, maybe the clips from the old TV shows got to me a little.", "POINTLESS... Watch it in ffwd mode": "If you have to watch this movie, do it in ffwd mode and save your self some time to see some other, for example french movie that won't let you feeling dumb.", "Certainly good, but it was missing something...": "Probably like 68/100Don't get me wrong, this is certainly a good movie, and one that is unlike anything that comes out these days, which already gives it a ton of points do to originality in my book, but it is missing something...and that in my opinion is the thing that makes Tarantino movies, well, Tarantino. I don't know what it was, but it wasn't as good as his other films. In fact, I think it's one of his worst. The dialogue just doesn't seem as compelling as it is in his other films and it's a bit choppy, even for a Tarantino movie, which is kind of his style. But, I don't know, this movie just left me wanting more. Don't get me wrong; the acting, cinematography, production design, and atmosphere are all excellent, but it's missing the mystique of a Tarantino film. It's characters aren't as compelling, in my opinion. This is definitely a good movie, but I just don't think it's REALLY good, or great. I am definitely going to give it a second watch, though, so this rating may go up.", "Do you know old movies or Hollywood": "If you don't know 1950's old Hollywood movies and acting of that time then don't go there. Ask anyone what is the story no one will be able to tell because there is no story. All the movie except last 10 min is very slow and very boring.", "Once Upon A Time... In Tarantino's Mind": "It took me for awhile thinking how much stars does this film deserve. Believe me or not, it wasn't easy at all, for me. This is the most difficult dilemma I have encountered so far. Let's talk a bit.After the movie ended, I noticed arguments that this movie was not something. In fact, there were a bunch of Tarantino fans who \"didn't fly\" on it, in Israeli slang. They said and I quote: \"90% of the movie was garbage except the ending which was lit.\" I wouldn't be surprised by that, to be honest. I understand why many people complain about this film. However, to me it just worked.There is something great about film that worked very well and swept most of the audience (despite the problems I recognized, which I'll be discussing this later). I will nonetheless try to explain what makes it a fun experience alongside its drawbacks.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS LITTLE SPOILERS !Let's start with the name of the film in Hebrew (surprise, I'm from Israel \u00f0\u0178\u2021\u00ae\u00f0\u0178\u2021\u00b1) not \"There were times in Hollywood\", but \"Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood\", which is a fairly-tale film and not nostalgic in itself. I don't think it will be surprising to Tarantino fans, but it still needs to be emphasized that this is Tarantino's most understated and at the same time relaxed film since the wonderful Jackie Brown, as far as Tarantino is capable of restraint, that allows the viewers to soak in the setting the film is in.The story sets in Hollywood 1969, where a TV star, Rick Dalton (Leo), who his stage of transition to cinema was unsuccessful and he is in the crisis of his career. Throughout the film, his stunt accompanies, Cliff Booth (Pitt), who in this case is the best friend to make all his arrangements. Rick lives in a house close to one of Hollywood's hottest and famous couples - director Roman Polanski (Zawierucha) and his wife, actress Sharon Tate (Robbie). Rick belongs to Hollywood's past, and dreams of starring in Plonsky's films.It appears Tarantino have arrived with love and compassion for this film. He loves his characters, he loves the atmosphere of Hollywood in 1969 (during his adolescence). In fact, Tarantino created a love letter to Hollywood at a time when he was growing up and the result was that he was able to drag the audience into Tarantino's personal and exciting experience of his. In the end, the story that he tells is made up of a combination of storytellings that he has told to these days, and the conclusion is that he created something new and different, that feels like he made his new film, but more innovative and upgraded.From this it can be said that most viewers expect as much violence as in his previous films. guess what? It won't happen this time. It seems that Tarantino overcame the violence between whoever uses violence in the work also carries responsibility for how the audience responds. Does it make the movie better than its other films because of the violence? I have no clue.The film puts us in the main character, Rick Dalton. He fails to fit into the 1960s cinema, he would love for his past to return but he knows it will never happen. Just as Tarantino used to cast past stars in his films, so now Rick is cast as a guest character in series and spaghetti westerns, in this case. And as it didn't change the life of those who cast in Tarantino's films, so it doesn't really change their life (and Rick's in that case, too). Take an example of Michael Madsen who used to play lots of Tarantino's films in the past when he was famous, during this time he is less acting and so you can see his cameo character in this film which was of no use to the content.Leo and Brad doing such a good and hilarious performances, where they both represent doubles of each other in real life, though Rick Dalton is angry and frustrated due of his career fallings (and hippies) while his best bud Cliff Booth is perfectly happy to be his bud's handyman. Leo gives a great acting when he plays a bad cowboy in western spaghetti series and doesn't recall enough lines for his role. There is a tremendous scene between Leo/Rick and little girl playing alongside him, where he reads his \"Easy Breezy\" book and understands things about himself. It's a very bare scene and he is just wonderful in it. Brad's performance is perfect where he represents the power of stunt-double in cinema industry. Cliff Booth has a dark past and a likeness to a violent Tarantino character - he is also a charmer. There is a great long sequence that begins with a ride for a young girl and ends up on a farm where he once worked as a movie stuntman, and nowadays serves as the \"Manson family\" which they pose a threat to him, and he is simply excellent at it.Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate gives a small performance, and yet an important one. There is a marvelous sequence where she reached to the theater to watch a new film where she stars in it (it appeared in official trailer, too). She isn't famous enough to get recognized, but it obvious she's on her way there. She enters the hall to watch the film starring her and there she sticks to the audience's delight. Therefore, her role is a symbol because she symbolizes the future and her hope, she is beautiful in purity and kindness.\nPacino (as Mr. Schwarz) had a small role, and almost didn't contribute to the content. But, at least I'm glad he was involved in it.This film filled with Easter eggs, references, cameos, and all other manner like Tarantino does it in his every picture, which I won't spoil anything (except I gave a cameo by Michael Maddsen as an example).Now the part where I complain about multiple differences from other Tarantino's previous pictures. I felt the dialogues were the cluttered case in the movie and that is why the film became so different from all of Tarantino's films. Want to see I'm right? Take an example of a scene from Pulp Fiction where Vincent and Jules discuss about Royal with cheese or the scene where a gang of gangsters discuss the importance of tips from Reservoir Dogs or Warren's investigation scene from The Hateful Eight and so on... At the click of a finger, you already understand the problematicness of this movie. How and why does he do it? I don't know.One of the other difficulties with the film that I actually overcame is his pace. I understand that a multitude of old classics scenes that are all filmed at 35mm are of no use to the content and thus create a boring atmosphere of the film, unlike me that I enjoyed and it enhanced my viewing experience. It's also a pretty good way to recreate the classics alongside the use of movie fiction content for the first time on the big screen. As the film progresses, the pace becomes tighter and that leads us toward the climax.One of the highlights of the film was the ending, and it's connected to the murders that took place in the US in the 1960s led by Charles Manson, and the famous murder of the Manson Family was the murder of Sharon Tate when she was pregnant that shocked the country. Manson himself did not attend these events, but he became one of the notorious people. I have to admit, Tarantino tricked me and I didn't know the ending was based on these events on my first viewing. Because we know the murder is coming, the tension begins to build long before anything happens. The director's use of his prior knowledge before the twist is impressive. He puts clues before the climax that no one would ever surpass. From this it can be concluded that all the clues were there all along. After all, this is \"Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood\", and you'll understand why.Overall, this is not his most exemplary film, but still a fascinating film by a wonderful director and sometimes a little cocky and sultry. It is a film that hardly allows for serious and deep discussion (except for the end, of course) and almost doesn't leave any material for thought to the viewer after the film. And yet, it allows the viewer to enjoy and transport him back to a crafted version of 60's Los Angeles.Score: (8.6/10)", "I love QT but this movie......": "I love QT but this movie is so bad I dont have words.As a movie this film is pure junk but if u watch it like a window into 60ties 70ties hollywood then you might like it, but as a movie it fails in everyhthing.I am hugly dispointed.", "Ahem...Helter Skelter": "Is it OK to say I liked Once Upon a Time...? Because I did like it. I enjoyed the feel of it, the music, the costume design; and I liked DiCaprio and Pitt, who deliver very good performances - by no means the best of their careers - but good enough to carry the film.Unlike others, I never felt the film was boring despite the quirky, disjointed storyline and the fact that it clocks in at nearly 2 hours, 45 minutes. The sudden switch to Kurt Russell's narration in the latter part of the film definitely seems off and was used as a way to sort of speed things along.Ultimately, what bothered me about Once Upon a Time... was the way it used the Tate murder. I could have seem the film work without the Manson family intertwined in it. Yet, after we are introduced to Sharon Tate in the film we have an expectation of where things are heading; at least until the shocking turn of events at the end.And although that ending is pure Tarantino and it will get you out of your seat, altering the truth of what happened just felt extremely exploitative. It left a bad taste for this viewer; one that I had a hard time getting past.", "the subplot should have been the A story": "Never thought I would rate a QT film so poorly, as he is one of my favorite directors, but this was dull. too much focus on the moviemaking process which may interest the studio execs greenlighting this, but is just not that interesting to ordinary folk. the manson family subplot should have been the main story.", "Don't get it??": "I saw the high rating and stuck through the movie waiting for something to redeem itself but nothing....nothing. Don't waste your time, this is terrible considering how good the cast is", "Mixed emotions ...": "Entertaining for sure ...But being \"around\" the Lee family ...\nTarantino definitely exaggerated for effect ...\nOr was simply misinformed ...Ashame ...", "Not coherent": "Typical Tarantino film. Sporadic. Messy. Uninteresting. The last 30-45 minutes was good. Almost walked out. Way too long.If he does do the next Star Trek movie I'd be concerned.", "The Halo effect in work": "So long and minutes pass by with no plot and nothing to catch. Seems to me Tarantino wanted to make a movie but had no idea what to make so why not just bring tow of the must celebrated actors in Hollywood and put in all the mishmash of movies he has seen in his entire life and make one!. Although I enjoyed the outstanding performance by the tow actors especially Brad Pitt but take their names of the equation and you'll have a movie with no Halo effect.", "Very good idea": "As someone who has read everything I could ever get my hands on about the Manson family, and to this day believe that Tex & Sadie were the real criminals in the so-called Manson killings, there is a lot to like with this movie.If I were related to Sharon Tate, this movie would depress the crap out of me as a \"might have been,\" proving that creating your own reality is the greatest value of movies.Nitpicks? Too many feet, knowing Tarantino's fetish makes that worse somehow. Lynn Fromme's voice was all wrong - should have been more airy, like a child's voice. Tex looked like a wimp. And an awful lot of filler. We need the Pacino arc at all. Way too many full scenes from tv shows and movies. Could've easily been 2 hours or even 90 minutes.That said, I love the Cliff/Dalton buddy angle, the dog, the cathartic ending, Margot Robbie, Jay Sebring, the cinematography, the music, and the Bruce Lee scene was fantastic!It's well worth watching. Loved it really.", "Not Tarantino's best, but he never has a worst.": "This movie bored me for the most part, just like Jackie Brown. I liked the acting and performances and the original spin on the history of the events, and the ending was the best part of the film, EASILY. The rest fell somewhat flat and I get why Tarantino made a film like this for his Hollywood buddies, but general audiences I feel like can't appreciate it that much compared to his other films.", "Quentin is the best": "Django unchained still my fav, enjoyed watching it", "This is a tutorial": "This movie is a guide to learn how to be an actor, a gaff, a stuntman..\nIt's a story.\nAnd in some weird way Quinton has made this movie more about two best friends making the best of things outside of their own lives.\nIf you don't appreciate this movie for what it truly is then you really don't appreciate Tarantino's movies as a whole.", "Brilliant acting.....": "Some of the absolute best acting I have ever seen. Decaprio, Pitt, and Qualley were all superb. Unfortunately, this is not a Pulp Fiction application of Tarentino's talent.", "Makes no sense": "If I could give this movie a zero I would. This movie makes no sense at all. I fell asleep on a off through out the movie. It sure does no hold your attention. What a waste of time. I think they all got together and got high and decided \"what the hell lets make a stupid movie and see how many people will go watch it\". I can't get over that it got a rating of 7.7! It surely deserves a ZERO!", "LA love-in": "A real Marmite movie. One that i liked on first watching, and a day or two later has actually gone up in my estimation. I've found Tarantino's last 10-15 years increasingly awful - long, overblown, questionable and dated. I came to this with lowish expectations and was pretty much blown away.The heartbeat of this movie is the fantastic chemistry between DiCaprio and Pitt(Redford). Thrown together maybe, but with a sweet, genuine friendship. Leo studied intensity and Brad easy smiles and laid-back charm. It's an exhilarating pairing.Tarantino sets his film in the months leading up the Manson family murders, letting the tension rise, like storm clouds rolling in to kill off the flower power 60's. Rick and Cliff symbolise the last gasps of classical Hollywood, now threatened by the decade's counterculture.There's no doubt the director feels greatly for Tate and the film's most tender scene sees her slip into a local cinema to watch her latest movie. Robbie comes alive as she giggles and blushes when people applaud, close to tears in the knowledge that she's made an impact (however small) on the world.The ending takes risks that will inevitably divide audiences - i hated it, but now think it's perfect.", "Interesting, but not that great": "I felt the storyline was weak. Some scenes were funny, but the 8+ rating certainly feels like too much. It is either due to the popularity of the two stars or baby boomers appreciating the nostalgic effect of the movie's time period. Sorry!", "Terrible movie that people watch just because \"love Tarantino\"": "The film is terrible...\nplot, dialogs, development, makeup...Even Brad Pitt. Feels like \"WTF am I doing here...\"It is like all Tarantino's movies... IF you watched one you watched all... just different actors and clothes everything else same bullcrapAnd people will shout that is \"amazing\" or \"art\" because they \"love tarantino\"", "Maybe on DVD, certainly not for movie theaters": "Leonardo and Margaret are the only things good in this movie.\nYou just wait for something to happen and no sense happen..Why would you even do a movie like that..\nWaste of everyone time.", "3 hippies gets killed.": "Basically if you have not worked in film industry, you cannot criticize this. To be clear, the first 2 hour is a depiction of old Hollywood. An outsider (inc me) can't nitpick on its factual nature. Insiders agree with the depiction. So it is factual. Some will say it's sluggish but it's only that if you aren't curious in nature. The 2 hour depicts the life of a diminishing actor, his stuntman & an ex actress. It divulges the personal life of the professionals. Not like your modern actors who act (better) off screen showing off their off screen life.Not a typical Tarantino movie but better because there realism in this. But it does have his signature over the top violence in the last 20 minutes. Must watch.", "Maybe it's just time to stop...": "... for him to make movies. I was even more bored than when I watched The Hateful Eight - like nothing really happens. If this would be a research paper, the question to answer would be: what if the Hippies would've killed the neighbors of Sharon instead of her? Well, who cares? Grade: F", "What's up with those 10s????": "I mean for real. This is nowhere near as good as the previous Tarantino movies.\n80% of it was all about he likes western. Literally.\nBrad and Leo do their job, indeed and the whole thing ends there.I pretty much like everyone Tarantino movie, but I do not consider him as a great director. He uses violence well, everyone expects only that from his movies and that's all.This little tribute to western movie is not giving us that.Up to date this is the worst Tarantino movie. The story should have focus on the actual things that happened that time. Instead of that we have to watch an actor who played in westerns which is not leading anywhere. With a little Tarantino because he expressed through Leo how he feels.Those that giving 10s for this movie should not be using imdb.\nYou're giving subjective reviews as you like Tarantino so much even when he doesn't do well, you still admire him.As he states always one can do only 10 movies. As I count he reached that number already. This explains this movie pretty well.", "Missed the mark": "First the positives, performances were strong. Brad Pitt the best performance in my opinion, Leo was good as always and I don't think Margot did much wrong but was hardly tested or utilised well. Film was amusing in parts, mostly down to Cliff (Brad)\nNegatives, was too long for what it needed to be, plot and real life characters inclusion at times seemed random and didn't felt like a cohesive story. Deliberated between an 6 or 7 but I found it entertaining enough, to not clock watch, although it crossed my mind a couple of times!", "Tarantino's worst film by far": "I know about the sixties aspect of the film & I usually love quentins work but I have watched this film three times now & every time i can't wait for it to end it's so tedious & boring & the pathetic end adds insult to injury not for me at all.", "Boring waste of time for anyone not getting paid to watch it...": "The only reason you would want to watch it is if you like the leading actors(Dicaprio+Brad pitt) or the 60s ambiance.\nI honestly don't know if Tarantino made this movie to mock hollywood, some of the viewers and all of the hack critics for swallowing up anything a known writer/director makes or he actually thought this was a gread idea of a movie...\nI am certain it's the latter.....", "A friend of mine said he couldn't finish it and walked out of the cinema...": "I figured he's crazy, till I watched it. I had to fast forward a lot... and I mean most of it. The ending had a pretty cool scene but everything else was either targeted at people who live in Hollywood (actors, etc) who REALLY care about the details, or old people who have the patience to sit trough boring, long, long shots of someone driving and nothing happening.This really isn't meant for younger viewers like me or anyone who couldn't care less about Hollywood. Seems to be for past and present Hollywood actors and showmen in general. It's moving as slow as movies did in the 80's back when people had the time and attention span to watch absolutely nothing happening for 3 hours, but it's a 2019 movie. Small tweaks could've made this more inclusive.I can't recommend this to your average viewer simply because you won't finish watching it, the only payoff is the film's climax which isn't that long or rewarding either. If Tarantino still thinks his 1992 style can work in 2019 and beyond - I'm afraid he should be prepared for only his circle of Hollywood yes men to watch his movies.", "This Movie Was A Major Disappointment": "Multiple storylines come together at the end. I'm surprised that Brad Pitt would do a film such as this. It is C-rated at best.", "Once upon a time in boring wood": "Okay loved everything of our beloved Q.T yet I found the Hateful Eight was just a snooze feast and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood I fell asleep after 30-45mins and woke up to the last 25mins (to all the violence).The Violence was weird and disturbing as should be yet one of the killing scene in pool (want add more as don't want to add spoilers to this review) was not funny.If someone else apart from Q.T made this movie it would not be a hit or win as much awards as it did.In fact another director would of not had enough control over this movie.What I did see was great acting-atmosphere-camera work.What I notice was what is the plot? It's a movie just for a movie retro times.", "disappointing and divisive": "I didn't see this one coming, everything on paper for this movie got me so hyped.\nPitched as a movie set around the Manson murders, Tarintino at the helm, Leo and Brad in the lead. My mind loved that idea.instead of a Tarintino manson movie i got a \"story\" of a washed up actor who quit drinking and got back on track? his stuntman who just...feeds a dog? people driving...\nthe last 20 minutes felt very Tarantino and what i came to see. but it wasn't enough to make me forget about the 2+ hours of bordum before.\nthe diologe wasn't what I'd come to love, music was all over the place, couldn't tell you one specific song, i heard too many.\nhopefully his tenth film is worthy of going out with a bang, this, was not.\nsaying that, i saw it with two friends, one hated it, the other loved every aspect of it.", "2+ hours of nothing, 20 mins of action": "This is Tarantino's worse film. It is 2+ hours about a made up TV star's career. There is no action or fun dialogue. There is a lot of driving around in a car and of course a foot scene. The last 25 minutes is what you want to see. I wasted so much time at the theater that writing a longer review would be adding to it. Thank you for reading.", "Patchy and ill-advised": "Tarantino's last few outings have been increasing divisive and have risked falling into self-parody but this film at least began more impressively. There are plenty of great performances to admire but unfortunately the overall effect is one of cheap manipulation for anyone familiar with the horrendous real fate of Sharon Tate and her friends and unborn child. It can be argued that Tarantino is rewriting history for the better but that just doesn't wash. He's clearly playing some very base moves which will probably either confuse or disappoint viewers depending on their familiarity with the true events. Tarantino needs to put his teenage impulses behind him and go back to producing a couple of truly brilliant cohesive and consistent films now if he wants to finish his career as strongly as he started.", "OMG....": "Great acting. Good cinematography. But what for?\nI was looking for a storyline till the very end. Found none, though.\nFans will be adoring it. Critics as well, they always adore what they do not understand. And there is definitely nothing to understand.", "An intriguing film": "Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood is an interesting feature. The premise appears questionable at first look, yet is ultimately quite admirable with its brilliant writing. As a revisionist of history, the feature wonderfully captures the aura of a past star with Robbie's endearing portrayal, even in a supporting capacity. The entire cast is outstanding, performing each role with conviction. Character development then proves very genuine, between an effective mix of emotionally impactful moments and thrilling action. In presenting clear, honest motivations throughout, the protagonists are easily likable, aided by the simply electric chemistry between DiCaprio and Pitt. Their character arcs are wholesome, driven by the constantly remarkable dialogue emblematic of a long lasting friendship, therein assisting the themes crafted. What also moves the plot forward is its leaning into the respective quirkiness of each scene, evident by the editing that relies on flashbacks and awesomely fitting cuts to story fabricated acting. The narration is uniquely fit into what occurs, although does feel thrown into the feature to provide sometimes unnecessary exposition. Still, it works decently even if somewhat jarring. Regardless, the film achieves in respectfully rewriting history while also powerfully encapsulating its central messages through to the conclusion. Altogether, the resolution proves highly satisfying, ending the feature in a spectacular fashion. The set and costume design, sound, and soundtrack all are beautiful, truly bringing the story into its old Hollywood setting. Cinematography is a highlight, with various intriguing shots that glamorize the production. The only true fault throughout is the somewhat randomness to what occurs, at times taking from the exciting developments and largely good direction to the story. Overall, this feature is a great addition to the Tarantino catalogue.", "Usual Tarantino self indulgence": "Heard it was not historically correct but didn't think it would take that turn. Shades of Marvel's \"What if...\" comics.Looked great, although lingered a LOT on tracking shots of 1969 Los Angeles. No real focused story. Sharon Tate was a flat character. VERY long but entertaining intro of diCaprio's character. Very self indulgent, but Tarantino is no stranger to that.I enjoyed diCaprio's take, but he's always very good. (Ironically thought him in Revenant was the weakest of his career.) Although good, puzzled why Pitt got the Oscar.Like The Hateful Eight, a very long, unnecessary, beating of a woman at the end. Why?", "Can't find positive word": "I was sitting and watching the film for 2,5 hours and there was no plot. Too much famous faces for nothing. Very very boring and nothing is connected. If i could rate the fair rate would be -10", "Misfire": "One would think a movie with Leo and Brad working off a script by Tarantino and being directed by him would be a slam dunk, but somehow they missed.Tarantino somehow managed to make them boring. Only two scenes were vintage: Leo's scene shooting as a villain in a Western and the very end.I firmly believe Brad's win was a sympathy vote for all of his years in Hollywood rather than actually thinking it was the best performance of the year. For me, that was Tom for his performance as Mr. Rogers.Maybe I'm a victim of my own expectations.", "Enchanting Fairy Tale Set In A Dark and Dirty World": "This movie is powerful, and it's got a melancholy feel to it. Yet it's funny and romantic too!Let me just say that Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio have never been better, and that they are both powerful in their dramatic scenes, while in the lighter moments they form an unforgettable comedy duo. Margot Robie is radiant as Sharon Tate. And this is a movie that will leave you feeling good about Hollywood, the movies, and just being alive.No, there are no spoilers here!", "Cinematic film without storyline": "Very boring film without a storyline. In the end they make a horrorscene. Weird movie that's way to long", "Tarantino's worst": "This movie is based on history, like Titanic. But imagine watching Titanic and not caring at all about Jack and Rose. Plus laughing while the boat sinks. That is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Leo does an excellent job acting though and there are some surprisingly funny moments which raise this movie to a 5.Wait to watch when you are stuck on an airplane.", "What did I just watch": "Brad Pitt and Leonardo talking for 3 hours. What was even the point of casting Margot Robbie? What was even the plot of this movie? There was absolutely no climax. What was the point of the hippies at the end? They just randomly show up? God have mercy.", "Half finished movie": "Nice images, I will say that. I was in LA recently so I enjoyed seeing it again and this time in the '60's.\nBut you don't go to the movie to watch pictures, certainly not with today's prices. With an all-star cast, you can play out any story. But in this movie, no story was played out. Yes, many stories were started, none were completed.\nThe all-star cast I am sure was handsomely paid to play. They have to ask themselves if this was truly a worthy step in their career. I saw no added value for having Al Pacino in the movie, though I generally like watching him. I even saw early in the movie some BAD acting from Pitt/Di Caprio. That should be unthinkable for these people, directed by such an icon.\nThen suddenly, at the end, a gory fight scene. There were some enjoyable twists in it, but the main question that remains is \"Why?\". Even Pulp Fiction, which is commonly scene as a collage of story lines, leaves the viewer with a better after taste. This scene did just not add to the movie. You could have seen it outside of the movie and enjoy it as is, without ever having to wonder what went on before or after.\nA unique feature here is the weaving of fiction into reality. We meet famous people, acted by other people. I particularly liked Bruce Lee's scene. Here again, it would be a lot more enjoyable if this was used somehow. Part of the movie is reserved for Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski's wife, visiting the movie theatre to see a movie that she starred in. Good for her. But not for the audience (I mean IRL, watching the audience of an LA theatre). There is nothing to see or learn or enjoy, or at least not in the context of the rest of the movie. There could have been, if it was offset against the decline of Risk Dalton's career, but that didn't happen. If QT wants to make a movie, he should make it for the people he wants to have paying for the movie. That's you and me. This movie was made for him to view in his own private cinema and keep it there. And that's a shame, because it could have been a wonderful experience of shots, sound, music, gimmicks, fight scenes, twists, turns and great acting.", "A journey into 60's Hollywood era": "Quentin Tarantino delivers once again a good movie, even if it is not for sure the best one. I still think that \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Django\" are unbeatable (for now), from every point of view, but this is just my personal taste.I have enjoyed this change of style, but I can understand that hardcore Tarantino fans are disappointed by its last job. Personally I was expecting too more violence as in \"Inglourious Basterds\" or \"Reservoir Dogs\", but I didn't mind at all the change in storytelling. \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a journey throughout the 60's Hollywood era. Tarantino decided to use the radio car to deep dive on those years, we always listen to some famous songs from the 60's, we always watch some small pieces of movies and TV series of the time, locations feel authentic, cars are beautiful and clothes are accurate. A director should also be able to change itself, and in my opinion Tarantino did goodThere is a good chemistry between Dicaprio and Pitt. Their relationship is very important and will evolve. Characters are in general very interesting and there are many big names involved such as Al Pacino and Margot Robbie. There are beautifully conceived scenes and I really liked to see Dicaprio portraying Bronco, it was funny and different.In my opinion to fully appreciate the movie, you need to do some researches on the 60's and especially trying to dig a little bit on the Manson family facts and researching what really happened that fatal night.I really enjoyed the movie and I strongly recommend it.", "Its interesting, intense and surely audience grabbing": "The movie does not focus on an entire story with the main characters but sub stories featuring different people on different stages giving a nostalgia of an older Hollywood setting, the cast is the main attraction and they did not disappoint. This movie is more related with reality of situations and definitely feels like it.According to my rating strategy:\nStory: 1/2, Task Fulfillment:1/1, Actors:2/2, Directing, Cinematography and Soundtrack: 2/2, Viewer: 1.5/2, Wow Factor: 0.5/1", "Tarantino's Journey Back To Hollywood In 1969": "Since the early 1990's, Quentin Tarantino has been one of the most unusual, eclectic, and, arguably, eccentric filmmakers in all of Hollywood. Known for a great deal of hipster dialogue, much of it admittedly profanity-ridden, as well for violence that, despite his disdain for it, frequently goes beyond graphic and occasionally approaches extreme levels, Tarantino, as such, is nothing if not fairly controversial. In 2019, Tarantino paid homage to the Los Angeles of the turbulent end to the 1960's with ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD.With a title that pays further homage to Leone (ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST; ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA), Tarantino's film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a fairly washed-up TV cowboy star who, along with his friend and stunt double (Brad Pitt), finds himself having to hunt down a job in a Hollywood film and television world in 1969 that neither man recognizes anymore. He lives in a fairly run-down home in the Bel Air Estates neighborhood of West Los Angeles, on a street called Cielo Drive, where his neighbors are the legendary ROSEMARY\"S BABY director Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierwucha) and his girlfriend Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), and he has chance encounters with, among others, Steve McQueen (Damian Lewis) and hairstylist-to-the-stars Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch). This is the hipster side of Hollywood that Tarantino focuses on for the first half of this 162-minute epic of his. But then Pitt makes a visit out to the Old West movie town in the northwest San Fernando Valley known as Spahn Ranch, whose owner George Spahn (Bruce Dern) has leased out some of his dwellings to a large family of hippie chicks, and a wanna-be cowboy named Tex Watson (Austin Butler), who are all part of a \"cult\" run by one Charles Manson (Damon Herriman). Their paths cross again on that fateful hot summer night of August 9, 1969 on Cielo Drive.As had been Tarantino's wont to do on his previous eight films (this one being his ninth), ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD contains more than its share of pop-culture references, including TV series such as \"Bonanza\", \"Wanted: Dead Or Alive\", \"The F.B.I.\", and \"Batman\"; and movies as diverse as THE GREAT ESCAPE, ROMEO AND JULIET, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, THE BOSTON STRANGLER, and THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, to name but a few. Tarantino's decision to cast Pitt and DiCaprio, two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, as his two protagonists was a brilliant move on his part, as both do really good work, although one could sometimes accuse the director of allowing them to kind of overact. The single most prominent part of the film, naturally enough, involves the two men's encounters with Manson and his cult, especially when Pitt goes out to Spahn Ranch, where he and DiCaprio's characters had done plenty of TV Western work, and where his encounter with Butler turns nasty. The decision to involve this grim Hollywood milestone and the presence of Sharon Tate as a principal character might have been a momentary bone of contention for Tate's surviving family, but Robbie's brilliant and effusive performance as the tragically slain actress earned plaudits from the family because of Robbie's astute and honest research of Tate's brief life.Along with amusing cameos from Al Pacino (as a slightly gaudy Hollywood CEO), Clu Gulager (from the 1960s TV western \"The Virginian\"), and vintage radio clips from KHJ-AM 930 \"Boss Radio\" (at that time, it was the top-ranked radio station in Los Angeles), ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD is very long and, at times, a bit irritatingly slow in its pacing; and it does have the usual Tarantino excesses of profanity and violence. But the ability Tarantino has to recreate the Hollywood of arguably the most politically and socially turbulent time in American history, though it cost a pretty penny ($90 million) is to be commended, as are the performances of Pitt, DiCaprio, and, especially Robbie, and Tarantino's use of the pop music of that turbulent time. Certain excesses aside, ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD clearly deserved its place as one of the best films of 2019.", "A true art of film making": "Self claimed expert critics and PC people are missing the point by asking what is the point. I want to digress a little by the ridiculousness of some criticisms: (1) \"Why was Margot Robbie not given more lines?\" Did those people ever stop to ask why the oscar winner Al Pacino was not given more lines? (2) \"Tarantino has some kind of anger and hatred towards women.\" They never say that about men when we killed them off in other movies. (3) \"What is the point of the movie? What is the plot?\" If you don't get it, ask others and STFU! Don't tell other people not to watch this movie. Alright rant over.Review: Not his best movie in conventional sense. Much more mature. He absolutely has mastered the art of controlling his audience like he is the conductor. People describe this as his love letter movie, his most personal movie, his most self-indulgent movie, blah blah. This movie is simple: a period piece: 1969 and the hallmark movements and events (hippies and Manson murders) in/around that year. Tarantino creates 2 characters Rick and Cliff and throws them into that period. The plot of the movie is about understanding what would happen if these two characters were present in 1969 doing things they did. That's it.Tarantino knows what the audience is expecting. He teases you in and out of moments at his will. He takes a slice of life of his two characters (first two hours of the film) and lets you observe them. Ask a private detective how boring it can get keeping an eye on someone. Its essentially that. In these two hours, he lets to get immersed into the 1969 hollywood: he shows you some people getting successful - like Sharon Tate (why her? because she is the one relevant to the plot. Tarantino is not wasting your time introducing useless people). He shows some commoners struggling (Rick Dalton). In the two hours you get a picture of who these people are. Its necessary because you know Sharon Tate (actually the more of you know of/about her the better. Do some research), people know. Rick and cliff, you don't. So you need to understand what these people care about, how they react to things, what they are looking for in life. Tarantino takes two hours to set this up. You can argue that this could have been done better. And I agree. But I don't really have problems. There are some great scenes and acting sequences and Hollywood nostalgia. The third act is the true purpose of his movie. How the three characters (Tate Dalton Booth and Mansonites) intermingle and affect the historical occurrence without Dalton and Booth. Tarantino takes what we know of history and affects it by introducing two characters. Will they change history in more brutal and sad way? Will his characters make it in Hollywood? Are his characters actually lovable at the end? Are his characters relevant in the end? These are the answers you will find at the end of the movie...in Tarantino style.I can't say if you will like it or not. If you are a Tarantino fan: absolutely must watch. If you are not, educate yourself about Sharon Tate, the 1960's LA, Playboy Mansion, Roman Polanski before you go watch the movie. I can assure you will tout Tarantino as a masterful genius. One thing for sure: this is a movie for the audience that wants to observe and figure the connections out and compares it with actual historical LA and events. It is not for the audience that likes to be spoon fed a plot and the punch line. And it is because it excludes this kind of audience I will give it 9/10 instead of 10/10. The problem with reading the critcs' comments is that you don't know which critic belongs to which type of audience.", "Yeah...no!": "A slow burn of a movie and even the Tarantino dialogue is drenched in stupidity", "The most pointless film ever.": "This movie was boring. Almost 3 hours for almost nothing to happen. A complete waste of time and money.", "Such a waste": "Complete waist of time. Boring the first 80% of time and then just complete nonsense... Really bad for Tarantino- seemed like he is running out of ideas. Ridiculous. The only good thing was Pitt and DiCaprio and their marvelous acting. If it wasnt for them, I would have switched it off and went to bed.", "Misogynist violent trash": "Typical Tarantino gore. Includes violence against women this time. Classy.", "Glacial": "I think Quentin has finally managed to disappear up his own backside. His self indulgence (whilst merely overbearing in 'The Hateful Eight') is total in this seemingly never ending meander through Hollywood's 'Golden' Age..The performances are superb - Pitt, DiCaprio and Robbie are all so very watchable and drag the rating up to 4 stars (one for each actor and one for the scene where Pitt beats up Bruce Lee). But the movie itself consists of, well, nothing. Nothing at all. The story of a fading actor and his side-kick is just not interesting. Sharon Tate flits around charmingly for no reason at all (as it turns out). The Manson Family come across more as an angry girl guide troop than the terrifying menace they actually were.\nIt's slow, slow, slow all the way without the slightest bit of suspense as we are subjected to scene after scene of people driving around whilst listening to the radio and inane movies within movies.\nThe diabolical murder of Sharon Tate and her friends is a crime so awful and a piece of American history so upsetting that to mess with the narrative is both insulting and pointless. How can one look for laughs in the shadow of Cielo Drive in 1969? Wow! They went to the house next door instead. Hilarious!Where has it all gone wrong Quentin? What a disappointment.", "Just wanted to be straightforward": "I should've given this film 1/10. I have it 6 just because the actings were perfect. On the contrary, the story was terrible.", "FAVOR for Y'ALL": "Do yourself a favor and watch all of the trivia!The ending made my jaw drop open, but then I read the book between 1972 & 1980. If you know the actual case, your jaw should also drop! I had to watch a couple of times to catch everything but sometimes I'm slow......", "A fantastic film!": "I hadn't seen this since it debuted and man, there is so much little stuff I missed the first time around as this is one of the busiest films ever. There is so much detail of another era, so many \"in\" jokes, so many famous names from the past as characters in the film, so many famous actors in big and tiny roles, so many jokes on the director's own past films, so much playing with facts and history, that I wonder how many it can be seen and still notice new things. This has an enormous cast and everyone, is fine, but while Leonardo DiCaprio may be the supposed lead, this is Brad Pitt's film. He is tremendously entertaining and is the showcase for a violent and very fun ending. I get restless when films run over two hours, but this 160 minute film could have been longer. The production design is amazing. The usage of songs from the era is delightful. Everything in the film including the score and the credits are reminiscent of the era it takes place in. The first time you see it you are filled with dread about how this will end, but then the brilliant writer/director of this, Quentin Tarantino, changes history and gives us a happy, sort of, ending. The whole thing is one of the most entertaining films ever made.Once upon a time....This is an adult fairy tale.", "Travesty": "Why must Quentin Tarantino insist on changing history? He needs to either write something original or stick to what actually happened. What an insult this movie is to the people who were actually murdered.", "Hollywood Golden Boys": "This is a great movie that has an old Hollywood feel. The reimagining of the Manson family stuff was very well done! Leo and Brad are perfect in their roles. Dark but also funny. Not as bleak as some QT pictures.", "Had read all about it before I saw it so knew what to expect. Liked it a lot more than I thought II would": "I can see why people didn't like it. In an age where everything is so 'immediate', this definitely lacks immediacy. It doesn't have suspenseful build up. It could seem terribly self-indulgent I guess. But I actually shed tears at the end, which surprised me. Tarantino re-wrote history in such way that I feel goes a small way to healing what happened at the time. I loved Inglorious Bastards, but didn't get that same sense at the end, and I think the difference is, that Tarantino genuinely loves Hollywood and film, and there's a level at which he personally feels the pain of what happened with Sharon. I never got bored...there were scenes which dragged a little for me, but I always felt Tarantino's love for his craft in those scenes, and there was always enough going on in other scenes to keep me interested. Brad was brilliant, Leo was brilliant, the two of them together were brilliant. Aside from the history re-write, it's basically a buddy-buddy movie, and I haven't seen one in a long time that I've really appreciated. Perhaps 'Sideways' was the last one. Anyway, I would definitely recommend it, but best to be prepared for what kind of film it is.", "I could easily go in for a Documentary than this": "Once upon a time in Hollywood came in with great cinematography and expectations, I give it to it. But same can not be said for the story, especially when it's a Tarantino. The story was slow, and a whole 2 hours was spent trying to make a point which eventually isn't worth it.This simply looks like the movie made because you want to test your new camera and cinematography skills.", "When did Tarantino get so... ridiculous?": "Tarantino's revisions of history seen in inglorious b*stards bored are replicated here with increasing ludicrous results.\nThe female characters in OUTIH are all one dimensional child like creatures whilst the male characters were given complex depth and history. There were some brilliant scenes with incredible acting, but all together the plot was a non-story followed by a bizarre ending that was essentially a slapstick comedy.\nThe writing was lazy and self indulgent and the amount of foot close ups (women's feet only of course) added another more intentional chapter to the Tarantino foot fetish discourse.\nTarantino has unfortunately lost it.", "Good but very slow": "This was a very long movie with way too many pointless plots. However, The acting was absolutely on point and even though I found it slow and pointless it still had me gripped. The ending was spectacular. A strange movie indeed but worth a watch.", "Anti-climatic...": "Shockingly Un-entertaining and lacking of blood for a Tarantino film. There aren't any shocking twist or characters that steal the show; it's a slow paced grind of a film. I love his films but this one lacks the luster of an Inglorious Bastards, Django, Pulp Fiction, or even Hateful 8. It lacks suspense. I did not find myself rooting for any character. I hoped something truly intriguing would happened but the closest It came to that, was a fight scene with Brad Pitt's character on a movie set. I would not watch this one again.", "Total waste of time": "QT made awesome movies, but this movie, had no point, no tension, storyline, the characters were in general flat. I had hope here and there, the movie would accelerate. After I read so many reviews I didn't understand why this movie has such a high rating. Most probably only because it is a Tarantino movie. Only Brad Pitt brought a little joy to the movie. And in the end, when something happened and the movie made me finally sleep, it was too late for some action. Till today I don't understand the positive reviews and why such a movie came into the cinemas. Most probably because Tarantino is on the label.", "Well this is a first, I fell asleep in a QT movie \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a4\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00b4": "I really wanted to love this movie, DiCaprio wasn't relatable, Margot Robbie was pointless, but Brad Pitt mildly ok.But what frustrated me the most was, WHERE ON EARTH WAS THE PLOT, NO STORYLINE AT ALL.

An incredibly stupid movie that I watched only in honor of Tarantino's masterpieces.", "Complete waste of Time & Talent !!": "It's definitely not for everyone. I am Huge fan of QT, Pitt & Decaprio but as I wasnt well aware of the real background so found this movie a complete waste of time. You will feel good with the soberness of characters and fine performances from all lead actors but the story plot never builds up and when the movie finishes i was wondering what was this all about.\nA complete waste of time when u have seen such terrific performances and excellent work from these actors & QT in the past.", "Fairytales": "Acting would get 10 stars but the storyline zeroed out so average of 5 stars is accurate. Only watch if you have nothing else to do.", "almost great": "Quentin Tarantino has tapped deeply into his humanity as he shares with us his take on the Hollywood scene of the late Sixties through the prism of a fading TV Western actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his aging stunt double and off-screen pal (Brad Pitt). DiCaprio combines the intensity of his roles in \"The Revenant\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" with the sensitivity and vulnerability of his early days (\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\" \"Marvin's Room\"). Tarantino again brings out the best in him as he did in \"Django Unchained.\" Pitt seems to have hit his acting peak about 10 years ago with \"Tree of Life\" but he has not declined; he's superbly effective when wisely cast, as he is here (and in his mid-fifties he still has the buff physique of a natural-born Greek god).Both characters have their soft and hard sides. With Pitt, it's the loyalty and sense of responsibility (to man and dog) combined with a killer's capacity to lay waste to adversaries if necessary. With DiCaprio, it's drunken rages and recklessless mixed with empathy and vulnerability, best displayed in scenes with a precocious child actress (Julia Butters, a female counterpart to Iain Armitage's \"Young Sheldon\"). The emotional high point of their relationship can induce both laughter and tears. Both reactions are appropriate for material of this depth and brilliance.Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, who happens to be DiCaprio's next-door neighbor, personifies the appealing side of that cultural Thing called \"The Sixties\" and does justice to the beautiful spirit of the actress whose life ended so brutally. Although the Tate murders weigh heavily over the \"metasphere\" of this film, Tarantino has a surprise in store.We are saturated with period detail (mostly from car radios, but also quotidian consumer products, movie marquees, vintage cars, costumes and re-creations of oldie TV and movie content). We even get dead-on authentic looking sequences from a Nazi-vs-Allies potboiler, hearkening back to Tarantino's send up of vintage German pop culture in \"Inglourious Basterds.\"What we have here is actually a modern Western, set in the fake West of mid-20th-century Hollywood but filled with car radios blasting pop tunes and news bits as well as the traditional horseback riding and confrontational violence. The scene where Pitt confronts the Manson followers at a ranch where they're living (formerly a TV western set) is the perfect blend of the two genres.Though it drags in places and some minutes are wasted so that Tarantino can indulge in one of his worst and most unnecessary habits, this film touches the heart.", "Beautiful, Melancholic and perfectly acted": "Oh boy, what an amazing movie, is not what you will expect from a QT movie, but is majestic on its own way, the streets, the cars, the amazing music of that utopic Hollywood in the 1960's, brillant. I was transported to a new world, yes is slow pace, but it's an acquired taste, it deserves to be seem at least 3 times, I promise that it gets better every time.", "The dog is the best thing about this movie": "I really wanted to like this but this is the worst Tarantino movie of all time. We follow washed up action hero (Rick Dalton/Di Caprio) through Hollywood in its heyday, but it's let down by complete lack of plot or character development.Scenes are well shot and the acting is pretty good, especially the dog, but it's set in a meandering narrative that made no sense, with characters who never change or develop and by the end I cared even less aboutThis movie manages to have an all star cast set in one of America's iconic periods without absolutely anything new or interesting to say about the culture, other than violence is cool. Studios need to stop giving this guy money to make films.Much like Rick Dalton's character, Tarantino needs to face the music, hang up his spurs and just move on.", "Don't fall for the hype": "I don't get all the hype.\nJust over 2 hours waiting for something to happen.\nFilm was good for 10 minutes.", "QA fail don't watch this movie": "QA Fail don't watch the movie.You never get your time back.", "Totally unique": "In my opinion, this is a great film; totally unique. Wonderful mood/atmosphere created by a beautiful pace, ferocious attention to detail, quite brilliant acting (full of subtleties) and an equally gorgeous soundtrack and set design. There are moments of hilarity, tension, tenderness and outright shock. I remember hearing QT once talking about how he sees himself almost as an orchestra conductor, with the audiences' emotions his instruments. Perfect example.", "Going Nowhere": "Love these actors, and this director, but somebody left this movie in a holding pattern over all other Q T films. And never let it land for more than a moment and then back into the air it went, just circling, circling, with wistful gazes at the action below.\nThere is a limited stopover, but that short respite does not a movie make.", "Happy that he didn't cater to forced appropriation": "The thing I love about QT is that he caters to himself and that's it. If you don't like it, it's all good. I respect that. However the one thing with some of his movies is that you have to appreciate a scene in and of itself, as opposed to the entire film, which can sometimes be a 'blah' story.\nGreat actors and cinematography/ budget. I just didn't get the story. Was so slow moving. What was the point? I will still see any QT film over PC Hollywood, but wasn't feeling this one.", "Refreshing": "Its refreshing to see something different to most of the garbage Hollywood has thrown at us lately. Tarantino's casting is just perfect. I think most of the negativity comes from those who just wanted a traditional Quentin Tarantino film of mindless violence which they did eventually get. I loved the 60s nostalgia trip back in time.", "One of the worst movies I have seen": "It is incredible to make such a bad movie with such good actors.A waste of time", "As usual, Tarantino defaults to a bloody scene": "The movie has a unifying concept: one-time leading man and his stunt double, now faced with taking secondary roles. DiCaprio does his usual fine job as the former leading man. His scenes are masterfully credible. And Pitt does an exemplary job as the stunt double, still capable of whipping the toughest in the business. And he does deliver his lines as always...seemingly straining to say something clever, but....\nAnd then we have our director, Mr. Tarantino. The vaunted director simply cannot deliver a movie without bloody, loud, persistent blood and noise. His core skill seems to be the easiest for any director...just slash, shout, shoot, and bleed. No thank you.", "Why does this exist?": "While I'm not the greatest Tarantino fan, so far all of his films have been enjoyable to watch. This one not so much.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is centered around an aging actor, his stunt double and a couple of other people working in the movie business. It has no cohesive story line but rather tells some incoherent episodic short stories, that aren't particularly interesting and ultimately lead nowhere. The last couple of minutes feature over the top violence which has become the Trademark of this film maker but it seems unwarranted here and makes as much sense as the rest of this movie (read: none)My theory is that Tarantino wanted to find out how bad of a movie he can make and still get praised by critics. The answer is: a very, very bad one. I give 3 stars because the actors are great and do their best to make the boring, nonsensical script endurable. Still I'd rather take those two and a half hours of my life back to do something else.", "It is formalite": "I do not like this, it confused me & it was not a stronge movie. Its my review.", "Fiction": "I lived in Los Angeles in 1969. The counterculture, sexual revolution, and drug experimentation were in it's early stages. There was nothing self concious about that time or that place that said wow look at us except maybe a Mama and Pappas song. California was half conservative and everyone respected law and order and unless you had long hair and didn't want to get a regular job you fantasized about being a rock star or a movie star until you realized you had to get a job. It's obvious Tarantino wasn't there and knows nothing about it. In fact Tarantino is projecting his current postdated worldview and using his knowlege of the 1960s to create a self conscious movie that says 'look at me I'm Quentin Tarantino - look at the movie I've made'. Should you see this movie? Have twelve dollars and bored? Better yet read books about Hollywood. Few books have been written about Hollywood in the 60s. Most of them were written about before the 1960s.", "Three hours of beautifully shot nothing... or is it?": "I saw the new Tarantino last night and I think my impressions haven't settled just yet. At first glance, this is a beautifully filmed, but empty film in which almost nothing happens, and seemingly without a point, so I understand the people who didn't like it. Honestly, I'm not even sure I fully understood it. On the other hand, the top cast, beautiful camera, Tarantino's directing, and some typically Tarantino's elements (although, at first sight, the film overall isn't his style), and most of all the nostalgic atmosphere of Hollywood from the setting of the Golden Age, leave an unexpectedly strong impression, and even in the slowest and seemingly the most pointless of moments it is not boring and has kept my undivided attention from start to finish. And those more versed in the era that the film portrays and events it skillfully insinuates will find additional satisfaction in innumerable details that will go unnoticed by the average viewer. I can not say that it is a masterpiece, but it certainly is a work of art, and is definitely worth watching, whether you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino or not.8/10", "New take on a Tarantino": "Coming into this film I expected the classic Tarantino style of high suspense, intense dialogue and sharp transitions. However, this movie turned out to be very different from the traditional Tarantino.\nPlot synopsis- Journey of a conflicted actor in search of western roles with his best mate/ stunt man. This movie also includes the historical context of the 60s/70s, introducing the Manson family and Sharon Tate's Hollywood experience.The start of the movie is very slow paced, although pivotal to the upcoming scenes of the movie and characterisation.-DiCaprio (Rick Dalton) plays a troubled Hollywood star, desperate for a legacy and to create a footprint in the film industry.-Brad Pitt (Cliff Booth) plays a relaxed and collected character who is loyal to Rick and essential to the sub-plot.Overall, the movie is extremely enjoyable with very memorable scenes:\n-Bruce lee fight scene\n-Rick acting as a villain in the spaghetti western\n-Manson household scene\nThe intricate detail implemented by Tarantino makes for a very symbolic and well formulated film.I would not consider this to be Tarantino's finest work, nevertheless the film is brilliantly executed with great acting performances and a classy and charismatic set style.", "No plot?

After this horrific waste of talent, film, and money, I hope Dicaprio is more careful in choosing his next movie.", "What a waist of time!": "Maybe the end of carrier for Tarantino? One of the most boring and pointless movies I have ever seen. Save the aggravation and skip it.", "Painfully bland": "I'll start by admitting that this film isn't my style in the first place but I still gave it a shot for the character list. Pitt is of course, outstanding. But that's about the only thing that I somewhat liked in this movie. It lacks plot, direction, humor, climax, and even a connection. 160 minutes and they still couldn't find a way to get this film on some sort of track. Just a very boring film with some good acting.", "A matter of taste but for me it was absolute crap": "OK so maybe I have different taste in movies but I didn't understand anything from this movie. To me and my girlfriend it didn't make sense.\nI feel it was meaningless and just a waste of 3 hours of my life and some money.\nTarantino needs good shrink in my opinion.", "Old Quentin finally found his purpose.": "What we always knew he was: a mirror. And here he comes, sans a stain. You got to love the guy, the only one left who knows how to make movies. Or pretty much so I guess. Or at least takes an interest in them.", "Unfortunately my expectations were subverted": "Tarantino always claimed he sees himself as a conductor. The filmmaking tools are his orchestra and we are his audience. He wants to be able to tell us what to feel and when to feel it.Well, what I felt for the most time here was - annoyance (and boredom).We often see clips of rick's movies, how he makes those movies and how he struggles with it (at that part my beer was empty and I went to get another one). There was nothing unexpected in the first half of the movie, just what the characters do in their daily lives.That was for the most part boring.My expectations for the ending were a lot different. That is why while watching the movie I enjoyed the Sharon Tate sequences. However after seeing the ending I have to agree that she was useless in this movie.What I liked:\n-Mirabella\n-cliff driving (haha)\n-cliff and his dog\ncliff's behavior at the end-most scenes with the Manson familyAt the same time the Manson family where sometimes the ones who annoyed me. Especially one of them in the end (you'll see).I expected more from the ending because of all the little hints in the movie that something bad ist going to happen. This film has some pacing issues.\nOf course the acting was great but that unfortunately does not help the other two crucial parts of the orchestra, the writing and the editing.", "How utterly boring": "To describe why this is boring is like reading Monthy Python describe why accountancy is not boring. Nothing happened, and what did not happen did not happen in an amusing or thought-provoking way.", "Interesting but not gripping - only Americans would appreciate": "The whole 2 hours is interesting, comedic and captures the 1960s for sure. Only Americans would appreciate the 60s culture this movie has captured.Story and characters just are not exciting, it's not gripping and just meh. Not like your classic Tarantinos.\nTo relate to Margot Robbie's character you must know about Sharon Tate's back story to appreciate what role she plays in the movie.\nThe last half hour of the movie is a solid Tarantino ending.\nI wouldn't pay to watch this if I knew what was in it for me.", "I totally don't get it.": "I totally don't get it & it made me fall asleep real quick.\nThe music is good, though.", "So poor": "Cool actors couldn't save this one. 3 hours worth of tedium.\nThe dog was ok.", "disillusioned": "I wish this was good. like that western hatchet movie Tarantino did... he chooses to reinforce annoying stereotypes, emphasizing not exploring racism, industry pedophilia. it feels slow not deliberate. I applaud the cast, the effort the costumes, the direction left me disillusioned.", "Leo and Brad are saving Hollywood or Tarantino might still be!": "Tragicomedy. Well, I got, albeit in a long and roundabout way, to the last picture of the eminent director Quentin Tarantino at the moment, whom I appreciate for his work and branded \"chips\" so to speak. I didn't get into the cinema, because the sessions were all evening, so I could only evaluate it now. And I can't say that I was completely delighted, and here's my brief opinion - Tarantino is still powerful! Since there were both unconditional pluses and minuses in the picture, therefore I finish with the introductory part and move on to the point.So the pros:\n1. Scenario - we do not take into account one point, which I will analyze in minuses. In general, the script is not bad, tragicomedian, even with a pinch of philosophy, and of life experience. It's 1969, the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the former celebrity Rick Dalton, together with his stunt double and friend Cliff Booth, must find their place in this world of cinema, because the old is already receding into the background, and the new attracts with its unknown. Both heroes go their own way and try not to lose themselves in this rapidly changing world, ready to absorb the old. If you love non-standard scenarios, and even more so the old Quentin - then you definitely come here! Maybe this is not his best scenario - but not the worst, for sure!2. Dialogues - old man Quentin did not disappoint, and it is interesting to listen to all this chatter. For Quentin is hardly the only creator who can make candy out of ordinary conversation. And although in this picture there are much fewer of these moments than in the previous ones, they are still interesting to watch and listen to! Here you listen to all this and understand that the conversation is about nothing, but how the phrases, individual words, even intonations are put - a master, a real master!3. Sixties - the old times got so worn out with the atmosphere: celebrities of that time (Steve McQueen, Bruce Lee, Roman Polansky, and so on), the Vietnam War, hippies, the anti-war movement, music of those times, clothes and so on. Old Quentin clearly loves these times and understands them very well, so I didn't worry about the atmosphere at all!4. Cast - I'll list everyone, because it will take a few minutes and will remind you of clerical work, so you don't even have to worry about persuasiveness and acting, because all the persons in the frame know their business for a long time and have already managed to prove themselves even once!5. Humor - laughed heartily in all moments, and for this I am very grateful to Quentin. Maybe the humor is slightly moved here, but this does not make it less funny. The only pity is that there is not much of it.6. Fights - bloody, juicy, brutal, although the intensity of all of the above is much lower than in previous Quentin films. Nevertheless, the locals have done well. Bravo!So the cons:\n1. Murder of Sharon Tate - and he is not here, it is even somehow offensive, because the second scenario line is focused on Sharon and her husband Roman Polansky. Her murder, together with her unborn child and friends, committed by members of the sect of Charles Manson, thundered all over the country, and forced Roman to leave the \"citadel of order\" for Europe. What's in the picture? Nobody attacks Sharon, that's all. So what for it was to prescribe the second script line, if it ends with nonsense anyway? Am I asking you Quentin? And how much pathos and advertising there was during the release of the picture. And the result is a bursting soap bubble. Very sorry.2. Slightly drawn-out - the picture is viscous in many moments, and this is bad, because Quentin had not seen anything like this before. The picture is full of drawn-out scenes and sometimes you want to skip them as soon as possible. Apparently the old man is slowly giving up. Well, let him release the tenth picture and retire until he rolled, like Ridley Scott, for example.A little about the main characters:\n1. Rick Dalton performed by Leonardo DiCaprio is a famous actor who played the heroes of a western in the past, and now starring in TV series as villains in order to feed himself and not lower his reputation even more. A whiner, an alcoholic, but at crucial moments he is able to pull himself together and give out an excellent acting game. Leo did not disappoint this time either. Well done!2. Cliff Booth performed by Brad Pitt - Rick's understudy, stuntman and his loyal friend who will help out in difficult times. A good person with a faulty past, because of whom he gets into various troubles. Brad is no less convincing and charismatic here than Leo.Yes, Quentin, you ended up filming a one-off picture, like Jackie Brown did. And it is not for nothing that many of your fans and loyal viewers after watching were divided into two opposite camps, because the first camp considers this picture a \"masterpiece\", and the second - fiercely hates it. It remains for me to stand exactly in the middle, because the picture has both pros and cons, and it cannot be called a \"masterpiece\" (unlike most of your previous works). But being disposable is almost an insult to you. It's a pity, but you can't hide from the facts.As a result, we have a good tragicomedy with disappointed expectations, a good script, excellent dialogues, the atmosphere of the sixties, not without drawbacks, and great acting work.My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!", "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood: Movie review": "'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' is a comedy-drama on which Quentin Tarantino worked as a film director and as a scriptwriter. The movie was released in 2019 and was well-received by critics. The movie starred Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie.In my point of view, this movie needs to be watched at least because it mirrors the particular period of American history. It guides the audiences through the atmosphere of 1969. This movie raises acute questions that worry and cause a stir the minds of people nowadays too. Great acting and wonderful script unconditionally attract attention to this picture.'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' is a kind of a fairy tale about Sharon Tate's life, which have never come true in reality.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska", "The Weakest Link": "Of all Tarantino's films, this one must be the weakest. He usually allows the storyline to open out gradually before his audience, but this movie has a very slow, thin storyline that never really gets going. It also features numerous incongruous threads that leave the audience scratching their collective heads, asking \"so what did *that* contribute to the overall plot?\" The acting from DiCaprio and Pitt is strong: VERY strong. However this thin, slow story just doesn't do them justice. As a Tarantino fan and general 60's buff, I was left disappointed.", "QT Delivers": "Amazing acting throughout - my rating of \"8\" is based on the fact that QT gives us the same non-history ending he gave us in his film \"Inglorious Basterds\" (which I give a 10) - It felt to me like he ran out of ideas by stealing from himself. Otherwise it was an interesting experience to watch this story unfold.", "Pretty Good Tarantino Satire!": "Leonard DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie star in Quentin Tarantino's 2019 comedy-drama. This mainly takes place in 1969 L.A. focusing on\nactor, Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) who is an alcoholic, his long-time, stunt double,\nCliff Booth who is a war vet (Pitt) and actress, Sharon Tate (Robbie) who had a tragic fate by psychopath, Charles Manson, but the film depicts it differently. Kurt Russell, Al Pacino, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, and the late, Luke Perry are also featured. This is a pretty good satire with a great cast, humorous moments, and typical violence and profanity which no Tarantino film would be complete without. Give this one a try and don't take it so serious.", "Was there a plot?": "Watched this for 3 hours and I'm not sure if there was a plot at all? The acting, costumes and set were good though. This movie just didn't seem to have a storyline or direction", "Definitely not perfect, but a treat for film lovers": "Polarizing movies are some of my favorites to watch. This most recent Tarantino piece is no exception.The flaws in this movie are the same flaws QT always has-but I'd argue the same for his strengths, which this film also has in spades. I would argue this is his best work in world building, and some of the best acting performances he's brought out on camera. For a nearly three and a half hour film, there were only a few moments where I could feel it (unlike the Hateful Eight, which had the opposite effect).This movie's first priority is obviously to pay homage to the era it portrays, but any complaints about a lack of plot seem unfounded to me. There was plenty of plot, enough to give the movie some direction, and left plenty of room for ample character development and really fun references to both real events and fictional.Far from a perfect film, but a fun few hours for those of us who love movies and love Tarantino's portfolio.", "Surprisingly boring": "I can watch low budget films to give them a chance. But this??? What the heck. A list actors wasting my time like this is a shame.", "Tarantino doing what Tarantino does": "The ninth film from the legendary director Quentin Tarantino - depending on how you count them - and once again we're taken straight into the past, where everyone dresses cooler than you ever will, the music is better, everyone is suave like you wouldn't believe it, violence has a prominent place in society and everything just has that vibe to it.In this particular instance we're in Hollywood. It's the end of the 60s. The hippie movement is going strong, westerns are slowly dying out, narcotics flow freely and there's something in the air. We follow three main characters. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a fading star of westerns. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), his stunt double with some questionable skills. And Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), Rick's neighbour, who's about the attract the attention of some real bad apples.What separates this from previous Tarantino films is the lack of real plot. Sure, things happen and they even kind of connect in the end, but it's still a very meandering film. For example, pretty much all the Sharon Tate scenes have nothing to do with Rick and Cliff. Or if they do, it's very peripherally. They're still talking about the same city, the same era, the same business, even the same people, but from another perspective.Personally I didn't mind. It's still the same quippy Tarantino stuff I've grown to love, but I can see how it can be a problem for some people.And, truth be told, this is not the best film Tarantino has ever filmed. The lack of structure does mean that it doesn't quite have that edge some of his other films have. That being said, it's still miles and miles above almost anything else to have come out in recent years. It's violent, it's witty, it's cool. It has amazing characters, even better dialogues and some unbelievable scenes. The end fight scene might very well be one of the best Tarantino has ever filmed. If not the best. And that's saying something.Do you like Tarantino? If yes, see the film. If not, it's not going to change your mind.", "Self indulgent? How selfish to say that!": "Personally, I'm not a fan of the 60s/70s so I can't say I'd enjoy that aspect of the movie in such depth, but I don't see why people have to criticise Tarantino for making a movie about what he likes, I'm sure he knew a lot of people would enjoy the story and a lot of people did!!\nPeople calling the movie self indulgent and rating it 1 is just childishly unfair.\nThe movie is heavily focused in portraying the life in Hollywood (no misleading movie title here!) and there's a lot to do that. The ending has to do with the times where the film happens, but it's a Tarantino take of them, and there's your share of director's signature violence.\nIf you're watching a Tarantino movie you know you'll get long scenes of characters speaking and he's (in my humble opinion) the best at these, so what's the complain about this particular movie?\nThe main characters are great, as expected from these two great actors. The secondary characters are nothing special in my opinion, but everything was entertaining for me, didn't feel as long as it is, and certainly not boring.\nI definitely wouldn't say it's his best movie, mainly because of the story, but Tarantino's movies entertain me mostly for his dialogues and tense situations and I definitely got that here.\nGood movie, a bit experimental with all the clips cuts, but it's still fun, classic Tarantino.", "An OK Tarantino film only.": "DiCaprio & Pitt have great chemistry.Clearly Tarantino wanted to make a movie about the Charles Manson murders.Unfortunately, this film only hints at them in a very weak way & the \"ending\" is underwhelming to say the least.", "I wish there was more of Margot Robbie": "This was the first movie I watch starring Margot Robbie where she is not an obnoxious crazy killer (\"Suicide Squad,\" \"Terminal\"), so I am so sad I didn't get to see more of her normal side in this movie. Other than that, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio's characters are excellent and very affable.Good job, Quentin Tarantino!", "a lot of interesting little details": "What do you think about when you think about Hollywood in the'60s? A Raucous, fast-paced Promo, a big star interview, is the beginning of the film. And, of course, the vibrant American Spirit, the perpetual parties, the strobe lights, the car radio, the spinning gramophone, the Vanity Fair, the human connection... in Quentin's eyes, Hollywood was as expansive and inclusive as the West, on the surface, there is a bleak human nature, complex emotional interweaving, everyone can pursue the dream of film. Quentin tells the story of a \"making a Western\" , using fan material and the story of a movie Dream Star and his stunt driver to piece together the old Hollywood dream of a Western's texture and spirit. It was as if he was using nostalgia to express his dissatisfaction with the state of Hollywood. \"This is Hollywood, \" he shouted with unrestrained emotion. \"What Are you devils up to? \" If the film is extreme, the director behind it will become more rational; If the director is emotional, most of the films aren't that extreme", "Non-existent plot": "The movie is only pleasing visually. It lacks essence and gets nowhere by the end of it. Waste of time and money.", "The cinema love letter.": "Once upon a time in Hollywood.\nSlooooooooow build up.\nGreat dialogue.\nFantastic ending.\nGreat performances but I'd hold back from saying oscar worthy. They dont stretch themselves really, just doing what they do best.\nAnd the gore and violence doesn't come until the end but its 100% justifiable and agreeable.\nThe first real laugh in the cinema didnt arrive until approx 1 hour in.\nThis is not a bad thing.\nIts beautifully filmed and especially for the Tate family a fantastic tribute to all that is Hollywood.", "Boring, no story, waist of time": "This is not a slow burn, its the slowest movie in the world with no plot at all. Yes acting or cinematography are good, but that's not enough to make a good movie. People no longer have a taste or critical thinking for whats deserves a good rating. They just want to find anything to praise only because dicaprio was in it. I wasted hours of my life on this movie.", "Characteristically Brimming with Quirky Forms of Life, if Not Particularly Motivated to Get Moving": "Quentin Tarantino's back, with a grand posse of his favorite actors, to tackle the faded sheen and troubled dreams of celebrity life in Hollywood during the late '60s. Although their subjects are quite different, this film's structure is very similar to the preceding Hateful Eight, in that it takes forever to get where it's going and tends to linger on short, irrelevant asides that add to the tapestry but don't have much influence on the greater plot. It's loaded with flavor, lovely little touches that bring a very specific slice of life back into the present, but after a while it begins to feel over-indulgent. As if the director just wanted an excuse to recreate a beloved time and place, then take a stroll, breathe the air and look around.Once Upon a Time is peppered with entertaining performances and amusing cameos, with particularly impressive work from Margot Robbie as the sweet, sunshiny Sharon Tate and Brad Pitt as a guarded, past-his-prime bachelor in the John Wayne mold. The city and studio lots all look great, bustling and alive, with various characters' paths crossing in a string of complex, delightful coincidences. And the last scene, loosely (er, very loosely) depicting the Manson family's violent siege on the Hollywood Hills, is pure Tarantino. Chaotic, gratuitous violence, rampant unpredictability, explosive payoffs... crookedly wonderful in the most wicked of ways. I don't want to spoil anything, because the surprise is part of the fun, but at that moment it changes gears from Hateful Eight to Inglourious Basterds. You'll know what I mean if you see it.I didn't dislike this, but I didn't love it. It certainly would've benefitted from some selective editing and smoother pacing. I think the importance of Sally Menke, Tarantino's longtime partner and behind-the-scenes collaborator, who died in 2010, has been evident in the director's recent output.", "I found zero meaning in this film": "No plot, no depth. Tarantino used two of the greatest actors of all time to create a movie about literally nothing and profit millions. People are like \"this film is fantastic\", I literally lost brain cells doing my best to take any value from the plot, story line etc. I have liked his films of the past but this one was 2.5 hours of time wasted for 3 minutes of actual content. Terrible and had so much potential with the cast and Tarantino as director/writer.", "Dumb": "Maybe one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. Don't waste 2 hours and 40 minutes of your life...", "instead of making great films, all we can now do is refer to great films": "There's one moment in this, when DiCaprio is berating himself for his alcohol-fugged inability to remember lines, that actually feels real and based on someone's genuine experience. But it only highlights how arch and false almost all of Tarantino's work is: as hollow as Brad Pitt's acting. Both of them know how to put on a show, but there's no soul to what they do.How can the top review here say that this is 'an important film in cinema history', whilst recognising at the same time that it is largely made up of references? It's not great; among other things, I think that - among other things - it's actually about our footling, post-modern, end-of-the-cycle inability to be great, and recognising that 'important films' are a thing of the past, .But that's not to say that it's not kinda fun; in fact it's as good as any film could be which is basically just a ride in a Hollywood theme park, a toying with genres and references (like Kill Bill, but much more enjoyable). You do need knowledge of the period and of film history to understand it fully. There's a good performance by DiCaprio and it's a pity the character isn't explored more deeply; instead we have a sort of love note to schlocky real-life actress and Manson victim Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie does a fantastic job of bringing the part to life with almost no lines). The presence of the Manson 'family', flagged up early on but for a long time not used, makes you think you know where it is going - but it ends up not quite what you expect. Let's just say, it's what we might wish had happened rather than what actually did.In the end, nothing is allowed to spoil the glow that suffuses the film - both figuratively and physically - from a time which is supposed to be Hollywood's golden age but when, in fact, most of its greatest achievements were yet to come.", "Incredibly boring.": "It's slow.It's very meandering and doesn't grab you.It's laced with shots of people's feet, it's pretty clear this movie exists to satiate Tarantinos foot-fetish.It's boring as heck. I legit filed expenses while this was on. QTs 2nd worst film.", "I found it thoroughly engaging": "Wonderful re-creation of 1969 Los Angeles. While there were a few small anachronisms, Tanantino's obsessive attention to detail served him very well. I found the movie thoroughly engaging. I see a lot of criticism on this site about the movie's slow pace, or what they consider pointless scenes. I guess if you watch all of the \"superhero\" movies that Hollywood mostly puts out these days, you can't sit through forty minutes without an explosion, or a car chase, or otherworldly CGI. There is actually great cinematic value in getting to know the characters. I can't say much about the plot without spoiling. I was very happy that I knew nothing of the big twists in this film, and enjoyed them immensely. Great acting by everyone, good direction, fantastic photography. Definitely worth seeing. (If you don't know much history, then this film is probably not for you.)", "An excellent movie, if you're looking for a memory trip": "Many comments on here saying it's long and boring, and has no story.\nWell, it is long, but it isn't boring if you remember that era, basically, over a certain age like me. I'm not saying all under a certain age won't enjoy this film, many love the 60's and 70's era, and will enjoy the attention to detail that is in this film, as I did.\nAs for the story, you do take a while to figure out what the story is going to be, and unlike other Tarantino movies, there's no heist, gangsters or drug smuggling plots to be had, just the lives of a struggling actor who was on the verge of super stardom, and his double/stuntman.\nI found their story to be intriguing, mixed with the famous people of the time that crop up (at last Damien Lewis gets cast as Steve McQueen, if only briefly)\nAlso, in typical Tarantino fashion, the end has plenty of blood and an historical change as well, as did Inglorious Basterds.\nThe acting is top notch from everyone, but mainly DiCaprio and Pitt, and the 2hr 41min just flew by for me.\nAs with all films, go in expecting the best film ever, more than likely you'll be disappointed, go in with your expectations a little lower (as I do with every movie these days) and more often than not you'll be pleasantly surprised.", "Aimless romp": "Seeing this film on IMAX was a real thrill. The spectacle was worth every penny spent. Outstanding acting, interesting characters, gorgeous cinematography and plenty of laughs.So why 7 stars?This film doesn't really have a plot. It feels like an interesting snapshot into the lives of a few interesting characters in the late 60s. It's Tarantino, so everything is beautifully shot obviously, and quirky obviously. There's also lashings of extreme violence... obviously. It's just missing something significant to knit it all together into a coherent narrative. I'm still not quite sure what the point of Margot Robbie's character was, other than to exude stunning beauty and optimism.This film feels a tad self indulgent, as if there's an undercurrent of in-group know-how about it all, a nudge nudge wink wink towards film history nerds, that might escape many of us who aren't in the film industry and don't live in Hollywood. In other words, most of the audience.In saying all of that, I enjoyed every second of it, but I was as much enjoying another dose of Tarantino's film making mastery, as enjoying a coherent story with a beginning, middle and end. It feels like Tarantino on freestyle mode, not worrying too much about having things hang together. Just putting a few interesting snippets of film together, with brilliant and beautiful actors, in a fairly loose way without bothering to connect it all. Why does it need to be connected? Maybe it doesn't...A brilliant but slightly unsatisfying journey into late 60s Hollywood craziness. Maybe 7 is a little bit harsh in this one but 7 it is.", "Worth the wait": "Now as a big fan of quentin's movies, i gotta say this movie is slow at first but the it's definitely worth the wait!", "Tarantino went way over his head with this one": "Up until the opening credits started rolling, I completely forgot that this was a Tarantino film. That being said, I went into this movie with my sister and enjoyed way a lot more than she did apparently. The fact that I enjoyed it, however, does not mean that I thought everything about it was great/perfect. Allow me to elaborate.Pros:1. The acting - All I really have to say about it is that Pitt and DiCaprio have astonishing chemistry with one another and play their roles spectacularly well.2. The western scenes - The way each of those scenes were directed made me keep wondering whether or not those scenes were part of a movie-within-a-movie, and that is exactly what I loved about them.3. Bruce Lee - I don't know if I can describe the scene with him without giving anything away, but here it goes: the man gets his ass kicked by Brad Pitt's character.4. The scenes with Brad Pitt and that one Manson girl - Nothing much to say about it except that I found Margaret Qualley absolutely adorable as that character.5. The scenes with the child actress - All I can really say is that I flat-out loved the scenes with Leo DiCaprio and that little girl. I especially loved when he asked her if she's 12. To which, she corrects him saying that she's 8; at that moment, I was like, 'Wow, you've grown up fast.'6. The makeup - I can barely wait for this film to get nominated for best makeup design, because Timothy Olyphant and Dakota Fanning were almost completely unrecognizable; the same can be said for Margot Robbie as well.Cons:1. The run-time - I'm not the first one to say this, but this film was a lot longer than it needed to be; nothing more to it, I guess.2. Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate - Now, let me be perfectly clear and say that I in no way dislike her as an actress; I have seen I, Tonya after all. The problem I have is that she (besides playing the real-life Sharon Tate) had no purpose in this whole film whatsoever. The movie does, however, lead us to believe something bad is going to happen to her, only to trick us later on.3. The climax - Most (if not, all) of you may know the tragic story of Sharon Tate: she was a Hollywood actress who's life was cut short by few of the Manson family members. That being said, Tarantino decides to completely alter that tragic night and has the stuntman go all one-man-army on each of them; he even has his dog give him a hand for most of it. Now, the fact that this is a Tarantino film, the climax is incredibly violent and brutal; watching a young girl (psychotic or not) get viciously attacked by a dog, screaming out in agony before getting blow-torched to death (while another one gets gets her face smashed in repeatedly by a fully grown man) does not equal as entertainment for me. I honestly thought that it was downright unnecessary and felt added in purely for shock value. I know I'm making it sound like I was rooting for the Mansons the whole time, but hear me out. During their amount of screen-time, we never see any of them murder a living soul, which is why having (three of) them get killed instead seemed and felt unneeded.4. The ending - It shouldn't be surprising that Sharon lives in the end. I, on the other hand, have very mixed feelings about it. I mean, there is insulting our intelligence ... and then there's THIS. On the one hand, it was nice to see Leo finally interact with Robbie (again) near the very end. But on the other hand, it makes her presence in the whole film entirely pointless. Like I said earlier, the woman does nothing in this film other than go to a movie theater only to watch \"herself\" on the big screen. I've read many people praising both that scene and the ending, which, for me, goes to show little respect they have for actual event. I mean, come on, Quentin, there are fan-fiction writers who show more respect for real-life tragic events like this.All in all, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is a good film, just not a great one, but it would've been if not for the ending. And in my honest opinion, Tarantino should stick to writing new materiel instead of using his own fantasies to tamper with real historical events. So I rate this film 7.5/10 stars.", "What was it about?": "I'm not the biggest fan of Leo, he's incredible in some films like Blood Diamond and the Departed but I don't know why I just don't like him in Tarantino movies.\nAt the end of this movie, I was left with the thought, what did i just watch?!. It didn't make sense to me at all. It seemed to be a lot of different ideas placed together with no real connection. So I didn't like it.", "An awful movie": "A total disappointment from Tarantino.I wish he did not make this movie.There is no story.You just watch old times like a boring documentary.", "Once Upon a \"Crime\" --": "As most people have said, nothing happens. Sure at the end something happens for like five minutes --- but you feel toyed with, manipulated, lied to and led down a dark hole leading to nowhereland. I mean nothing at all happens for the entire movie until the end. Montage after montage of footage from other films, etc.. etc... You know what I think? There was a line in the movie stating that all good movies are about violence and murder and without it, a good movie cant be made. And this movie SUCKED for the entire time there was no violence and murder. Except for the last ten minutes where. I think this was Tarantino trying to keep a movie CLEAN -- I think he finally tried to make a movie that had nothing to do with killing or blood or crime. I see what he tried to do --- but nonetheless WOW this was really boring unless you were in Hollywood in that era and could appreciate the aesthetics --- this will bore you to death.", "Tarantino is a crazy dude and I love him!!": "I just finished watching the movie, now I can take \"watching a Tarantino movie in a cinema\" off my list, I thought I was going to watch the movie in IMAX but apparently Tarantino still shoots his movies old school kinda .. and oh boy I'm glad he did!! So if you go watch it in Cinema just don't sit in the first 5 rows or so .. and watching the movie in a cinema where the rows are split in the middle which gives you that old nostalgic vibe which I liked just like when I watched Cold War, I felt like I'm watching a movie in the golden age of cinema.\nBack to the movie .. Tarantino never disappoints .. he did things his way .. this time he wanted us to laugh a little so he add a little more of comedy than he used to in his movies .. all the cast was on point .. I liked the atmosphere between every actor .. Brad and Leo are Al and Robert if this era .. the director's picturing Hollywood 50's and 60's were top notch .. the cuts between every scene is so neat, you feel like it's a movie inside a movie, he fills every scene .. he leaves nothing for no purpose .. every scene had it purpose in this movie .. you'll definitely have a Tarantino touch in this movie if you know what I mean .. not his best .. but in the last decade .. it is ..", "(Updated review) Recommend, but does require some base knowledge of real events": "I'm 1 hour and 15 mins in and still 1.5 hours to go. I have no idea where this is going, but if nothing is happening in 10 minutes, I'm giving up. And for someone who doesn't like movies lasting more than 1.5 hours, I really think I'm giving it my best shot.\n- - MAJOR UPDATE - - -Ok, I finished the whole movie (taking a break an picking it back up the next day). And yes, in the end I do really enjoy how this movie unfolded. Yes, it starts out slow, but a slow setup was needed to have it all come together in the end.I must say, I started watching this without knowing anything about the back story and not even realising this was partly based on real-life events (I guess I was slow picking up on that). Once I realised that, I had to google a lot of characters and events to make sense of it all. But to me, that was worth it and made it all the more interesting. And it puts the ending on such a different light.So yes, conclusion is that I did enjoy this movie after all, but it does require some base knowledge. Bumped it up from 5 stars to 7 stars.", "Didn't get it the 1st time": "Didn't understand the humor of the movie that led into the shocking violence at the end. Then realized, anyone would have wanted to see those things done to the Manson family murderers that night to save Sharon Tate and the others. The 2nd time I watched it, the voice of Sharon coming thru the speaker, \"Is everyone alright?\" nearly broke my heart. I thought, ohh, if only everyone had been alright! Her, the baby, her friends...I did not think of this as a comedy, not sure why it was labeled as such. Anything pointing to the Mason family horror, anything showing Sharon Tate on the screen in any form...couldn't lay \"comedy\" on it at all.", "Worthy of an 8+": "People who writes reviews where they say they 'usually like Tarantino flicks' are just after action and the usual way his movies are layerd. Just because most of the movie isnt like his usual movies, it doesnt mean its bad. You cant give it a 1, 2, 3 star just because he explored new areas of film making.", "I should have walked out like the others!": "You ever hear the expression silk shirt on a pig. The actors in this move are the silk shirt the script is the pig.", "I want a refund.": "Please don't waste your time. The film goes no where. You spend 2 hours waiting for a plot and the last hour wanting to leave. I don't know how this film has got such a high rating. It's literally just nothing.", "Lousy movie but totally representative": "A worthless piece of bad acting and no script. Don't waste your time or your money. Read yesterday's newspaper for better entertainment. A number of people walked out- including me. Tasteless inclusion of Sharon Tate.", "No plot. Slow.": "Most overrated movie I ever saw. Weak plot. Extreme slow in the first two hours. Never saw so many people walk out of the cinema. Too many open ends. Tarentino is my favorite moviemaker but this one...", "What was the plot?": "This movie had no plot. Nothing happened. Leo was a fading actor that got his mojo back, I guess. Pitt was a nobody throughout the movie. The last 15mins was good. Otherwise what a snore fest. Only thing kept me watching was a lot of big name actors kept it alive. Was there even humor in this movie?", "Slow like a turtle": "Movies is slow like a turtle. Disappointed. Waited for this movie from long time but it turned in boredom.", "Leo and Brad Pitt!!!!!!": "A love letter to Hollywood and probably a personal therapy session for QT. I think Leo's character might represent the voice in Tarantino's head. An aging actor, questioning his own relevance and ability to make an impact at this point in his career. Leo is great as always, but Brad Pitt unsheathes his coolness and likability in ways that he is rarely allowed to. Both of them are perfect in their roles, and are so enjoyable to watch. My only complaint is that the first act, in my opinion, felt a little slow, early scenes where Leo was alone, I thought were kinda boring, and the whole playboy mansion section felt completely useless. Besides that I thought it was fantastic, It was well acted with an amazing cast, both leads should be nominated for BEST actor, the soundtrack was great, the recreation of Hollywood was insane, if you are familiar with the area, it's probably even more awe inspiring. The ending was the best part, it was violent and over the top and hilarious in a way that only Tarantino could pull off.It was also just a nice message from Tarantino to lower tier actors. Actors who just aren't quite talented enough or who maybe didn't get their shot, that their work matters, it matters to him and to others, even if it's just playing a bad guy for a week on a cowboy show, or nowadays a criminal on a police procedural.", "Enough with the foot fetish stuff, Tarantino!": "It's so in your face that it's totally ridiculous. For a pretentious movie, trying to be all so authentic, cool and artsy, it is laughable that Tarantino injects his personal fetishes in almost every shot and in every film he touches.", "Brad Pitt finally made a bad movie": "I was just thinking before I recorded this movie and attempted to watch it that I had never seen a movie starring Brad Pit that I didn't like or that I considered to be a bad movie. Then I watched this boring, pointless, Tarantino piece of garbage and corrected myself. Yes, I guess he has made some klunkers.I tried very hard to think of a movie I have seen that is more tiresome and pointless than this movie, and the only thing I could think of was the endless scenes of Benji the dog running in Benji the Hunted. If you took your kid to that movie back in the day and found it intriguing, then you might like this one. Be prepared, however, to be completely disappointed.", "Alot of waiting for something to happen": "Over half of the movie is very slow but the last 30 or 40 minites really pick up and make up for it so if you are going this just lower your expectations and try not to walk out the showing cause alot of people did and missed the main event which is the ending.I felt that the bruce lee part should have been left out there was no point of that other then if the makers just wanted to stir up some controversy for more hype.Even though most of it was slow it is still very enjoyable but not as good as hateful eight which was fun all the way through.", "The most unique idea yet by a screenplay": "The dialogue isn't typical Tarantino fact providing or of that unique nature unseen in atypical films but that maybe for a reason as we instead find ourselves insane with curiosity where this film is going and in the end WOWed like Iv'e never been WOWed before by an ending in my 45 years of existence.", "Quentin Tarantino's Homage to The Way Hollywood Was": "It has been many years since I have left the movie theater with that... that feeling that I used to get after watching a great movie. It was as if I left the theater on a summer evening sometime in the mid to late 90's and I'd just watched a film about the summer of '69. As a millennial I remember having that feeling many times after seeing great films like Titanic or the action movie Bad Boys(I know random) and Goodfellas. I started to think maybe I was just becoming too critical of newer films and maybe I should just accept this is just the way it's going to be in a land of knockoff remakes, and even remakes of those remakes or \"reimagining\". We MUST support this film. The disease of Social Justice that is spreading across Hollywood was not present here in this film and that is something we should applaud.I didn't feel preached to or lectured by some cult like agenda leaving the theater after watching this and instead I felt happy. An original idea.. I will say again an original idea with sharpshooter delivery by Tarantino and an all star cast. Let's make being a movie star a special thing again. Super hero garbage eat you're heart out. Thank you for making this film!!", "Story less and clueless": "What a boring story less movie it was. I couldn't bare watching it more than one hour. So many people left the theater after one our.", "Mediocre, But Still Better than Most Films Lately": "Better than most films today, but that isn't saying much in superhero and comic book land that is Hollywood today.It was too long and rather pointless, but somehow compelling. Tarantino can do that, make a 3-hour movie that is mostly stupid but it's entertaining. I can't even explain it except the actors are good. It's almost like a magic act in which the Great Tarantino pulls away his cape and three hours have passed. Taa Daaa! Where has the time gone. However, Tarantino's walk down memory lane was mostly way too slow. Had this movie clocked in at the appropriate 90 minutes, I think it would have been greatly improved, but who am I?The golden age of Hollywood? Not really, and definitely not a good time for TV. Sorry Tarantino, The FBI was the worst TV show in history, even as a bored-as-hell kid I couldn't make myself watch it. I'd rather be water-boarded than forced to watch an episode of that TV turd. Now he wants to resurrect the career of Sharon Tate, as he did for Pam Greer (and others).So, it was basically a 3-hour movie to justify a two-minute revenge fantasy about the Manson Family? Over-the-top violence because they are the Manson Family...except before the Sharon Tate murders, they were just stinky hippies so this violence was hardly apt. The Manson cult played the part of the Nazis in this story.", "Like many fairy tales, there is a conflict between the good and the bad": "In addition to feeling like this was made in 1969, it's set in a perfect recreation of Hollywood in that year. In this, careers have highs and lows, sometimes due to circumstance, sometimes due to mistakes made.There's a lot of great stuff here. It is absolutely true that Tarantino continues his self-indulgent streak of recent years, but he does still master the craft. I do find some key choices made to be very frustrating. It wasn't necessary to yet again center the story on straight white men, and their fears of being replaced by other Caucasian dudes. We know Quentin is very capable of focusing on women. He's even been able to tell stories that focus on something is relatable as money problems, rather than merely having them be the lead in a movie that may as well have had a y chromosome star. So why does, what is in part a love letter to Sharon Tate(RIP), present her in such a superficial way? It's an insult to both her memory and to a ridiculously overqualified Margot Robbie(who of course nails it). We see her happy about her films being well received, hanging out with friends and the like. Why is she not given real plot, something to do, granted three dimensions?When she's in this, what we're seeing is basically what it looks like when you close your eyes and focus on a person you're deeply enamored with: there are no flaws. Why not let her go through what the fictitious Rick Dalton(played to hacking, coughing, ranting perfection by DiCaprio) does? That would be more of a tribute. The only real reason that she appears in this, especially as much as she does, is for it to go with the numerous appearances of Manson family members: it inspires a sense of dread in the viewer. As some worried when they first heard this project announced, we spend a lot of time scared we will ultimately be subjected to the director, infamous for plentiful depictions of extreme violence, carefully recreating the grisly murders. I won't give away whether that is what we get or not, and like many things about this, it is polarizing. However, as others have noted, it is deeply misjudged by QT.There is a lot of strong language and bloody, intense gore in this. I recommend this purely to the biggest devotees. 7/10", "A wonderful chance to get to the 60's Hollywood": "Another classic from Tarantino. If one really wants to look at the 60's, this is the best option. Amazing acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. A must watch in the theatres.", "YOU INTELLECTUALS": "Sorry, but this movie was lame. cant remember the last time I fell asleep in a theater. Perhaps the most atrocious and boring character development for the sake of character development ever, sad, Snooty movie making for the sake of snoot. F I want my money back. So disgusted at wasting the time and money its hard to write a review with out just repeating the words 'sucked' and 'avoid' over and over and over and writing artsy snooty crap in between each key stroke convulsion. .", "Multi- leveled - and it works on all of them.": "Being a person of a certain age, I was attracted to the nostalgia of this film - especially knowing QT's ability to capture the kitsch of the 50's and 60's. Not being a QT fan, I bought a ticket with some trepidation, but this film was a surprise. It handles a notorious piece of Hollywood history with creativity and originality and delivers a much appreciated slice of life in 1969. I love that it's a movie with many levels - and it's good on all of them. It's a softer, gentler side of QT, with heroes, and don't we all wish things had really happened this way.", "Caution Ahead": "Now, I have been stoked about this movie since I first heard Tarantino was making a movie based on the Charles Manson murders. My favorite topics in life are Charles Manson, The Beatles, and Brad Pitt. Thus, when I found out the two top billed actors would be appearing in the film, I completely flipped.With such high expectations, I must admit I was supremely disappointed when I saw the first trailer, and watched the movie on opening night. It seems like he had made a crappy buddy comedy, instead of the crime thriller everyone was hoping for. I realized there would be the common Tarantino comedic elements to it, but I didn't assume he would make a mockery of his stars and the Manson murder topic.Upon second viewing, I started seeing the dark sides to the film. I started noticing somewhat of a story behind the story, and I saw the details behind what he was using his actors for. I still cannot say I am completely satisfied with this as a movie, but I must say it definitely has a place among the top crime movies out there. I could literally watch any Brad Pitt, or Tarantino movie for that matter, a hundred times and be completely satisfied with every viewing.A few times after watching this movie have I regarded it as a masterpiece, that would flourish upon the years gained on it, in a similar fashion of Godfather. Maybe we just don't understand the movie yet, and need some time to let it sink in. But I am glad to say I had not sunk back to my first opinion that this movie is garbage.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes course over three days, and is a film about two friends, one a Hollywood television actor and the other a stuntman. The latter, Cliff Booth, serves as a driver for Rick Dalton, the actor. While Rick spends his time mainly filming movies, Cliff Booth spends his time driving around Los Angeles, getting into a lot of predicaments. He somehow finds himself at the Spahn movie ranch after picking up a hippie female hitchhiker (This is the place where the Manson family is living). While this is going on with the two best friends, Sharon Tate, who lives next door to Roman Polanski, spends her days close to her home, visiting the Playboy Mansion for a party one night, and then watching a movie in Westwood. The two completely separate plots eventually meet, when the Charles Manson killers arrive to Sharon Tate's house to commit the horrendous murders. Funnily, they end up at the home of Rick Dalton, and the two friends end up fighting back and defeating the murders. While Cliff ends up in the hospital, Rick is invited to the Sharon Tate house after she consoles him about the violence that took place. Things end happily ever after.Now, there's not much more to say then what I've already said. And yet, the movie goes in deep and there will be dialogue repeated from this movie for ages. The Cliff Booth character is an exceptional one, and though Brad Pitt has aged since the height of his Fight Club days, he still is seen as a cool guy. It's said he even based the character on his own persona and life.We'll see if this movie goes on to become one of the greatest cinematic feats in the modern era. I could go both ways, but it's at least a great addition to the crime thriller genre.8 Stars", "Absolute Masterpiece": "Quentin Tarantino sure doesn't like his hippies! Not your typical Tarantino film, at least for the first 2 hours. DiCaprio and Pitt were over the top. I really found DiCaprio's performance remarkable. Impeccable recreation of the era, the cars, the cigarettes, the music, the Charles Manson piece and the tribute to European and Italian films. Tarantino managed to web all of this together without it feeling obvious or fake (except for the playboy mansion scene which I found too clich\u00c3\u00a9). Quentin Tarantino's best movie yet, a style that has matured.", "Savor the journey, don't worry about the destination": "Quentin Tarantino's 9th film is much less action focused than you would expect.\nThis one's main goal is capturing the 1960's Hollywood era from the perspective of three main characters: a young actress which is well known amongst the Hollywood elite but not so known by the public, a movie star facing the decline of his career and his trust worthy stunt double (who does a lot more for his boss than just performing his stunts).\nAnd in that portrayal, the movie is outstanding. The long scenes following the characters in their mundane moments make this world seem so much more believable.There is a lot of driving through LA, a lot of walking and generally a lot of scenes which the more action oriented people mind find dragging and pointless but without them the characters wouldn't feel so real and authentic, especially considering that they are played by famous actors.\nGreat cinematography.Good soundtrack. Top notch performances from a legendary cast of talented actors.\nThe main complaint would be the lack of character development and of a definitive conclusion.\nOverall an impressively immersive film that will entertain you for its entire length if you are patient and you don't expect for every scene to add up to some grand final showdown.", "Maybe I expected too much?": "Was expecting a spectacular Tarantino movie, instead saw a rambling story which goes on and on without anything interesting happening.\nThe ending is surely spectacular, true to Tarantino movies, but overall it's a dud!", "Bored to death": "I love Tarantino movies almost all of them he made so far. I like the flair of the sixties. I like movies which are not directed in an ordinary way. But I still try to figure out what this was. It was boring, the violence at the end didn't make sense, things were randomly put together, like Bruce Lee giving a nonsense speech and then fights a stuntman. The only actor / role worth watching was Brad Pitt as Cliff, but not worth a movie which is 2 and a half hour long.", "Yeah, no": "This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I have to agree that the only reason it gets high praise is because of QT. It disrespects a tragic event, the dialogue has no meaning whatsoever, and the writing is bad. Its only redeeming qualities are the great acting (albeit with a bad script) and the fact that they used actual footage of Sharon Tate.", "Tarantino's love letter to L.A.": "This movie is an amazing homage to a bygone era of TV/Film. Many believed this would be a movie that focused on the Manson family and it does though briefly. The film is more of a buddy comedy with the events and culture of 1969 a major influence. The set pieces are amazing, the cars, signs, and major landmarks look fantastic. I watched this film when it was theatrically released and recently on blu ray. I really like the vibe of this film especially how it takes it's hard right turn to give you a classic Tarantino move. I've seen a lot of mixed reviews on this film. I've been a fan since the beginning and I actually love this film. I could be biased but just the dialogue and aesthetic drew my attention. It's not Pulp Fiction and it never will be. It's not Kill Bill. It is it's own entity. I recommend you get your own opinion as always and enjoy!", "Good stuff": "Another alternate history entry by Quentin, this one enjoyable throughout. Annakat from American Housewife has a great minor role. I'm waiting for The 14 Fists of McCluskey to hit the theaters.", "Film barely has a plot line": "Very little about the film made sense, Leo's character was the only one that really had any character progression, the film was very boring apart from the last half hour or so, it does not compare to most Tarantino movies.", "Overrated tour through Tarantino's memory of the 60's": "Extremely well crafted and acted. Brad Pitt is excellent in the lead. Not much of a story. More like an overlong rummage through Quentin's hazy memories and favorite TV shows and movies of the era. An incredible achievement in terms of art direction, set design, and costuming, but it all adds up to something that would have made a great short film.", "Constrained Tarantino delivers a sad romantic story": "To begin with, I am not a huge late-stage QT fan. Pulp Fiction is a stunning movie. Reservoir Dogs was taut and original, True Romance (story) was fun, Jackie Brown was well directed.But after Pulp, Tarantino became self-aware, silly, trite, surreal and pompous....laughing at all of you who don't get the point...it is just Pulp Fiction. He delivered a series of nonsensical empty over the top vacuity. The schmucks thought they were in on the joke laughing at Sam Jackson's over acting, all the FU's and N-bombs and the outrageous stomping of Nazis and racists. It was intentionally empty-garbage - Pulp Fiction to entertain a mass of dopes. QT was laughing at you buying it and saying it was genius.But then you get this movie. Instead of a fantasy land of WWII or Slavery, we are in something very real to Tarantino....the Hollywood of films, stars, moguls, wealth, beauty that he obviously immersed himself in for his entire life, from his days as a video store clerk and down on to today.That really constrained his urge to go over the top for the first two hours of this movie. Now, he rammed the music down your throat, over and over with song after song after song from the era...right down to cliched psychedelic music for the Manson girls, etc. Got old. Now, he over did some scenes that showed who Rick Dalton (Leo) was by making entire little 'movies' within his movie, that could have tightened the whole thing up by simply using editing and inference. But all that is forgivable excess relative to his last three films.What we have is a B-list TV star (I thought of Richard Boone as a prototype, or think a Clint Eastwood who never made it out of TV). He had a TV series in the 1950s, by the 1960's he is fading and doing guest star roles as the bad guy in shows like The Green Hornet and The FBI. We see his high points and low points, scene by scene. His buddy is his long time Stunt Double, Cliff, who can't find work any longer because he is an easy going loose cannon that doesn't back down when challenged, and accepts fate as it comes his way.These two guys are trying to figure out what is next in their lives. One sweating it, one shrugging it off. They are in Hollywood and they interface with a horrible piece of reality. Rick lives next door to a big mansion being rented out by Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. (A List Hollywood). Cliff (Pitt), the stunt double, by luck and fate meets a nymphet Manson girl.That is the whole story. Sharon Tate is drop-dead gorgeous, young, happy, stylish. She is on the crest of the Hollywood mountain top, along with Polanski. They party at the Playboy Mansion. The Manson girls are trippy garbage diving hippy chicks. Rick is getting up early to be on set, battling his realization of his fading star and his growing alcoholism. Cliff is just being zen.Tarantino uses his stylish direction to show us 1969. Bruce Lee, Steve McQueen, Joey Heatherton, Stunt coordinators, TV show directors all given nice Tarantino-esqe treatments. The sunsets on Sunset, and the place lights up and life begins. He stays very grounded, funny but not Jokey, never going over the top with anything.Until the End. I will leave it at that. Then everything shallow and ridiculous and wrong with Inglorious, Django, and H8 is called upon again. Where Pulp Fiction was riveting, this is less so...but when it is all over something appears on the screen that saves the whole thing brilliantly. 'Once Upon a time in Hollywood....' And there you have it. Quentin's fantasy is not trite or silly at all. It is a heartfelt bit of love, expressed in a wish that somehow I could have changed the real ending to this.The best acting in this movie is done by the roll players. Pitt cruises along playing the roll he plays most of the time, the Super Cool guy that is capable of knocking you off your feet with one punch if you come at him. Leo stretches at points, and you can see him 'acting'. To me, not his best performance (..as in Django, Tarantino's over the top method does not seem to suit him) Margo Robbie kills it....just about perfect. Every small part is done with care and thoughtfulness.I recommend this one strongly.", "OK BOOMER": "Fudging history, a Hollywood staple, seems out of fashion these days. Enter Quentin Tarantino to expertly and rather romantically rewind to a time few remember, but those who do, will well right up. \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is exactly that: a cinemascopic love letter to summer of '69 L.A. in glorious technicolour.Leonardo DiCaprio (Rick Dalton) and Brad Pitt (Cliff Booth) have never been better as long time lead actor and trusty stunt double, looking at a precarious employment sunset. Rick's smoking strut armour of extravagance, thinked with mid-career panic evident with a slight stutter slip, is a thing of disastrous, fragile beauty, whilst Cliff's down to earth servant with heart of gold and matching fists character, is classic stereotyping. Together they are Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but on the backlots of silly television westerns.Tarantino let's his actors play, while streaming a steady pastiche of golden age Hollywood as the backdrop. The marquees. The cars. The clothes. What a trip!Having the ominous threat of the Manson Family murders looming throughout, \"Hollywood\" carries a cruel tension, creating an unsettling dread from knowledge of history. And though Tarantino brings it, as he always does, in an explosive finale, his tackling of Hollywood history in a truly Hollywood manner is absolutely exquisite.Perfect.hipCRANK", "Like Capote's \"In Cold Blood\", but not....": "If you ever read Capote's \"In Cold Blood\" about the Clutter family murders in '59, you may see how this movie emulates it in part. Capote wrote a historical novel based on real events and kept the results the same, with some embelishment and controversy that still gets argued about today. Tarantino put together a historical novel based on real events but added fictional characters to drive a \"what if\" embelishment, with controversy that will be argued over for decades. I like this movie's play on history as it alters the timeline to something that would have been forgotten rather than infamous. By doing this, he kind of blots out Manson's name, destroys the murders and wipes their act from memory, and plays a comic angle to show how different that night could have been if just one or two persons were different.\nOn the alternate history note, it could be possible that Bruce Lee was more of a dancer than a weapon in this timeline, some songs and movies may have come out earlier, and the Manson family could be more hillbilly than counter cultural. This movie is a fable where facts are altered and a bygone era is detailed in a painstaking manner. In Cold Blood was painstaking too, as it detailed daily life, preludes to the crime, hearsay, and odd snippets from the killers' lives that lent to the meta story. OUATIH does exactly the same thing but in a different medium. The Capote movie that talked about making the book was nowhere near the book, but Tarantino's movie was done with intent to be its best representation of the meta story.\nThe movie has flaws, but it sticks with your mind and gets you to research the real events, songs, movies, and people displayed. So, in that regard, it goes beyond most cinema that can be forgotten after the credits roll.\nAt least that's how I see it as I look back at it over time.", "Psycho": "Among the many references to classic and semi-classic films and tv shows happens in the scenes when Cliff goes to visit George Spahn. When he walks up the stairs it reminded me of Martin Balsam going up the stairs in the house on the hill behind Bates Motel in Hitchcock's Psycho. The music throughout the scenes set in that house with Cliff are also reminiscent of the score in those scenes in Psycho. When Cliff grabs Spahn by the shoulder and turns it reminded me of when Balsam turned what he thought was the Mother of the Anthony Perkins character. and i must say that the ending was perfect . the title is Once upon a time....and yes they lived happily ever after.", "Not your everyday Tarantino film.": "Quentin Tarantino has changed. While I loved Inglorious Basterds (2009) for its alternate history, and Django Unchained (2012) was another strong showing, it seems like he's just getting out of his western phase. For his latest film, Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood (2019), Tarantino seems to have continued his trend of making very long movies but chose to condense his trademark graphic violence down into an intense sequence that only lasts a few minutes at most (like The Hateful Eight (2015)). Perhaps he has matured as a director, but that's what makes this film so jarring compared to his previous work.Anyone familiar with the Tarantino aesthetic knows that he's particularly fond of the pop culture of the '60s and '70s. Consequently, it's interesting to see how real he's made this era feel on the big screen. That being said, some of the \"fake\" movies appearing in this film are shot in a more modern style, which felt off when compared side-by-side to the likes of The Great Escape (1963) or The Wrecking Crew (1968). I will give kudos to the CGI that put Leonardo DiCaprio in these classic scenes, though, as it gave me a double-take. Of course, DiCaprio was a joy to watch as well, and I wonder if Tarantino was channeling some of his feelings into the character.For a film allegedly about the Manson family murders, there's a lot of exposition put down before anything happens. As someone who was only peripherally aware of the details of this heinous act, I kept putting pieces together until the surprise twist ending subverted everything. At least there's a pretty great Chekhov Gun included in the conclusion. This was probably the only thing I found amusing about it (too much shrieking for my taste). In the end, it seems Tarantino had full reign to make the movie he wanted to make, and he certainly made it.Not your everyday Tarantino film, I give Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood 3.5 stars out of 5.", "Another Tarantino Masterpiece": "Slow to start but still enjoyable as the majority of Tarantino films are. Some iconic moments and the last quarter of the film is both hilarious and outstanding. Quality end to a great film.", "Actually closer to the worst": "Someone said this film could have been 4 hours long. It was already meandering and pointless. Kind of an empty story to showcase the early seventies, but that's no basis for a movie. Instead, why not try an interesting story with a point, but also set in the same time period, instead of basically rewriting a historical story, with historically inaccurate bits, and finishing with a pointless, gory ending with no point. Wow, that's funny! Nope, not really.", "The last 10 minutes is good - not worth a watch": "I went to watch the film in the cinema expecting a classic Tarantino film, I was left disappointed and checking my watch to see if the film might finish soon.It's disconnected and confusing. I did consider walking out.", "Disappointing!": "I am in the camp of folks who didn't enjoy this movie. Actually, I left the theater incredibly disappointed. I had excitedly looked forward to this film for a few years. Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio...um, yes!, sign me up! I purchased a ticket as soon as I could for the earliest show and ditched work for it. I was that excited. I didn't even care that I was going to see it without friends. I figured I'd watch it the first time myself and then go with friends to see it again. I was that positive I was going to be blown away.But no, I was so bored! Aaggh! I kept thinking that this couldn't be it. I even entertained thoughts of walking out of the theater. The plot was non existent. It seemed to meander along like a slow little stream of water that suddenly plunged over a massive waterfall at the end.I could tell that the film was lovingly and carefully made. The sets were thorough and captured the time. The actors all acted well. Brad Pitt is a master of his trade. Even though these points were excellent, I was still bored and dejected. I was so thunderstruck at how underwhelmed I was at the end of the movie I sat down next to another couple and asked if they also thought that was a heap of trash. They were kind of startled at my presence and had a noncommittal response.There's been times when after after hearing high praise for a movie I didn't like that I second guessed myself, but nope, not this time. I did give it a 4 though because of the good qualities I mentioned above.", "Might not be for everyone.": "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a trip, filled with Tarantino's trademarks but this time it comes in a subtle way, beautifully delivered by two powerhouse leads with so much flair and talent it's almost overkill, but that's Tarantino for you, he was never one for the easy and predictable.\nWe are treated to a delicious timepiece so rich in details and excitement, the story goes back to the golden days of Hollywood when actors were idols in every sense of the word, the story itself goes down different paths that all link up at the end in a spectacular manner worthy of the Tarantino's violent ways, and boy was it fun to watch.\nThe two leads, Decaprio and Pitt bring unparalleled charisma to the table, I'll tell you this, it is almost impossible to take your eyes off the screen when they're on, they just possess enough to grip you throughout the film, they capture the true old Hollywood charm so perfectly.In all honesty, I truly believe that this film wasn't meant to be explained but rather enjoyed and I did just that, Tarantino with a twist but I like it.", "I can't understand": "This is so bad, just so bad that I ended the movie so confused about how the hell could this have the hype it received, but now I see it, the famous actors and director, and that's it, because the movie it self could be esealy in the garbage. I'm gonna start by saying that this ismore than two hours of nothing, i was hoping that the characters somehow had a connection, but no they are just neighbors, and the last fiftin minutes are blood whiteout any sense, looks like Tarantino didn't know what to do next and decided to put a lot of fak blood in everyone, and that's the movie.", "Likeable but Ultimately Trivial": "I liked the movie since it covered a time and actors I am familiar with.. It was pleasant fun, especially to see Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate and Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen. Part of the reason this movie came out now was that it dovetailed on the 50 years of the Manson Murder \"Anniversary\" which yielded a horrid crop of movies last year. But the main character, Rick Dalton, played by Di Caprio , a fading alcoholic B movie cowboy actor, was unlikable and his travails were boring. But he lived next door to the Tate-Polanski house in LA. But his stunt double side kick and friend-gofer Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt, was great as he honed his laid-back tough-guy persona again.\nBut it had that Inglorious B***erds vibe where real history was altered to make our stars seem cool. Of course, Quentin showed he was great at nailing cowboy movie genre and inserting his actors in classic movies, like putting Rick in a real scene from \"The Great Escape\" in McQueen's place.\nBut ultimately, I felt ho-hum so-what at the end. It was all frosting,albeit good, but no cake.", "Nothing to admire here.": "I love most Quentin Tarentino movies, the style, the dialogues, the camera action and angles, the score. This movie, regardless whether or not QT made it, is nothing, just a bunch of acted scenes, OK the acting is good, but this is not a film, and no it isn't a new genre as others have proposed. It's a bunch of scenes stitched together to make a film. I gave it two stars because of the good acting, otherwise I am very disappointed. An example of Tarentino movies that I really like, in no particular order:\nJackie BrownPulp FictionReservoir DogsAll very different styles, and all absolutely brilliant. This movies has nothing in comparison, and in general. Sorry Quentin, really.", "Self Indulgent nonsense with no story line": "This film is nothing more than a personal project for Tarantino who didn't want to make just one film. His references to other directing techniques and directors in his other films was well placed. They tied in with the story line and made for really interesting and unique viewing, which was most importantly, relevant to the story.Tarantino uses this film as an opportunity to try and heap of directing techniques with the guise of them being part of the story line. The sad truth is that the sections where Leonardo Di Caprio is acting in these different parts has literally nothing to do with any story line in the film. Large sections of completely pointless material. In all honesty, the whole film felt like pointless content. The only real drama to be captured in the film is right at the end and the \"storyline\" is so weak that it would be difficult to say that there was any story line in this film.Numerous characters who added nothing to the film andhuge sections of the film were other films. Leonardo and Brad Pitt are incredibly watchable as is the case with all their films, but this does not make up for what is a truly disastrous film in my opinion.", "Here we go again": "It seems comic book movie fanboys always seem to flood this page to provide fake or unqualified reviews on this masterclass of filmmaking. If you see low ratings please ignore them. They are all nonsense. I'm not going to get in to explaining this film beyond this: DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie, Tarantino. That's it. That's all you need to know if you're a serious and intellectual cinephile. Watch it. Top three all time for Tarantino.", "another disaster": "The story is so so so weak and pointless and it's make fun of Bruce lee and disrespect him neither when he's dead and he's one of the best fighters in the history and Margot robbie was so weak and dont effect in the story at all and the characters was so normal and im blam my self every single time for paying 10$ for this disaster", "You have to accept it . WASTED": "Its just an utter disgrace the sheer amount of potential that was put to waste with this. No matter what perspective you want to take a look at this movie. It is just a waste. I am gutted to write this.", "Tarantino's undying foot fetish.": "Look at all those old vintage cars of the 60's. Look at all those nostalgic billboard ads, lighting fixtures, furniture, street signs, clothing fashion and almost everything down to Freezer Ice crushers, and we have ourselves a heyday of cinematic stimuli loaded with nostalgia for those who can appreciate it. Throw in a story about an actor whose career is on the skids and we are in a for a treat down Hollywood Memory Lane inserted with actors, TV shows, Movie posters and events reminiscent of that era (The end of Hollywood's Golden Age.)Leonardo Decaprio does a terrific job in this role, showing humility, insecurity, toughness and tenacity. He's an actor who's faced with the dire revelation that his career is dwindling. With the help of his sidekick/Stunt Double friend, Brad Pitt, he takes the advice of Hollywood producer, Mr. Shwarsz, (Al Pacino) to embark on a new career of Italian cinema to revive his dying career. With reluctance, he precariously decides to go along with this recommendation and encouragement from his Stunt Double friend.\nWhile I think the plot is threadbare, Tarantino's dedication to set design and getting all the nostalgic markings with meticulous attention to detail is impressive. I had to look real closely to find mistakes and anachronisms. There were only two: This story takes place in 1969. We see a Boeing 747 flying which wasn't put into domestic service until after its Maiden flight in January 1970. The Joe Namath Biker movie, CC & Company, wasn't released until August 1970. These were minor mistakes, but still nice to see.I think the whole backstory to the infamous Manson murders could have been handled differently, if not more interestingly. The story doesn't give us much insight to this weird crime other than to intertwine this story as some gruesome memory. The scene at the Hippie commune could have been altered considerably if not completely omitted from the screenplay and the story wouldn't have suffered. Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth, looking disheveled and every bit his years plays a role he's comfortable in. With his cheesey and squalid dump of an apartment he finds comfort in hanging out with his Pitbull pet. After a hiatus from the public eye, Pitt makes a comeback playing a lowlife Stuntman who happens to be good with his fists. It's as if in order to clinch the deal to be in Tarantino's movie, he has to come off as a badass.Although there are some things I liked about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the movie is just too long. Too much time is wasted in a few superfluous characters and nuances that seem to just drag. I understand that Tarantino has a penchant for giving his audience a taste of nostalgia. But that doesn't always make for an involving plot. And this is where my interest fell short. Since the Manson clan serves as the backstory I was hoping for something perhaps different than what we got: a recreation of the actual events, a fabricated yet interesting twist to what occurred on that infamous and grisly night, or perhaps to serve as a subplot to the main story. But we get none of these. Instead, as we hope that the story will get more interesting once the buildup occurs for the climax, it falls into absurdity and parody. Tarantino just wants to rewrite history in his own twisted fantasy. Quite disappointing. If a director decides to reveal a difficult topic such as this, he should do so with the courageous outlook that people will be impressed and inspired by his vision. But Tarantino cops out and turns it into a ridiculous cartoon fantasy. What a letdown.\nThere are a couple of charming scenes where our hero interacts with a cute child actor. The little girl is the only likable character in the movie. Watching Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate drive around Hollywood Hills all decked out in an open cockpit MGB is cool to watch. The Playboy Mansion scene looks nice even though the random bunnies dancing looks totally choreographed. The Bruce Lee scene is nothing more than a shameless mockery of the late Kung Fu master, Bruce fans need to pass on this. I liked the film's perspective on the business of Hollywood interspersing narration with glimpses of our star's new career trajectory and how he rebounds back into stardom. Even though the story and the manipulation of history is arbitrary and disappointing, it's best to just capture the special moments of nostalgia. And that's what Tarantino does best.", "Strictly on the Q.T.": "Quentin Tarantino movies are one of the few releases that still feel like \"events\" and if this is to be the penultimate film, whilst I enjoyed it - I can't help but feel that there was a better film in this material that this version just didn't quite get too.Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Hollywood actor for whom film parts are drying up and TV guest roles are taking their place. His stunt double, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) has morphed into more of a gopher role as rumours about his past circulate Hollywood. As Rick struggles with his future, his neighbour Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha) is on top of the world, a successful director with a beautiful wife, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) but it is 1969 and Los Angeles's most disturbing family has plans...I liked the film fine. I want to say that up front because I think the rest of this is going to sound like criticisms only but no, it's good. I don't think it's up there with Tarantino's classics, the dialogue is not as snappy, the musical choices are plentiful, but not as iconic. The historical recreation is excellently done, it's all good - but I didn't feel it was great. I could necessarily quantify why until I sat down to think about it once the film was over. Spoilers from here, but I'm going to try and not be that specific. Once the film was finished, I felt that I would have preferred to leave out the Tate/Manson aspect altogether - or at the very least, relegate it to a background event and focus more on a fake biopic of Rick Dalton. He was the character I was interested in. I've seen some criticism that Pitt's Booth is the most engaging character (and there's a chance he murdered his wife) but I felt he had a dog instead of a personality. Dalton though was expertly played by DiCaprio. His career is struggling, and despite his demons, he doesn't take it out on the people he meets - he has time for everyone, tries to help his friends and is a talented actor. I would have preferred the film take me on the rest of his journey - was there a career renaissance or was it back to TV?Alternatively, I'd have like the film to expand another story - Maybe Bruce Lee's - and tell a wider variety of Hollywood stories, taking time from the others.I was disappointed by the ending. Whereas the alternate history was somewhat amusing, it felt like a cheap \"get out\" to end the picture, whereas, though not exactly \"Boogie Nights\" it did flirt with more serious themes. I appreciate it's not the first time that Tarantino has changed history, but with \"Inglorious Basterds\" I never felt there was a thoughtful film there in the first instance.I appreciate that I am nobody to tell Tarantino how to improve his pictures, if nothing else, these are totally his choices as he's one of the few who studios dare not interfere with. I await QT's 10th still", "Fairy Tales ain't what they used to be!": "By 1969, the real Golden Age of Hollywood was long gone, this was a time when the permissive age and hippies were changing films and audience tastes, and not for the better. I can't say I'm a Tarantino fan, but he does have a huge following, but then I'm a guy from an earlier era, Someone once told me how fabulous Pulp Fiction was so I bought the DVD and thought it was the biggest load of rubbish I'd ever seen, this film was at least better, in my old fashioned opinion, had a nice 1960's look to it, spoiled as always by over the top foul language and violence, but did have a handful of nice nostalgic bits in it, my favourite being the 'Hopalong Cassidy' mugs on the shelf, Hoppy was my boyhood hero! Leonardo and Brad were excellent in their roles, almost as good as Brandy. And at the end, avoiding the tragic Sharon Tate murders for an alternative scenario, to me made no sense whatsoever, still, I guess that's Quentin love him or hate him?", "It didn't work for me": "I have 3 remarks about this movie:1. The movie relies on the audience knowing who was Manson and what happened to Sharon Tate. It might be common knowledge in the US but outside of it it's not. Without this knowledge the tension of waiting for a tragedy to happen dissapears.2. The first 2h is a collage of mood setting / world building sequences that don't push the story forward. For the first 2h I wasn't looking how the story will develop but how it will start. I understand that there might be people who will enjoy this (60s yay!) - I didn't.3. When I first watched Pulp Fiction I really was disapointed it ended so fast. With Once Upon ... I was glad it was actually over. To put it simply: I wasn't entertained (and the ending did not compensate the wait for it).", "Shameful": "Is this a what if movie? I think it takes what really happened and cheapens it beyond measure. Those poor people died that night. Didn't the culprits die natural deaths, not violent? Trying to rewrite history now doesn't help the poor people that died that night. I think it's awful.", "The Perfect Nine?": "The ninth film by Quentin Tarantino is immensely entertaining, but that has come to be expected of the incredible director/writer. Many scenes have legitimate humor in them without feeling forced, something many modern movies fail to do. This homage to an amazing era in Hollywood works because Tarantino understands the material. It is obvious that he enjoyed making this film as much as we enjoy watching it! The other biggest strength this film has is it's three leads, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. Rick (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff (Brad Pitt) bounce off of each other so well as characters and there's nothing to dislike about the lovely Margot Robbie's performance as well. It will be interesting to see if this film stands the test of time, but if I was a betting man I'd put my money on it for sure!", "Worst Quentin movie ever": "Quentin is known for fast paced action, meaningful character sketches and plot twists and turns. I am sad to report that this movie storyline is dull, the characters are unrelatable and really do not inspire any charisma and whole story just keeps meandering and dragging throughout.", "Tarantino's Best": "This movie is a masterpiece. Tarantino's movies have never been about the story. They have always been about the atmosphere and having fun. And this movie does it better than any of his other work.The soundtrack is what really carries this movie. It sets the tone and introduces me to a time where I haven't been alive yet. Tarantino's choice of songs is just perfect. He perfectly captures the atmosphere of each scene with some of the most iconic songs from the 60s.The editing is great. It drives the movie forward and it's responsible for many jokes in the movie.The acting is outstanding as well. Brad Pitt gives the best performance of his career and Leo delivers once again. Margot Robbie, Margaret Qualley and Julia Butters are incredibly talented and they all portray very likable characters.And don't forget the amazing cinematography. The car scenes are so well shot. Some of my favorite shots in the history of cinema.Also, the ending was the most fun I've ever had at a theater. Classic Tarantino!", "I can't believe this is even a movie.": "I went into this movie with absolutely no prejudgment at all with my wife, who loves Quentin Tarantino oh, but I was dumbfounded at how bored I was in this movie I couldn't even describe it to you. 2 hours into the movie we walked out because I leaned over to my wife and said babe, I have no clue what is happening this movie it makes no sense oh, and she agreed so we left. if you thought Mary Poppins was a bad movie, you're going to take yourself to A whole New world with how horribly boring end empty this entire movie is.", "Better than expected!": "Well before i saw this i realized that this wasnt really my type of movie but it had a lot of good actors in it so i was like im gonna try to see it. Well now after seeing it i realized a few things. Well here really was no story and there was sometimes too many things happening at once, but it was never confusing, but i dont really mind that as i liked it anyway. Now the best part would be the ending and thats where all the violence happens. The ending was weird but really cool. The acting was great and i really liked everything about it. Since there is really no story but there is some, i liked everything that there was and even basically with no story it still was never boring and was fun to watch the whole time. Some parts and scenes really didn't make no sense and were random but they were still fun to watch nonetheless. I think this movie deserved more awards.", "An apologist tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood.": "Nothing but the best from Tarantino in this mature apologist tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood.", "\"We Happy? We Happy!\"": "For me, this film was another La La Land; the first time I saw it, I didn't like it. However, after going away and thinking about it and eventually returning to it, I thought (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) was really quite good.I wouldn't say that it's Tarantino's best film but I would say that it's possibly 2019's best. The dialogue is simple but hits all the right notes. The stellar cast is, well... \"stellar\". Brad Pitt was the definition of \"cool\" while Margot Robbie managed to capture all of the silent tragedy of the life of Sharon Tate. Even the dog (Brandy) was on top, hippy-chewing form!Personally, I think you've just got to know what you're going in for. This isn't some complex movie trying to tell some spiritual message. This is a story about two fellas going from A to B. It becomes more complicated when you wonder why Tarantino decided to add the Manson element, and I can only conclude that (like my father, who was 18 at the time) he was very affected by them when they happened. Apart from that, this film is very, very simple. Is that a bad thing? In the end, no. Films are often so convoluted these days, so it was nice to see a film that knew what it wanted to achieve and achieved it.Should it have one Best Picture? Yes. No other film this year has entertained me like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I was very disappointed with The Irishman and thought Joker was both grim and unoriginal. I know there are others but for me, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood really stood out for its creativity and its visual poetry. After watching it, you sit back and think: \"why couldn't history have been like that?\"In short, it's a movie made by someone who loves movies and if you want a nostalgic, heartfelt look at the bygone days of 1960s Hollywood, this film is for you!", "Pure Dross": "We only watched this because of the cast and the director, surely it could be so bad...it was worse!No story, self indulgent, utter garbage.Clearly nobody had the balls to say to Tarantino, 'actually this film is a load of rubbish' so he just carried and made it.Do not waste 2.5 hours of your life waiting for this film to start, it never does!", "Amazing. Would definitely recommend": "Ever since the teaser trailer dropped I was hyped. I finally got to see the movie and it's was amazing. Let me start with the good things about this movie. It's feels like a love letter to the 60's movies/series that pays respects to those days. The chemistry between Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Pitt) is extremely entertaining and well written. The soundtrack and cinematography is fantastic + the large amounts of references such as red apple cigarettes. The Ending of the movie is the absolute best part of the movie and cranks up the style that Tarantino is know for up to 11. Unfortunately I felt like there where some flaws but not many. The most significant of them is that I felt that Sharon Tate's character wasn't written that well. I didn't expect for the movie to rewrite history like Inglorious Basterds and I just felt like she was I little pointless overall because nothing happens to her. But it's okay because if she died like in real life it wouldn't feel like a Tarantino movie and she would surely have a bigger role. To end off I gotta say that Brandy (Cliff's Dog) is so cute and badass at the same time. Tarantino really did a nice job with this movie.", "I would accept an apology from Tarantino": "It is the first time that i feel losing time watching literally nothing!! No plots no actions no nothing. Tarantino please quit !", "Worst experience since \"the emoji movie\"": "There there is nothing in this movie that is interesting or fun!! It's even missing the long and well-structured dialogues like inglourious basterds at the beginning, or in the scene at the bar at the basement.... no, this movie doesn't have anything remotely cool like that! and even if at the end he tries to rewrite history...its all for nothing", "TARANTINO-STYLE.": "Not everyone fav films. Slow pace of storyline but ends with a bang, Tarantino-style. A class all on its own.", "Disappointed a wee bit. Not awful": "Honestly the least liked Tarantiono movie I've ever seen :-(. Was so excited to see this movie BECAUSE I've 100% loved his previous films. Was a very big let down, sadly.\nLoved all the characters playing the roles, but the group of us watching was confused 70% of the time. Hope your next film is awesome. Win some, loose some. I'll still watch anything you make \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u0153 Tarantino rocks no matter what!!! He's an amazing person and story teller", "Tarantino's best": "Easily the best Tarantino film I've seen. Why? Missing almost all the Tarantinos trademark ramblings, gore/violence and strange details. Still it had a bit of all of them, but in my opinion with better execution than usually. I know thats why people love his films but they are not for me.Great story (very surprising for me atleast since I knew very little about the Manson murders), mostly perfect casting, masking, soundtrack and sets were awesome. I wouldnt say it was boring at all and especially Leonardo's character was super funny. He should've won an Oscar for the role anyhow.I'd love a prequel or sequel about Cliff and Rick.", "Gotta Know What You SIgned Up For": "People consistently made the mistake of approaching this movie with the idea that it would possess any structural similarities to Tarantino's previous films. It doesn't. Tarantino disclosed numerous times prior to its release that the story was a character development piece, focusing primarily on the relationships between the main characters and their interaction with the setting he created.What makes Tarantino's films so great (including this one) are his abstract approaches to storytelling. Rather than designing a conventional movie plot, with an easy-to-follow story line and an easy-to-identify central themes, his movies are designed in a manner that enabled individualized interpretations.This movie is not intended for the viewer to follow a story, but to enjoy the interaction between strongly constructed characters, and to immerse yourself in the astounding recreation of Woodstock era Hollywood.Too many people are desperate for easy entertainment, when they should be searching for unique methods of storytelling and exploring the possibilities of history.", "Made for Hollywood....": "....that is literally. This, I believe, is one of those movies that will do really well because it's about the field of acting. Every director who does a major movie about acting or Hollywood featuring many actors they can throw in, always seems to do well. I'd say, as a \"user\" of movies, while interesting with a good premise and wonderful ending, some parts were just TOO long--evidenced by the movie being 2 hours and 40 minutes. But, in the end it was a great buddy movie, with excellent acting--and although very long (I noticed people--including myself on occasion, nodding off), the dramatic ending--last 15 minutes or so-- is worth the wait!!!", "Boring and pointless movie": "What all this about? It's really disappointed from QT", "Quentin Tarantino is a fantastic writer and director": "He managed to make the worst movie I watched in my life with three fantastic actors. Well doneThis movie is the best indication that IMDB has sold and is no longer competent when you look at the ratings. If you can, check out the movie and you'll be clear.\nMany firms thought they were irreplaceable, so they no longer exist today. If IMDB continue like this, the same fate awaits them. There are many more viewers than directors, writers and producers.", "Once upon time in Hollywood": "But watch it for Margot's sweet slender legs showcased in a tight mini skirt and boots. SCHWING!!It is Tarantino so you will get surprises and action too. Fear not!", "Great Actors, Terrible Movie": "Very disappointed by this one. 2hrs and 20min of boredom followed by 20 minutes of trying to make up for the first 2hr and 20min being boring and pointless. Bad movie, end of story.", "Even Tarantino can fail": "If I look at the reviews so far I can only imagine that Tarantino always has this bonus that he is who he is. Because this is not a good movie if you look at it objectively.The Story: Well there really is none. It is different fragments but it never really moves anywhere. A lot of the story is watching Brad Pitt drive, watching Dicaprio act in a movie within the movie and margot robbie watching a movie. This is Once Upon a Times biggest problem.The actors: Dicaprio is good as always but he was better in Wolf of Wallstreet and even in another Tarantino movie that was awesome, Django. Brad Pitt as usual is being Brad Pitt. It works but is never suprising. Margot Robbie, well her part is so irrelevant, she is fine though.Dialog: The biggest bummer. We all love the Tarantino quick witted dialog. Well, you won't get them this time. The dialog in this movie is often very dull and flat.Simply put this movie isn't fun. Yes it looks very good, the sets, the camera work that is all fine but thats about it. There is no plot, no outstanding actors performance, no good dialog and on top of that there is at some point a voice over that feels so out of place because it justs pops up at points and is not really needed for anything. I am neither a Tarantino fan nor hater. I liked Inglorius Bastards, Django and Hateful 8 but this movie here is just not good.", "It was good but...": "Like most Quentin Tarantino films, this one follows the same formula. Take a plot, put it in a blender, chop it up, then put unrelated pieces together, until you have enough of a timeline for a full movie. It was strange, with some good lines and good parts of the plot, but also stupid ones, just for effect. By the time an hour had gone by I couldn't wait for it to be over. I don't really understand the Charles Manson and his followers being part of the film either...it was gratuitous to me, and disrespectful to Tate's family. It had zero to do with the plot, and was just thrown in, with a lot of graphic violence to top it off. I do love Leonardo DiCaprio, and look forward to seeing him in a better movie than this mishmash.", "A mediocre flick": "I was not immersed at all in this movie. It's drawn out, boring and feels like Tarantino lost a bet and had to direct this one.If you fell for it, take out the director and the main cast and see if you'd still enjoy it.", "Bunch of characters, no story": "If you expect a coherent story that binds this movie together, to draw you in and make you care, this is not the one for you. All focus is on various characters but there is no substance behind any of them in the bigger picture. It is the opposite situation of most Hollywood movies today I guess, but in the end the result is the same. You just don't care what happens to them. If you like the 70s and just want to see this for the nostalgia, then you will have a good time since there is plenty of that thing.", "How did this movie get ANY good reviews?": "Let's start out by saying that I LOVE Tarantino movies, And every actor in this movie. But this movie was terrible! Kept waiting, and waiting. and waiting. It ended, I looked at all 3 of my friends that I was with, We all started shaking our heads in disbelief. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE WRITING A REVIEW LIKE THIS ON A TARANTINO FILM!", "I though it was good": "I LOVE Quentin Tarantino films such as Kill Bill 1 and 2, Django, Pulp fiction,these are the films that made him be himself. And with Once upon a time in Hollywood I GOT that. If you want a plot in this movie......then this film ain't for you. Because these are some scenes where there was no plot and there were just scenes. You don't get movie like that anymore and it great to see that in a 2019 film. Leonardo DiCaprio was good in the film along with Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate. But the real show stealer WAS Brad Pitt, man was he good in the film. He was just so much fun to watch in the screen and his performance was fantastic. And the last 30 minutes of the film was just so much fun. BUT MY favorite scene was the one where they were making commentary in one of the shows they are watching and they were in. and my god was this scene so damn relatable. Yeah but if there were some few things that bother me in the film, such as his portrayal of Bruce Lee, and the hippies were really........... weird, however these are just nitpicks cause in all reality the film was just a joy to watch. 7/10. You did again Quentin Tarantino", "Waiting and waiting": "I was waiting and waiting for the movie to have some sort of a plot. I was bored for 2 hrs and 41 min. There was no point to the movie. I will say the acting was good. There was a few parts that were funny, but the movie was terrible. The ending was the only good part of the entire thing. Can I have my money back?", "This will go down as Tarantino's worst movie, but he remains and will always be known as a great director": "Don't fall for the critic's numbers, this movie is void of 'Tarantino Dialogue', and has very little action. 2 scenes that total 5-10 minutes of this long movie were close to what we know this genius normally delivers. Pulp Fiction and Django are amazing, this one is so far from those classics it is hard to believe it was made by the same person.", "Once upon a time i was bored": "At the start of the movie i really thought this would get an interesting watch.We had an awesome star double, pretty colourful pictures (almost to golden for its golden age) and wonderful cinematography.Just moments later i started realizing that this was going in the wrong direction.Scenes after scenes full of confusion. No explanation about the happened. Meaningless dialogues, in meaningless scenes, played by meaningless characters.Trying to figure out a story, wasnt possible.\nIt took me about 15-20 mins. to realize that this wont be a pleasure to watch.\nAnd it wasnt.The characters were heavily superficial, i cant understand someone saying there was a bromance between both protagonists, there wasnt even emotion.\nLeo sold his soul, Brad seemed bored and margot couldve been played by everyone else lookalike.Sad part is the potential of this well done art direction (reason for two stars), which was the only reason to not surrender after 30mins.The ending was a shame thinking about the historical background.Tarantinos screenplay is horrific and so is the movie. Do yourself a favor and watch once upon a time in america in preference to this waste of money and time.", "Artsy film that provides good entertainment.": "Let me start this analysis by saying one thing, far too long. This movie is expertly crafted and performed, but this film's length can hamper the pleasure that somebody would get from the experience. Tarantino brings together a magnificent tribute to this era of cinema and truly shows his love for that time. Dicaprio and Pitt perform as normal, stunning on all levels of performance. Of course, the dialogue will pull you into the world that has been created by Tarantino, and I would expect nothing less from Quentin. This film had me thoroughly entertained, providing laughs and solid dramatic elements, throughout most of its length. The payoff at the end of the movie was also worth the wait.On a side note, I'd like to see Tarantino shoot a movie with a much shorter runtime than he produced. It seems as if he's in a 3-hour \"Scorsesse\" mode, but he doesn't provide a story that's interesting enough to captivate an audience for so long.

He's simply just lost it. Like, what're you doing??? His last good movie was Django unchained. He's done. You're done, buddy. I was fun while it lasted...Who does this? Structurally, ok? Basic, how to make a movie 101. Let's just throw that out the window. Look, it's one thing to be influenced by the 60's, but to make a movie as if it came straight out of the 60's? There's a reason nobody in their right mind makes movies like that anymore. It has to do with objective data on what audiences respond to. But screw that. Just do whatever you want, right? Dun du-ruh du-ruh. How slow can you go!! For Christ sakes. Speed it the F up. Let's go. MOVE IT.Let's say for the sake of arguement that the pace was brisker. Even then, it's still... I don't know.

I like a fool bought into the hype and wasted 3 hours of life that I could've spend something more interesting you know like banging my head against a wall. If the purpose of the movie was keep you guessing it fulfilled it's purpose but if that wasn't the case may be Tarantino was trying to prove how fast he can put people to sleep.If You grew up in the 70's you may enjoy the movie as it may make you feel nostalgic but for everyone else this will put you to sleep faster than Zzzquile.", "2 hours of zzzzz for 10 minutes of wtf": "I enjoyed seeing what 60s Hollywood looked like, but that's all we got for 2 hours.

Leo DiCaprio in his most honest role to date, Brad Pitt's best performances since Fight Club, Margot Robbie is wonderful, Julia Butters is going to be a star, and an excellent performance from Margeret Qualley as Pussycat.

Brad Pitt plays the alter ego/ Jimmy Cricket to Dicaprio's fading star. He really doesn't have much to do nor does Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate. Dicaprio a Rick is very good knowing when to draw the line at camp and when to let it go. He gives him dimension- as much as so shallow a person can have. All in all, it's visually nice to look at with some good performances by many young actors - Margaret Qualley for one but its long and one must indulge Tarantino's many quirks.

But in the theater, I got really disappointed & kinda bored. After giving it some thought though, I guess that was just typical QT with less glory & much less good dialogs. The retro theme of the movie was a positive point, alongside the actings. The movie could be shorter, or it could contain a little more interesting scenes & as I said, good dialogs.

This movie has neither of them. It shows a succession of stories, episodes and scenes although with the same characters but dispersed and weakly linked. Those parts may be well acted and directed anyway. The story is about several facts, happenings and events of the lives of a TV actor and his stunt in past century sixties. Not particularly interesting nor thrilling.", "Tarantino in decline": "The movie was disappointing. Too long, the story completely uninspiring and the twist at the end, well that's Hollywood. An excellent cast cannot save the movie, Brad Pitt delivers a great performance, Leo DiCaprio, actually one of the greatest, comes across as really bored and uninspiring. Many scenes with endless meaningless dialogues simply put you to sleep in the cinema. The art direction, cinematography, budget, actors may tell you that a great director is at work but the use of music in the movie is disappointing and the story simply lacks excitement and tense moments. Better go see some of Tarantino's older movies, up and including Inglorious Basterds almost all are great but this one unfortunately not.", "I would actually give this a 6.5 if I could": "I've near enough watched every Tatantino movie, this is the worst that I have seen of his. Not that it is a bad movie, it's well acted, written and directed. It just wasn't particularly entertaining, I'm confused why it is rated so high. Nothing happens of note in this movie until the last 15 minutes. It's like watching a TV series with 2 filler episodes to get to the episode you actually want to see. I'm just so honestly baffled. I'm glad I only bought it when it was on offer and I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to see it, would have been a miserable and tiring experience. This isn't a typical Tarantino movie by any stretch of the imagination. Yeah, I just don't realy know what to say. I don't really think I could possibly suggest this movie to anyone, if you wanna see it then go ahead, just don't expect to have a fun time. It almost feels like an Oscar bait movie? I guess it won a couple anyway but not the ones Tarantino was wanting maybe. Speaking of which, I don't really know why Brad Pitt won an Oscar for this? Don't get me wrong, he is a fantastic actor and he always gives a brilliant performance but this is just another typically brilliant performance from him, it doesn't stand out compared to others. I feel like he should have got one for Fight Club going by this.\nBut yeah, I can't fault it for how it looks, nice looking movie so I understand the Production Design Oscar win.", "Um.....": "What a bizarre movie! I don't really have anything more to say.", "Was this supposed to be a comedy?": "It was laughably bad. Tarantino has officially nuked the fridge, with this silly movie. If it was intended to be a spoof then it's brilliant. Maybe Tarantino was doing his best Tommy Wiseau impersonation, because this is right up there with The Room for unintentional comedy.", "Missing a storyline and character development": "Went to the Film museum cinema to watch the movie on 35mm film. I do like analoge more. It feels easier to watch.This movie has great acting, props, comedy and does not really bore. The problem is that there is no real storyline for 2 hours. There are some clues to what is going to be used and what is going to happen throughout the movie but it feels repetative after 1,5 hours. 10 minutes is how long this movie isn't too mild. Great how in the part with the stuntguy and Pussycat he shows how men should behave when confronted in a situation like that.\nI do not know if putting a 25 year old in the role of a minor that likes older guys was on purpose but it did add a extra layer.Throughout the movie there isn't the level of sexual freedom and use of weed one would expect during that time period in that area. It is very Mild in that way. And i do not know why because the reason this movie is therefore ratwd 16+ comes down to just 10 minutes not suited for people younger.Though as said earlier the first 2 hours felt overall repetitive, chaotic and pointless. This kept me and others from leaving the cinema statisfied.", "Not much to say": "The acting by Pitt, Decaprio, Margot Robbie, and many of the \"hippies\" was really good. The plot, however, was really bad. The story was flat, not suspenseful, and mostly just boring. I generally like QT films, but if his name was not attached, this film would have never been produced. Don't waste your time, just watch Pulp Fiction again.", "What the hell": "Brad Pitt is brilliant in this as are all the actors. I just don't understand that ending. Its bizarre but amazing. Its like the film rolls along at a constant 8/10 then goes to 11 for the last 30 mins.", "Frustrating for 2/3, Fun for 1/3": "To preface this review, I want to express how much I enjoy the respective filmographies of QT, DiCaprio, and Pitt. These three are hilarious, visionary, and explosive in their previous films. QT, for the longest time, was my favorite screenwriter, DiCaprio my favorite performer, and Pitt my favorite Nazi killer. I was palpably excited for this film, wanting to love it before I even bought the ticket.But, this film is a tedious slog; and for one discernible reason: Tarantino's screenplay. Even with DiCaprio and Pitt giving it their all in the performance department, the first two hours of the film are bland, frustrating, and entirely too confusing for what is actually going on. The screenplay is pompous and over reliant on stylistic decisions instead of developing a story. While Tarantino's drooling over classic filmmaking is at first fun, it ultimately rings hollow because the audience realizes they are not watching a story, but instead digesting the remnants of a wet dream driven by 60's nostalgia. For example, there are nearly (what feels like) 45 insert shots of Los Angeles landmarks and restaurant signs, with no purpose other than to say \"Look, here's that place from California, isn't it cool?\" Also frustrating in the same sense is QT's obsession (I guess obsession is the right word) with overlong sequences of characters driving vintage cars. These sequences --dare I even call them sequences-- with the exception of Pitt twice, provide 0 insight into the characters or the story. Every time QT cuts to a car driving I felt like someone was slowly squeezing air out of my lungs. QT expected the stylized filmmaking to carry the film without introducing anything as much as a compelling conflict.The biggest issue I have with the film, to repeat, is the screenplay and it's structure. The film dedicates massive chunks of screentime to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) as an attempt to splatter bits and pieces of tension throughout. QT knows that we know the real-life Tate's tragic ending. He tries to use our knowledge of the Manson murders as a means of heightening a subtextual dramatic irony. While this is good in premise, it is shallow in execution. The portion of film allotted to Tate serves no purpose to Dalton (the main character) nor to the development of Tate herself (imagine an entire storyline where a character does not grow/feel/love/change)-- which entirely frustrates and bores me, the viewer. This choice was deliberate, QT wanted to subvert the audience's expectations for the third act; but a deliberate mess is ultimately still a mess. The macro-editing (as I will call it related to the blocking and pacing of the film) is massively in need of restructuring. The editor of this film should have recognized that absolutely nothing changes in about half the film and got to chopping.Instead of legitimately developing Rick Dalton, he is given shallow characterization and an unempathetic storyline. At the beginning of the film, he comes across as whiny; and, at the end of the film, he still comes across as conceited, self-centered, and whiny. Because of how unrelatable and unlikable Dalton is at the beginning of the film, I was unsure whether to care or not about his development at all. However, I did find the character pretty damn entertaining in about three scenes that are performed expertly by DiCaprio. When he breaks down because of his alcoholism, we are actually given a view into the innards of a compelling character. Outside of these few scenes, I struggled to care about Dalton.The climax, albeit painfully uncentered around Dalton, is a ton of fun. While maybe not original (as a similar thing happens in Inglorious Basterds) the final third is still a blast. The violence is brutally funny and the comedy is hilariously brutal. Pitt delivers a perfectly intoxicated performance and the physical comedy lands perfectly. Despite the valley that is the first two hours, the last 45 is a fiery mountaintop of excitement and classic QT violence.To wrap up my thoughts: DiCaprio and Pitt provide strong performances, Tarantino's gluttonous screenplay should be bled and rebuilt, and the third act is fantastically fun.", "A Bit Humorous, a Bit Surreal, More Than a Bit Entertaining": "The film proposes a couple of \"what ifs\". Hypothetically, what if the Manson killers had decided not to go into the Polanski house on Cielo Drive but instead entered the house next door? And what if inside that house next door there was a rough-and-tumble Hollywood stuntman, proficient at martial arts, who owned a trained attack dog as a pet? And what if his friend, who was just outside in the pool, owned, and was willing to use, a fully operational flamethrower? (I guess all of that qualifies as a spoiler.) Anyway, just rereading that paragraph, I can detect the distinct possibility of dark humor, and entertainment.Before the movie answers those \"what ifs\", it follows the lives of the main characters and develops their personality characteristics. There is the aforementioned stuntman. His friend is a Hollywood actor on the downhill side of his career. And there are the people who, in real life, were actually in the Polanski house that dreadful evening in 1969. Most notably, Sharon Tate. Her life, and [fictional?] persona, in the late 1960s is presented too. And finally, we get a good look at the Manson \"family\" with a visit to their home, the Spahn Ranch.Since I have already concluded that I will have to proclaim this review has a spoiler, I might as well go ahead and state that the movie not only avoids the horrible tragedy of that night but, in fact, goes the other direction and delivers an oddly satisfying comeuppance. At least it was satisfying for me, an over-70 guy who still remembers the news accounts describing the horror of that night, now over 50 years ago.", "The end scene, right?": "Stick with it, if only for the scene with the dog.", "One of the best films of 2019": "One of the best films of 2019. I love Tarantino 's films when you watch his film immediately it becomes clear that he made it. By me so the action of the film is slightly stretched, but the ending is just the best I saw in 2019. When comparing \"Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood \"with the director 's other films you realize that this is not his most outstanding film. But the picture itself seemed so light and bright that it feels like Tarantino was shooting it to relax. Unfortunately my initial expectations have been somewhat overstated, so I can 't call this film the best in 2019.", "Ehhh super boring and disappointing!": "ITS SOOOO BORING!!I'm a huge Tarantino fan! I've loved all of his movies but this one was was worst I've seen. I was falling asleep within the first hour. The movie has no plot and is super confusing! The acting was great and I love the idea of changing the true story of what really happened to a Tarantino version of the story ( like Inglorious Bastards). There were a lot of scenes that probably could have been cut out. The three hour movie definitely could've been cut down to about an hour and a half. It's a shame that 2 great actors finally get to be and a movie together and it was a flop. Maybe I have to give it another chance and rewatch it because I don't understand why people are loving it so much.Manson was only in the film for like 2 min. The Bruce Lee part was enjoyable. Margot Robbie did a phenomenal job but that whole scene where she goes to the theater to watch her own movie, what it what was the purpose of that? They could have written her in the movie much better.\nBrad Pitt was my favorite character. Typical bada** that's super chill and doesn't give a Sh**\nDiCaprio was amazing nailed his character like he always does.The best part is the end. What I was expecting it would be like throughout the film.At the end of the day I left the theater very disappointed. I've been waiting for this film to come out since it was just a rumor.

In that time period, one would die or have their back broken instantly...\nRegardless, kudos to Quentin for making a great movie...\nLong may he continue, as Hollywood needs more movies like this; we all do.", "Not that bad": "A great time consuming movie. I didn't expected such a film like that from Tarantino.", "Not Tarantino at his best": "Great director, great actors, what could go wrong? A top billed A-List cast, and the acting is good, but they don't have a lot to work with. The sets and costumes are great, it's a lavish throwback to the 60s and no mistake. No expense has been spared on this movie. The film for me was far too longwinded and I love all of Tarantinos films, but this one was a major let down. It just fails to deliver anything really dramatic or even remotely exciting, which is what I was hoping for. Until the last 30 minutes, it's a bit if a drag and had it been a directorial debut, I think the movie would have been more harshly criticised. I've watched a lot of movies and whilst I'm by no means a film critic, I get the impression this movie is a labour of love and film that Tarantino wanted to make. It's a story of a fading TV serial actor that has ended up making cameo appearances in other TV Shows and pilots to make ends meat. There's a sub plot that runs alongside the main story and that's the more interesting aspect of the film.\nIf you're going to see this movie and expecting another Pulp Fiction, you'll be disappointed. If you're going to see this movie and expecting Django Unchained, you'll be bitterly disappointed. In my opinion, the movie is a very mediocre, over long, and self indulgent project for the director. I don't think he'll care one bit that some people don't really like it.\nI always judge a movie by this yard stick. Would I want to watch it again and the answer had to be no for this movie", "DICAPRIO RUINED THE MOVIE... or should i say, his character ruined the movie": "Divine, beautiful and utterly enchanting...Quentin Tarantino's back-seat ride through 1960s Hollywood is an explorative but also very passive movie experience.Dipped with just the right amount of charm, Once is infused with cinematic inspiration from beginning to end, but isn't very explicit in its direction.\nThe actor-stuntman story and relationship never created any sense of fluency or co-relation to it's ultimately wondrous fantasy fairy-tale like theme and revelation presented in its ending.What we get is one of the greatest actors of our generation, scream and pout in nearly every scene he is in (like a nagging pup crying for his 2nd Oscar), as QT misleads us with a nervous-breakdown character study, rather than the classic retribution tale it could've, and ended up trying to be.Even if it enchants with a craft made to enrich our souls, Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood lets itself down by taking its world and characters, that easily could've lended to being one of the masterpieces of our time, and bloats it with pointlessly prolonged film-set extravaganzas and a day in the life that's just not worth the trip.The film however is carried by wondrous transition moments, and a third act that poses a breath of fresh air with an unquestionably spellbinding denouement.But when it's all said and done, you leave somewhat shortchanged by a movie that never really reflected a sense of humanity in its funky, atmospheric joy ride. And it certainly not one of QT's most profound works, but it tries...", "Slow for the first 1-2 acts": "SOOOO slow at the start, but once it picks up it's a great movie.", "Was that Tarantino?": "This was the most boring movies I saw in the past couple of years.\nIf it wasn't Tarantino's no one would even bother himself with this movie.\nThe movie is slow does not evolve and does not go any where plot wise. Save yourselves the time! Do not watch it!", "Quentin Tarantino was born on March 27th, 1963": "Quentin Tarantino has had an incredible run during these past 35 years. The big story leading up to the release of this film was, would it be Tarantino's last directorial effort. He has been saying for years that he would be stopping at ten films. So, everybody started wondering, is this his 9th film or 10th film? You think this will be his last? What crazy stuff is he going to do in this film? Is he really leaving? It was those kinds of questions that kept coming up. So, keep that in mind while watching this film. It's possible this is his last directorial credit for a feature length film.Tarantino has tackled a wide range of different genres, in these, approximately, ten films, that he has directed. He's done, the crime films, the westerns, WW2, martial arts films and even dipped into horror a tiny bit. This time he goes to the roots of his own success and tackles the industry he works for, Hollywood. He also uses one of his best story-telling techniques by changing the course of history. He keeps us, the audience, honest with ourselves, by testing us on our own knowledge of our real-life history and once we pass the test, it's the story itself that carries us along. Film is a mirror of real life, as told through artistic interpretation, so with that out of the way, the artist's job is to make a good movie. Mr. Tarantino does not disappoint in this film.This film tells the fictitious story of Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), a hero, cowboy, TV star from the 1950s and 60s, who's feeling his career beginning to wain as we approach the end of the decade. It also is a story about his stuntman, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who acts as Dalton's driver and assistant. Both of their lives are directly influenced by the state of Dalton's career. Eventually, Dalton accepts some film work in Europe, doing spaghetti westerns and that helps keep things going. There are other plot arcs, such as, Booth running into a tribe of local L. A. hippies, who shack up at an old movie studio he used to work at.However, that is not enough story yet. Tarantino had to add that extra twist to really make this a delicious film to see. The year is 1969 and this fictitious duo's lives will eventually cross paths with real-life names, such as, Steve McQueen (Damian Lewis), Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha). The plot intertwines with the horrific, real-life actions taken by followers of the evil madman, Charles Manson. It is this change to history and this blending of realities, that gives this film its ultimate charm.Forget about Tarantino's excellent writing and directing style. Don't worry about the huge cast that saunters through parts of the story. Don't fret about the soundtrack music, art direction, editing or execution of the script. It is all there and it is all great. He will get out of his actors the great performances that he needs for success. What is really impressive about this film, is the trust we have in Tarantino to entertain us to the point, that he can change history. He has earned the respect that film directors look for all their lives.

Although it was quite plotless and just showed parallel storylines, the characters were totally engaging. The film is a nostalgic tribute to the golden age of Hollywood and I loved watching this entertaining trip back in time. The acting, the music, the atmosphere is super awesome and convincing.I wanted to add a little comment on the dog though - pit bulls are demanding dogs and in the hands of inexperienced owners can become really dangerous. People just fall in love with animals they see on films and go out and buy them without properly informing themselves. What is more, that dog had cropped ears, delivering the message that it is ok to chop dog body parts off for purely aesthetic purposes.The film is a work of fiction, but that animal is not. A whole lot of people will now go buy a cute pit bull puppy, snap the ears off and later give it away because they cannot handle it. I just wish movie producers cared.", "We are Family? Man, I sure hope not...": "Hmmm, my review got lost in an alternate reality I think.I remember saying if you are going to watch just ONE \"Once Upon a Time...\" film, I'd head for Anatolia first and foremost.I'm not a big DiCaprio devotee (his best work might have been in \"Gilbert Grape\") there is one scene here, where I thought he was excellent. A scene within a scene, and with a young actress....I wondered why earlier they spent so much time on their meeting, but it was to set up the scene in ransom saloon. Leonardo might have a future in villainy.Pitt gets the juicy fruit of the film, and it seems to be it's part a big payback. Tarantino surely loves his revenge film, and here it seems he's plotted out a doozy for Manson and his minions. Having the hippies come across extra dippy worked for me, I never got off on the glorification of any killers (governmentally sanctioned or homegrown on dusty ol' abandoned ranches, where they didn't shoot horses, they shot film.)While speaking of killing, I'm a little curious if anyone was disgusted by the fantasy finish. It made me wonder if Tarantino was intentionally subversive in saying hey you cheering throngs in this alternate universe, are you just as guilty of bloodlust of the first take deranged back on our Earth? How big is this damned Family anyways?Casting that aside, the film spans some fine Hollywood history, and pains were taken on set and location efforts, along with audio archives. Hey, I listened to KHJ plenty....and the TV promos and commercials feel like a psychotronic treat. If this film is on your hit list then enjoy, if you are on the fence like I was, expect to wind up there after 2.5 hours.", "Worst movie in a long time": "Even very good performances by Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio cannot save this worthless, boring and dreadfully slow movie.Don't waste your time by watching this movie. You miss absolutely nothing.", "amirhoseinahg": "In Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, the audience is faced with virtually no long storytelling, and most of the subplots seem too powerless to suspend and create tension in the viewer.Unfortunately, the film is practically not worthy of attention except for one main character and finally two sub-characters, the protagonist or the antagonist, and it has failed to create the right cinematic characters.Tarantino has often used all the details used in the reconstruction of various places to show the great Hollywood of that time.Rick Dalton's main transformer from a familiar, understandable and merely good character to a great and tangible character, not the screenplay for \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio.", "Very uneven": "Quentin Tarantino is, obviously, one of the most talented and beloved writer directors working today. His movies always draw praise from both critics and audiences alike and every time a new movie of his opens it's an event, almost like a superhero movie for the highbrow crowd. His passion for movies and love of filmmaking are present in every frame of his movies, and he's one of the last true filmmakers, a dying breed in this age of computer generated sets and digital cameras. But, not all his movies are perfect, and this one is a perfect example of that, in what is probably my least favorite movie of his. This movie's sole purpose is to show us what life was like in Hollywood circa 1969. What movies were out, what series were on TV, what people ate, what music they listened to, etc... And don't get me wrong, I usually love this kind of stuff in movies, but when it's done to enhance the story, not as an almost documentary on the life of a washed up actor and his best friend/servant. When Tarantino says it took him five years to write this screenplay I can only wonder why, because it surely wasn't to develop a hell of a story, I think it was more because he didn't know what to do with the setting that he clearly wanted to use for his next movie. And that's a big surprise, because if anything Tarantino is a master on creating great scenes out of nothing, merely relying on dialogue to build tension and great performances to deliver them. His previous movie was a masterclass on that, people building tension for three hours in the same setting. But here there's nothing like that, none of his patented incredible dialogue that was his trademark in all of his previous movies. There's no tension to be found anywhere in this whole movie, and the first two hours are a total drag. The closest we get to that is a visit by the Brad Pitt character to a ranch, but even that scene has a very disappointing and predictable resolution. Having said all that, on a technical level this movie is spotless, though. The cast and performances are all very good, the production design is really incredible, having earned a very well deserved Oscar, and it's very well shot and edited. But that's not what we've come to expect from a Tarantino movie, we watch them for all that and an incredible screenplay full of unforgettable dialogue, and that's sorely missing here. I struggled a bit on how to rate this movie, if all the movie references, all the love in every frame, Pitt and DiCaprio, and mostly if the old fashioned way of making a movie (how I like it, to be honest) was enough for me to recommend it, but I guess not. This is officially the first Tarantino movie I can't recommend.", "Incredibly boring and horrible": "When I saw a trailer for this movie I told my husband I wanted to go watch it. DICAPRIO and Pitt? Sign me up... it would have been our first movie/date night we've seen in theatres in 3 years or more since having a kid. I'm so glad we didn't see it and waste a precious date night. My brother owns this movie and we decided to watch it. The first hour just sucks, there's no other way to put it. The storyline is confusing, bland, meaningless. And it never gets better, it never caught my attention and my husband fell asleep, and he stands by Tarantino (I like Pulp Fiction but I don't get his movies). Sharon Tate at the movie theater watching her own scenes... what was the point of that? And then the ending the girl endlessly screaming in the pool... just ridiculous. I love old Hollywood stories but this was just bad.", "Save your MONEY warning !!": "161 minute ramble from a strung-out has-been. QT's worst to date. More bare-foot close-ups. I can only guess that QT's aim was to show (what's left of his sleepy audience) what a badass Cliff Booth is, by including a totally insulting misrepresentation of the late Bruce Lee. This movie is garbage.", "Showoff": "The movie is good but not great, I like the acting but not the story, Rick Dalton was a good character but not in the way I expected, and also I hated the disrespect that Brad Pitt's character did", "Don't believe the Tarantino worshippers, this is a waste of your time": "I walked into this with high hopes, but after an hour of not engaging me at all, I decided this wasn't what it's being touted out to be. I am a huge fan of Tarantino's work, but let's admit, not every film has to be great. Unfortunately this is one such time. I hear the last hour is good, alas, if the film expects me to sit through two hours of slow, meandering pacing without any tension or development for one hour of magic, then the film has failed it's purpose of grabbing my attention and entertaining me. I'd spend my hard earned cash elsewhere.", "Tarantino with a sense of purpose": "As Quentin Tarantino is in the twilight of his movie making days, he seems to have found a greater sense of purpose in ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, than just his usual over-the-top displays of violence and movies that run too long.He captures the flavor of late 60's Hollywood with music, costumes, scenery, and eccentric characters. Both Dicaprio and Pitt do well in exploring people who are becoming less and less relevant in their professions, and what their dim futures look like.Without giving anything away, Tarantino offers a unique look at the Manson family and their planned killings of Sharon Tate and others in February of 1969.", "Revisionism by flame thrower": "Set in the throes of a bygone era, Quentin Tarantino's 9th and penultimate film is a revisionist fantasy, romanticized in a quintessentially Tarantino way, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as washed up actor Rick Dalton, Brad Pitt as Rick's stunt double Cliff Booth, and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate.His leading man days behind him, Rick's career is on the decline, relegated to playing the heavy on every primetime show needing one. Rick is cranky and pines for the days of old, lashing out at hippies and the changing times when he's not self-flagellating. Cliff has been Rick's longtime stunt double, best friend, and as the result of Rick's numerous DUI's, driver. Cliff is expertly cool as the counterbalance, content with hanging out and having beers at Rick's house in the hills. Rick's neighbours just happen to be Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate, Hollywood up and comers, juxtaposed ever so perfectly for this tale. The dialogue is snappy and the production design masterful in capturing the sights and sounds of late 60's Hollywood. Our interactions with the characters are never dull, whether sitting in on Rick's line reading in his trailer, watching Cliff feed his pitbull, or following Sharon to the Playboy mansion. The film bounces along nicely for two and half hours and then skyrockets when Tarantino's screenplay conceives an alternate ending to the Tate murders, providing our protagonists the chance to rewrite history. The ending has all the markings of a Tarantino reverie and it alone is worth the runtime. Although an entertaining and loving tribute to Old Hollywood, the film is not without it flaws, most of which are in Tarantino's politics, but we don't look to him to be our moral compass. We watch his films because they're fun, and Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is as fun as a flamethrower.", "Why is there no plot? That is what makes a story": "First 2 hours, 5/10. Last 30 mins, 10/10. So overall 6/10.The first 2 hours is really boring. There is no plot. Nothing is happening. It's just 60's nostalgia and considering most people alive today didn't experience the 60's, what is the point? Acting from Pitt, Di Caprio and Robbie are outstanding as always, and of course the cinematography and soundtrack were great too. But I was so bored. There was no story, no character development, no stakes, no drama. Also, wtf is with the dirty feet everywhere?Last 30 mins, classic Tarantino kicks in which I love. 10/10. Didn't really understand the point of the story or the ending overall. Something to do with the Mansons, way before my time, don't know or care about it. Not quite Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained unfortunately. Nice try at something different but it didn't work for me.", "A modern classic that will only get better with age": "The first time I watched Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood I walked out of the cinema not really knowing what I just watched. I was left unsatisfied with the depths of the story and an ending that just seemed off to me. But now, after watching it again for the first time in over two years, I can finally say I get it and look at it as the masterpiece that it is.The story takes place in Hollywood, 1969. We follow around Rick Dalton (Leonardi DiCaprio), an insecure Western actor past his prime, and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), a carefree man, content with life, who may or may not have killed his wife. We see Rick struggling to come to terms with the fact that his career is on the decline and finds some form of solace in drinking whiskey sours every day. To make matters worse, Rick is next-door neighbors with hotshot film director Roman Polanski and his wife, the up-and-coming actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).Most of the story is told in a two-day span in which Rick gets to act as the villain in a television pilot, only to forget his lines and then have a nervous breakdown in his trailer. A clear insight into the frail and unstable mind of a man who cannot make sense of the world around him anymore. Cliff, unable to get a job because of the wife-killing rumors, agrees to fix Rick's antenna and daydreams about the time he kicked Bruce Lee's ass. Here the viewer has a choice, to consider Cliff a reliable narrator or not, any way you choose, the scene is a lot of fun. Later on, Cliff drives around, flirts with a hippie girl named Pussycat, and agrees to drive her back to the infamous Spahn Ranch where the Manson family resides. Has reservations about the intentions of the group, beats up a family member, and returns to pick up Rick. In the meantime, we get one of the most touching scenes in the movie, when Sharon Tate goes to see one of her own pictures in the cinema, with scenes from the actual Sharon Tate. A heartbreaking reminder of the career and life that could have been. Rick and Cliff go to Italy to make spaghetti westerns, return six months later, only to find three of the Manson family members trying to kill them...After watching it the second time I realized the parallels between the three main characters. Rick, the fading movie star, cannot seem to see that the culture and film industry is changing, leaving him a bitter and broken man who lets Cliff, who is just there to have a good time, do the heavy lifting to the point where Cliff does jobs around Rick's house. Rick pretends to be everything that Cliff is. The parallel between actor and stuntman becomes even more obvious at the ending. When Cliff fights off the intruders, only for Rick to get the credits and eventual reward. The fact that Rick's story gets told side-by-side with Sharon Tate's story is meant to show how the two characters are complete opposites from each other. Rick, a cynical actor, having had his best days, and Tate, the bubbly actress on the rise who acts as the heartbeat and life of the film. An allegory of how old Hollywood cannot keep up with the energy and ideas of the American New Wave.The movie works because we know the real-life story of the Manson murders and assume the absolute worse. When Cliff goes to the Spahn Ranch we are uneasy and concerned for his life because we know how dangerous these people are, bringing with it a tension that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. When we see the three Manson family members in front of the houses of Rick and Tate, we fear we already know the ending, but from there the movie takes a turn and succeeds in defying our expectations. A drunken Rick comes out of the house to shout and curse at the family members, giving them enough reasons to kill Rick. Cliff, who is tripping from an acid dripped cigarette, fights them off with his dog in such a bloody fashion it almost seems reminiscent of the actual Manson murders. Rick burns one of them to a crisp with a flamethrower, making the whole scene so absurd as to remind us, that, sadly, this is just fantasy, told with Tarantino's trademark dark humor.Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt excel in this movie, giving life to iconic characters that will become roles by which they will be remembered. Especially DiCaprio, who gives a performance that is very twitchy and uncomfortable, basically playing multiple characters at once, one moment on the brink of a mental breakdown and the next, touched by the words of a child actress. Brad Pitt plays Cliff very cool and as a man who is so comfortable in his own skin, that we cannot help but sympathize with him, even though he may have killed his wife and flirts with underage girls. It helps that these are two of the most beloved actors around because their characters are not good people, this allows for Rick and Cliff to get away with a lot of bad stuff in the eyes of the audience. Margot Robbie also does a stunning performance as Sharon Tate, portraying her as a pure and innocent ray of sunshine, which makes the relief even greater when we realize that Sharon Tate is safe, at least in this movie.Quentin Tarantino does a great job directing this movie. Using Hollywood as the decor and background allow for the well-crafted compositions and bright colors to flourish under the Los Angeles sunlight and nighttime. Presenting us this dreamworld where stars and stories are born. A lot of the movie is just people driving around in their cars, with on the radio the era-defining music of Tarantino's best soundtrack yet. It really is his love letter to Hollywood and cinema, and maybe that is what this is, an ode to the place where fairy tales are told, and this movie allows for Hollywood to rewrite one of its darkest stories and give it a fairy-tale ending.", "Crap Movie": "Too weak plot to back that star studded cast, only good thing about this movie was leo's acting and margot robbie's appearanc. Storyline was too slow.", "Boring, boring, boring...until the last 10 minutes": "I love QT films and don't get me wrong, when you see a cast lineup like this one with such a an inspiring director, you get excited for an epic film!And I was totally bored and not interested. The acting was without a doubt excellent and worthy of awards but there was no plot (or if there was it didn't make sense.) Characters were there that didn't need to be along with 75% of the movie itself. If it wasn't for the random funny bits and cool quick fight scenes, I would've turned it off.And then there's the last 10 minutes of QT action packed scenes we all know and love! I'm giving this a 5/10 purely because I watched the last scene twice as it was really, really good and I love that dog!But overall? I wouldn't watch it again, sorry!", "No no no... 2h 40min that I never will get back...": "What the h3ll happened...? Three stars for acting but the story just sucks. It isn't even funny, especially not when waiting for the Tarantino twist that doesn't appear until the last 10minutes. This was the worst buy of the year and a film that builds up to something but dliveres only a very small fraction of it...", "This movie is confused with its own identity": "It seems as though Tarantino had a finished and edited move. Then trashed it, and pieced together with the deleted scenes.\nI would give it less than zero stars if not for Tarantino's saving grace, a wonderful cast. A common theme with his movies.", "Coolest movie of the year": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the most charismatic and endearing films released this year. While it does not have the overarching influence of Endgame on an international scale, it certainly can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates fantastic acting, outstanding cinematography and the retro 1960s aesthetic.\nIt is true that the film holds a special place for those who are native to Hollywood or Los Angeles, but that should not stop you from viewing this masterpiece whether you are from Australia, Thailand or Japan or anywhere else.\nTarantino's star-studded cast of Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Leonardo DiCaprio, Al Pacino... and many more solidify their places as Hollywood A-listers and legends in a once-in-a-life-time opportunity that remind us why we love watching movies.\nUnlike his previous works, Tarantino avoids including a well-detailed narrative in this film, instead choosing to be in the back-seat and drive the film in absorbing the air and atmosphere of 1960s Hollywood. Its a slow-burn across every corner and is not recommended for the average moviegoer who purely view films that spoon feed the plot.Anyone and everyone is welcome to see this film, It is brilliant, entertaining and is one of Tarantino's finest works.", "As usual Tarantino does not disappoint me personally": "I really enjoyed the movie in all its stages from start to finish, Acting performance, soundtrack, director, story, 1960s decor, everything was so cool. In addition to the high-end dialogues that are a feature of Tarantino. And his clear touch in his good construction of the characters of the film, every character that you see the director clearly\nWhat I'm keeping in mind is the length of the movie with some extra scenes that might make you bored.\nWe are waiting for your next movie with great passion", "Almost walked out": "One of the worst films I've ever seen. The plot was confusing, boring, and didn't really feel much like the great Tarantino movies of the past. Not sure why so many people are impressed with this film, it's far from a masterpiece.", "A complete waste of time": "The last time I was this much disappointed with a movie was when I watched Godfather 3. And after watching this plotless \"whatsoever\", I can only say Godfather 3 is not so bad at all.", "Wasted time": "Not sure what the point of this utterly mundane movie was. The ending was good but the rest? Not sure what the story is supposed to be, the movie is two and a half hours long and that is at least one hour too long.The only saving grace is the acting pair of DiCaprio and Pitt (don't even ask about Margot, what she was doing in the movie is a mystery). Everything else is pointless, I am not even sure why I finished the movie.", "A love letter to cinema!": "1969 is hand delivered to you in a bottle with a twist off cap in this Tarantino drama! Many feelings are felt throughout this film. Happiness, sadness, and suspense! Cinematography is as captivating at the story. Do not sleep on this film.", "A parody": "This film is trying so hard, it becomes impossible to be taken inn by \"the story\". Also, there is no story.How did I just watch 160 minutes of nothing?Tarantino must be too high on himself, because this comes off as a parody of himself.(I wish actors of this calibre would pick stories worth telling, imagine the movies that would be made if they did!)", "Censorship": "Why did IMDB delete my original review?\nI didn't not use profanity at all. It was actually very funny.Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint.", "One For The Male Fans of Tarantino": "Once Upon A Time In HollywoodAs a Tarantino fan a new movie is a treat and this did not disappoint. My gut feel tell me the subject matter lends itself to a more male audience and definitely one for fans of this director, if you are not either of these it may not be for you.A large and rambling story developed that aimed to establish the three clear elements of any Tarantino movie;1, nothing happens without a reason in the movie.\n2, incredible characterisation of the central roles\n3, vast character development within the movie.The acting was brilliant throughout in true method style but only one role had sufficient range on display to even think of nominating for an Oscar and that was Leonardo DiCaprio.The movie itself was flawed as an entity as it is incomplete without a sequel. We had at the end no established motive and no reason, as yet, why this group of actors was singled out for \"retribution\". We also had no conclusion to any character or any redemptive feature. For this reason alone it really cannot be considered for best movie.I would suggest the comprehensive capturing of the atmosphere of that time was a brilliant display of direction and cinematography so their maybe another award here.", "Entertaining, but its not as good as Pulp Fiction.": "I like the Tarantino movies, i had looked forward to this movie since being announced.\nYes it is similarly produced in style as Pulp Fiction, but it was NOT as good as nor anywhere near being \"better'' than Pulp Fiction as so many here are claiming.All that being said, it was good entertainment with solid performances.\nThe downside was the story did drag unnecessarily, and didn't really go anywhere, although thankfully the ending did not go where you expected it to.", "The Wrong House!": "Once Upon A Time. . . In Hollywood (2019) -If you turn up to this film not knowing about the factual storyline that runs alongside Leo and Brad's, then you lose the poignancy of it's ending, BUT if you turn up with a knowledge of the events of the 9th of August 1969, then you'd probably feel a bit put out by the ending, that isn't based in fact at all.I read about the events as I watched the film unfold, so I don't know what to think? I certainly don't believe that the final act was worth the trawl that went before it, especially because of the changes that were made.I don't know if Mr Tarantino was trying to pay homage to the 9th August event in his own way, but it didn't feel appropriate when I found out what really went down.It's also hard to know who some of the characters were, especially all the way over here on the other side of the pond, as nobody is clearly named throughout and once again, you'd have to read up on things to know that those famous people were even featured.It was almost as if he was putting two fingers up to the industry that I thought he loved by disrespecting Hollywood history. And there's a scene with Jackie Chan that shows the actor up, but I thought that Quentin loved his films? And as I've said, the ending doesn't seem to be what Hollywood and the characters/real people deserve, which is obviously my biggest issue with the film.After seeing 'Django Unchained' (2012) for the first time recently, I was quite excited to see something else from Quentin. I tend to find his work a bit hit and miss. I love 'From Dusk Til Dawn' (1996) and 'Kill Bill' (2003) and I can at least see the strength and purpose of 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) and 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992), although they're not really my thing, but I turned 'True Romance' (1993) off after 20 minutes. Also, skimming over the reviews before I even started this one did not bode well, none of them seemed to be praising the film at all.Although I went in to it with an open mind, I soon realised that it was not going to be anywhere near as good as 'Django' or 'Inglourious Basterds' (2009) and the film seemed to transpire exactly as the reviews had all said.It's a bit like a B movie about B movies, but with more modern values. Values like violence and bad language that you couldn't get away with when the film was set.Although I had to wait a long time for the violence to happen and maybe that's what Mr T was trying to achieve? He knew that it's what the audience expects from him and decided to put in lots of opportunities, moments that were ripe for a fight to really start or for something gory to go down, to keep you expectant, or maybe he just didn't think at all, because I was waiting for something to happen and it never really did until about 20 minutes from the end. I actually don't like violence as such, but it's a Tarantino, so surely it's implied? And generally it's what keeps his films moving, so I was bored by the waiting.The way it's filmed was very similar to 'Django', with a treatment that was more traditional and less CGI and Digital, but it really didn't have the story to back it up. It's slow and dull and didn't provide any of the excitement that being on a film set brings, but focused instead on some rather boring antenna fixing and aimless driving around. It also contains some of the campest cowboys I've ever seen.The change with the narration towards the end was also odd because it was inconsistent with the rest of the film and felt as if it was a montage to wrap things up so that the film could be under 3 hours, but he wanted to keep in the long drawn out dramatic shots of the view and so on. It just didn't feel like the rest of the film.I didn't see the point of this one except perhaps what's brought together in the very final moments, by which time my confusion as to the directional choices and adapted story was fully realised.It became more Coen brothers than Tarantino in a lot of ways. I felt like it was more 'Hail Caesar' (2016) or 'Burn After Reading' (2008) in its style than what we have come to expect from Tarantino.I would like to see a film that shows a true representation of what happened, but even that isn't a story that I'm in a rush to see. I probably won't watch this film again though.409.88/1000.", "Good acting and nothing more": "I was about to fall asleep during this film.

The movie can be split into two parts. The first 2 hours of the film is kind of a reminiscence of the late 60s. Good acting, excellent cinematography and, as always with this director, outstanding dialogue. The last half hour of the movie is classic Tarantino.\nAll that said this isn't one of Tarantino's greatest works. The movie is very long and leads to an unsatisfying end.

The most accurate description of this movie by a film critic is that \"IT WAS AS BORING AS A TURTLE ON VALIUM.\" Absolutely accurate. When I see a QT film I am usually enthralled and the time goes by really fast. Watching this movie I just kept looking at my cell phone at the time because it was just dragging on. As a period piece of 1969 Hollywood it works great which is the only reason I gave it a \"7\" rating. As a coherent screenplay I would give it a 5.

I wasn't sure I could bear seeing that story one more time and told him that. Just try, I was told.The beginning and middle are ok; it was interesting enough. I have to admit, I was wondering when the truth of that 1969 summer was going to be told. Tarantino was doing an excellent job of making me fall in love with Sharon Tate. I was kind of holding my breath, not wanting to see what should be coming next.But, the movie is called, \"One Upon A Time...\"The ending did make me cry. I whispered, \"If only, oh...if only...\" as a tear rolled down my cheek. I thanked the person who told me to watch this-emphatically.Those last ten minutes or so.

If you like to watch people driving cars around the city listening to the radio you are in the right place. I didnt enjoy watching Brad Pitt making macaroni and cheese and plopping dog food into a bowl. His character was boring to me. I didnt like the fight with Bruce Lee, that was just ridiculous. At the end, he was tripping on acid yet he was able to fight three people and kill two of them? Earlier, he could barely operate a manual can opener. Leonardo was a sad character and quite depressing to me. Margot Robbie didnt say much in the movie and the movie didn't get into her character deeply. The only redeeming quality to me was the nostalgia factor. Other than that, I was checking my watch every time 10 min hoping the movie would be over soon. I seriously considered asking for a refund.

But why you exaggerate in the finale (after this relaxed rhythm), that remains unintelligible to me. One can argue that is his style, okay.

Even better, they have stood the test of time, \"Death Proof,\" if you will. I'm lukewarm on a few, but on the whole, his directorial catalog is \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.\" He's in my top five, along with The Coen brothers, John Carpenter, Stanley Kubrick, and Martin Scorsese.So does it live up to Tarantino standards?Yes, hands down from a directing and acting context. Tarantino is on most people's top list for a reason. This is a polished movie that would have failed miserably in a lesser director's hands. Pitt and DiCaprio were both at the top of their games, selling a couple of past-their-prime Hollywood cowboys who found themselves in the middle of history.The story is where Once Upon A Time In Hollywood falls short. It's not bad by any means, but it lacks the punch of his best movies. It's more of a fictional documentary than a movie. Pitt and DiCaprio's excellent performances pulled me in, but the story had no traction. As a disclaimer, I'm not a fan of movies about Hollywood. I can't explain why, they just rarely activate my movie enjoyment chemicals.In terms of its place in the Tarantino catalog, it winds up with Jackie Brown, Sin City, and the Grindhouse movies toward the bottom. I like all these movies, just not as well as the rest.What REALLY made me sad was that I would love to see another Tarantino western starring Brad Pitt and DiCaprio. Hateful Eight would be tough to follow up, but it's proof he can succeed in the genre, and we have precious few good westerns these days.Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a good movie, and I recommend it, just don't expect that Tarantino magic.", "Couple of hours wasted": "I could not believe how this piece of show biz self honoring trash went on....and on.....and on.

While it has a big name cast, it suffers from Tarantino being too arrogant to seek proper writers to help with the script. He manages to include his trademark - gratuitous violence against someone who annoys him.", "Why does QT have to change history?": "The Basterds killed Hitler. Now, the actor and stunt double saved Sharon Tate. To me, changing history to such a degree ruins a film. Sharon Tate and her friends were brutally murdered. Tate had her baby cut from her. I was hoping not to see that once I noticed Sharon was a main character, but come on, killing the murderers before they kill? To disrespect Sharon like this in unforgivable.", "\"Once Upon A Time in... Hollywood\"-Tarantino has tried to create an alternate reality according to his perception and wild imagination": "There are two kinds of realities in the world. One reality which we live in, other reality belongs to Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino is a rare breed who works under traditional Hollywood system but always takes an independent route while making films. The novel quality he carries distinguishes him and his creations from the rest. \"Once Upon A Time in Hollywood\" is Tarantino's 9th film starring two stalwarts of our time Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Expectations are always high when a well-known director has a support of talents like DiCaprio and Pitt but when it comes to Tarantino's film then star cast takes the back seat but how Tarantino is going to shock us this time becomes priority whether you are fan of his work or not.His new cinematic piece is a story of a struggling TV actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt) who just exist in Tarantino's cinematic imagination about 1969 tinseltown. What makes reluctantly believable and interesting is their co-existence with the actual Hollywood characters of yesteryear like Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), Roman Polanski and legendary Bruce Lee. The way Tarantino tangles his fictional characters with the real ones it becomes difficult to separate fact from the fiction.Pacing of \"Once Upon A Time.....\" is tediously slow like previous Tarantino films but required to build reasonable backdrop of fictional characters and their connections with the real ones. Once fictional characters find their solid base they all move forward towards such a jaw dropping climax which is the specialty of every Quentin Tarantino's movie. All bizarre and seemingly trivial presence of even actual characters with fictional ones finally creates an alternate ending of real tragedy you have not even imagined but subconsciously assume appropriate. Style of Tarantino's direction is like playing field hockey where eleven different players of same team holding different positions dribbling the ball in all corners of the ground but eventually delivers the ball into goal post with perfection.Analyzing Dicaprio's performance is nothing short of a blasphemy because whatever he does seems immaculate. Brad Pitt with his controlled demeanor looks attractive but his ruthlessness in penultimate stages of the film is jaw dropping and will be remembered for years. Margot Robbie as Roman Polanski's wife Sharon Tate is adorable and presence of her character has a purpose.On the whole, \"Once Upon A Time....\" is not the best Tarantino's movie ever but it is Tarantino's movie. It seems this time he is paying homage to victims of notorious Manson Family Murders and with \"Once Upon A Time in Hollywood\" Tarantino has tried to create an alternate reality according to his perception and wild imagination. Has he succeeded or not? You will have to experience it to know it. In future Tarantino is gearing up to conquer space with his wildest imagination in next Star Trek.", "A love letter to 1969 Hollywood but lacks action.": "Sadly this is more Jackie Brown than Hateful Eight and certainly no Pulp Fiction.While QT creates a hyper-realistic slice of 1969 this is definitely a film that celebrates style over substance.\nIn his desire to recreate the movies of the era, QT has paced this film like Easy Rider, or Taxi Driver.. A long slow build up to a dramatic denouement. But they didn't stretch out over 2 hrs before the action startedBrad Pitt and Leonardo Di Caprio are fine actors and remain utterly watchable through the 160 meandering minutes of this movie. Margot Robbie does a passable turn as Sharon Tate but gets much less screen time than the two leads and her famously tragic story provides some sense of menace in the background of the main story about a down at heel actor (LDC) and his best pal (BP) as they struggle with the downturn in the actors career.There is some snappy dialogue, a few easter eggs for film buffs and some ruminations on the craft of acting but not a huge amount of fizz or sparkle other than that created by the two leads.\nThat said there are some genuinely fun moments (particularly the Bruce Lee as Kato sequence) but there are too many half hours in between where not much happens at all.The denouement when it comes is a little surprising, but the violence is more Tex Avery than Sam Peckinpah which rather undermines the rest of the tone which is very much 'in period'.I'd say this was worth a 6/10 if only for the acting and the 'atmosphere' but not anywhere near QTs finest work.", "The Good-Brad Pitt, Bad-Leornado DiCaprio, The Ugly-Bruce Lee Insult": "Tarantino crosses his line this time when he puts an unnecessary scene to insult a great Fighter, martial artist of all time Bruce Lee. Every time I kept wondering what was the need of that entire squence in the movie? Did it have anything to do with the storyline? No. So what was the point in including that scene, was it just to show Lee as a proudy, roudy character which he was actually not. It was unnecessary and never expected this from a great director like Tarantino. Did he personally didn't like Bruce Lee? This was the ugliest part of the movieLeornado DiCaprio is a talent wasted by the director in this movie, not that I am blaming Leornado for this, I love his acting and hence I solely blame Director for wasting a great legend like Leornado DiCaprio. This along with poor storyline, direction etc were all bad things I found about this movieOnly saving grace of this movie is Brad Pitt whose brilliant acting sails the movie through and saves it in somewat, if you are a die hard Brad Pitt Fan then you can watch it. But otherwise if you are looking for a movie with an overall good storyline, direction and specially keeping in mind that it's coming from director of Inglorious Basterds, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Reservior Dogs, Django Unchained then you are sure to get disappointed.My rating is 2 star just for Brad Pitt and his acting.", "Till The end I was left searching for Story": "Well i get all acting and all cinematography is all great and fine.. .etc blah blah blah.. But where is the story of the Movie ?? I felt blank.. Once upon a time in Hollywood.. But what happened once upon a time in Hollywood ?? Nothing Happened... Thank god i didnt wasted my money for this movie in theater...", "Excrement served in a silver platter.": "I felt this movie was incredibly lazy. Only reason it's famous is because of QT name.I feel this movie is quite equivalent to \u00c2\u00a3700 Gucci black t shirt I saw on a shop last month. It's a black T-shirt, very plain and had Gucci written on it and that's it. I felt the material, tried it. No difference whatsoever over a \u00c2\u00a320 shirt over H&M.I can imagine Harry Potter movie franchise to be successful without Daniel Radcliffe or the director. Because fundamentally the story is wonderful. I can't imagine this movies being successful without QT name. Even Brad Pitt and leonardo di caprio would not even have considered this movie without QT name.", "Thank you QT": "Back to the classics, with Tarantino's touch. A shame the younger generation can't appreciate this, hopefully they will watch again and learn.", "Builds up and up and completely explodes.": "This film is definitely not for everyone. If you come into this movie fully expecting just another Quentin killing movie you will be disappointed but the characters, setting, acting and finale is already enough to give this a watch.Quentin is known for having violence that is bloody and gruesome and his movies are usually filled with a compelling plot that grabs the person watching the film making them want to keep watching to see whats next. That's not here but what is here is great dialogue,fantastic performances from Leonardo Dicaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie.The ending is nothing short of absolutely perfect the comedy throughout this movie is already hilarious but when the flamethrower is shown at the beginning of the movie and then brought at the end it makes the person watching feel connected they point and laugh realizing the entire point of showing the flamethrower was just to show this absolutely fantastic moment. The final night is absolutely the highlight of this movie but everything else including the build up isn't for everyone but is certainly for the avid film watcher.This is a perfect send off for Quentin's movie career even if this may not be the last movie he makes it would be a great ending point if it was. In the end its a perfect love letter to Hollywood and old LA", "Entertaining beginning to end": "Not a great plot but alot of fun at the movies. Entertaining the whole way through. Leo kills it and shows why he's the biggest movie star in the world. Brad was great too. Overall I liked it alot didn't love it but glad I saw it", "Drawn out Tarantino": "Had some interesting cameos and 60s references, Pitt putting in the better performance and delivered the better scenes. Some scenes with DeCaprio dragged like hell and at times it was difficult to stay with this film. One of the better films out at the moment but Pulp Fiction looking like Tarantino peaked back then and hasn't progressed since. 6/10", "I knew Tarantino was medicore, but this was the Icing on the Cake": "Sorry,..Pulp fiction was fun. The vampire movie was weird and Jackie Brown was the begining of the end.....That being said. This movie was a \"spaghetti hollywood drama\" that went NOWHERE. Leo and Pitt did a good job, but c'mooonnnn maaaannnn, how long do you have to ramble. I am a huge fan of David Lynch Hollywood based movies which go nowhere, but at least he has the art and poetry to keep you glued,..this is just the ramblings of an acid-head.Props to the pit bull in the movie, and I really dug Brad Pitt's loyal character.---chl", "So close, yet so far": "Let's start with what the movie does right. It has beautiful cinematography and acting. And I do mean BEAUTIFUL. The camera work is on point, and you really couldn't ask for a better crew to do the job that they were asked to do. Now with that said why did I give it a less then stellar review? Because Tarantino while being a great director wrote a plot that I can only describe as incomplete.Let's break it down, I understand the story between the stuntman and the actor. But what in holy hell was the point of putting Margot Robbie in this movie? I'm being serious, why? She served absolutely no purpose in this movie at all, she did nothing. She took up like 20 minutes of screen time and in those 20 minutes not 1 second was spent on anything even within the realm of possibility of being close to relevant to the plot of the actual movie. The remainder of the time you had Brad and Leo doing there thing, and while it was interesting in its own way to watch it had absolutely nothing to do with Margot.So yea, this was 2 hours and 41 minutes of my life that basically can be summed up by saying you made a movie about a guy who was an actor and tried to stay relevant. He had a buddy, and they lived next to movie director and his main squeeze. Point? There is none. So you get a 4/10 and what do you get that for? 1 for Margot, 1 for Brad, 1 for Leo, and 1 for Great Cinematography. The other 6 is what you would have gotten had there been an actual plot to this movie.P.S. if you're on the fence wondering if this a good movie ask yourself this one very simple question. \"If anyone else released this film would they ever be allowed near a script again?\" The answer is no, no they would not. In fact if anyone else had written this script they would have been thrown out of Hollywood.", "An artistically drawn mess is still a mess.": "I'm glad that so many others liked the film, but it left me cold. It was ponderous and slow moving yet the climax with the expected Tarantino trademark ultra violence felt contrived. It wasn't the actors fault, most weren't given much to do. Not a huge Leo fan but I thought he was very good, and got the fading, self-doubting him star just right. Pitt looked good but that seemed to be his only function.The actor playing Tex Watson did not in any way resemble the real person (and ex HS football player from Texas). Evan Rachel Ward was good in her small part. Other than being a young attractive blonde woman, Margo Robbie doesn't look anything like Sharon Tate (rounded features vs angular features).Otherwise the cinematography was very good but other than the vintage autos used, it didn't really capture the look and feel of the late 60s in Southern California.Without giving anything away, did anyone else wonder if the speech given by the Manson family member, in the car on the fateful night, about violent TV shows of the 50s being responsible for social ills, was QT addressing those who have criticized him for glorifying violence?", "Tarantino flops.": "Slow moving film with uncomfortable pauses, some bad acting (Pitt), and too many scenes riding in the back seat of sport cars. Predictable, not attention grabbing and excruciatingly long. Tarantino missed on this one. Leonardo was good, as was Pussycat.", "Classics Quentin Tarantino!": "I loved it! Perfect cast and told only as Tarantino can do creating great characters. So glad to see Brad Pitt post Angela and recovery doing well.", "A Concept in Search of a Plot": "Somewhere in this boondoggle is the core of a great idea; namely, the idea of a wealthy Western/action hero at the tail end of his career and his stunt double, the man who did all the dirty work to make him famous but who lives a much less glamorous and far more modest lifestyle coming to terms with the end of their relationship. And while the movie does touch on this idea, it's only about 20% of the screen time of this bloated film.Instead, what we get are lengthy scenes that contribute nothing to the central plot and just go on forever. For example, when Brad Pitt drops a hitchhiker at Spahn Ranch and asks to see George Spahn, the scene takes 15 minutes from the time he approaches the door and the time he meets with Spahn. And the scene contributes nothing to the film in any meaningful way.Another scene involves a lengthy scene of Cliff acting in a Western pilot that eats up another 10 minutes. It's extremely well filmed but in the end the length is not justified by the contribution of the scene to the movie.What likely happened is that Tarantino figured if he could shoot enough scenes that he could eventually put them together into a coherent film and he ultimately failed. The film goes nowhere and even the climax is a let down since the dog is the one who takes down most of the villains, not the heroes.There's probably no one better than QT to have made a film about Hollywood's 1960s era however he just seems to have given into his worst impulses of putting his own voice in characters mouths, name checking previous Hollywood players and reciting encyclopedic facts about film history which unfortunately does not add up to a quality film, just a ridiculously long one.", "Very": "In my opinion it was a wasted time.  Sorry for the super actors. If I could ask for my money back on the ticket I would have done it.

Everybody knows the real story of Sharon Tate and that makes some of the thrill in this movie.But let's take this away. Take a look at this without the reality behind this characters. What do we get?\nA story about an alcoholic, has been actor and his driver /stunt double. They drive around LA, we see them at set. All quite funny, but no real development in terms of character or story.\nAnd we have Tate, the neighbour, driving around LA, dancing at a party, watching herself in the theatre. No story at all. And not connected to the Dalton/Booth storyline.\nThe look and feel, the acting, everything is good or great. But the story is not there. Even the violence is not as intense as one would expect from Tarantino (No complaining). I always expected to all hell break loose, but nothing. And Taranto o played with this expectation. But he forgot to write a real story. Only in the end he connects both story lines when he opens the question: What could have happened if the Manson family would have tried to kill the neighbours and not Tate and Co.If he wanted an homage to the 60s Hollywood, he could have left the Manson/Tate thing away completely and wrote a real story for DiCaprio and Pitt. I hope to see them together again in the future.The movie is entertaining in therms of the music and the look and the references to all the old TV shows etc. But in terms of story, this is by far no masterpiece.", "Boring \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a4": "In my point of view this movie is not comedy in first place, it is a boring drama much more than comedy! Yes you will find a very few comedy scenes and i do agree the story is nice but overall this movie not for everyone and it is not deserved over 6/10 rating for me.", "Overrated and not worth your time": "The first 2 hours of this film are sluggish and so slowly paced that getting through each scene was a pain. Brad Pitt does very well with Leo taking his characters inability to act a bit too close to the bone. Margot Robbie is fine as an aesthetic alongside the main cast. Additionally seeing other actors like Al Pacino is always nice.The final 15 minutes when the twist occurs is amazingly stupid, chaotic and fun. The only redeeming part of this film.The main gripe I have with this film is why we focused quite a large amount of time on Sharon Tate. If we wanted a twist for the sake of subverting audience expectations which has nothing to do with Sharon Tate, why focus on her so much? The reason was to give the audience a red herring just so we could have our expectations subverted. But in this case, are we supposed to know the true details of the story or not? What parts of this story are true and false? And if this is not a true story, then we need to be given more information about the characters in the film otherwise it is nonsensical crap.\nWhat were the Manson cult people doing? Was their ONLY motive to go and attempt to kill the hollywood celebrities because they \"saw them on TV murder so we gotta do that too yo\" ??This film has a very thin plot which is held together by great cinematography, acting and (somewhat) amazing directing. If you like all the throwbacks to the \"Golden age of Hollywood\" then sit back and enjoy this meandering mess of madness because you are the target audience.", "A Hollywood Love Declaration": "Screenplay 9/10\nTypical Tarantino dialogues in this movie as expected. It makes you laugh and wonder how many references he did in the movie. The ending also is very well written with an unexpected and an Ah-moment so you get the point of the movie and why it is such slow paced.Direction 10/10\nTarantino outdoes himself with this movie. There are so many sets in the background when Rick and Cliff are driving down the streets which are only seen one or two frames but are having so much work in it. Also the camera work is very good in the movie. You simply feel like being 50 years back in time with Tarantinos Love Declaration to Hollywood.Acting 9/10\nIt is the year of Brad Pitt. With ,,Ad Astra'' and ,,Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood'' he is playing his character very well. I've never seen such a cool guy like Cliff Booth is. In the last scene he is simply hilarious good. Leonardo DiCaprio had the hardest job in portraying an actor who is portraying other roles. And he masters it perfectly. From anger to mourning. From happiness to uncertainty. Margot Robbie is simply ok. She is portraying a good Sharon Tate but does not do anything special I remember after the movie.Soundtrack 8/10 The soundtrack is Tarantino-like unoriginal songs and soundtracks. But exactly that is why the viewer feels back in time. I have heard those songs a month all day long and I'm still not tired of them. I'm just getting in a great mood thinking of the movie and its soundtrack!", "A fairytale indeed": "Though slow at times, and some might not quite understand what the film is trying to accomplish. \"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" is one part send up, one part reinvented history, one part fairytale, and all Quinten Tarantino. The film has great dialogue, a surprising amount of quiet moments, as well as phenomenal performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, this is definitely one film you don't wanna miss.", "Entertaining mostly": "I waited for hours for the plot but it didn't show until the final 15 minutes, however I was thoroughly entertained throughout the film, even when I started to get bored I start laughing again 10 minutes later due to the brilliant dialogue. This was absolutely Brad Pitt's film though, his show-stealing performance was phenomenal, he is the star of ever scene he's in, but DiCaprio was amazing as always of course. Even if you get bored in the first 2 hours of the film, it is worth it to see the incredible ending sequence of the film. During the film I thought this wouldn't be a memorable film, I thought this would be the most forgettable Tarantino film, but I was proved wrong during the final moments. That was honestly one of the best ending sequences I've seen since Pulp Fiction.", "If Only": "If it could only be a true story. I enjoyed this movie and lost myself hoping it was true.

Another home run for Quinton!", "Ugh another 20 bucks down the drain.": "I took a chance because of the 2 stars but in reality I fast forwarded through a lot of it. Only interesting part was when the hippies attacked.", "Massively Overhyped": "I had such high hopes for this film & couldn't wait to go watch it on opening night. Anytime a new Quentin film comes out, it's always an exciting event. And for months, we've been hearing that this film was gonna be about the Manson family murders, which made it even more exciting. But unfortunately, this movie was extremely underwhelming for what we were promised. It felt like a neverending montage of 60's Hollywood tourist stops with endless underdeveloped characters who never get flushed out at all, and a plot that felt very unorganized & never seemed to go anywhere.The film centers primarily around Leonardo DiCaprio's character, a television actor who's trying to transition into Western films after pulling the plug on his successful TV show where he played a Bounty Hunter. Terrified at the idea that he made the wrong career choice & may not have much success in feature films, he unravels into an obscene, drunken mess on his first film. It was an interesting storyline but here's the one major problem: Leo's character is deeply, DEEPLY unlikeable. From the very beginning of the film, he comes across as very snobby & arrogant, which makes it really hard to care about whether or not he ends up finding success as a movie actor.On to Brad Pitt, who is definitely the character favorite for this film. He's DiCaprio's longtime stuntman in this film. The 2 characters have worked together for years & are like brothers. Pitt's character is hilarious & fun. But there was never anything to his character as far as story or conflict or development or anything. He was just there to serve as a sidekick to DiCaprio & kick people's asses for entertainment here & there, other than that there wasn't much to him at all.And finally, the whole subplot regarding Charles Manson & Sharon Tate: this part of the film was pretty much just a footnote. We don't even get to that part of the film until the last half hour, after watching a long, dragged-out film about Leonardo trying to find himself as an actor & Brad Pitt driving all around Hollywood going to different places. Then we finally get the scene with the Manson family. And while the ending is entertaining, I was still pretty disappointed.Of all Quentin's films, I'd say this one is definitely one of the worst. I just expected so much more& felt really underwhelmed by the time it was over.", "Finally, an Uchrony": "The recreation of glamor? Tarantino's childhood Hollywood ends in a hilarious and delusional Uchrony of the crimes of the Manson Family.", "Watch it in two parts for maximum pleasure": "I first tried to watch this movie when it came out, it was 30 mins when I first looked at the time, thinking that at least half of the movie was through, and when I realized I'm only 30 minutes in, I stopped watching because I was bored until then. Yesterday, I've decided to watch it in 2 parts. Day one, 1hr 30min and the next day 1hr 20min. Then, it was much more pleasing and watchable. I recommend you to do so too.", "Only because of Leonardo , Brad and Margot I gave nine out of ten": "Hi, there\nAt first I want to say that when you hear or see the name Quentin Tarantino, you expect a lot. But in this movie my expectations were not fulfilled. Why they try to bring down Bruce Lee's image? He is a person who is no more and his legacy is known all over the world. I do not know why the director decided to malign someone, Who's reputation is as high as Bruce Lee! I previously knew that he respected Bruce Lee in a huge way. If you have seen kill bill you will know what I am saying. The same person did this? I am frustrated. I love Quentin but he could have done it differently. And acting of Leonardo , Brad and Margot were outstanding. You enter to a movie hall keeping in mind these names, you know what to expect. And they delivered it well. All three of them. Expect that Bruce Lee scene everything in the plot is ok.", "An ambitious undertaking.....Let's try not to take it too seriously!": "This film is rather un-Tarantino like in few ways. There is little if any race baiting (didn't hear the N word once) and he pretty much saved the violence for the last twenty minutes.To those detractors who cite the historical inaccuracy, THIS IS FICTION! None of this stuff EVER happened. Once disbelief is suspended, this film turns out to be a very good character study as it pertains to the characters portrayed by Pitt and DeCaprio. They were both excellent. Margot Robbie is more than believable as Sharon Tate, whose tragic story had been transformed into a background story.As far as Sharon Tate's role here; I grew more impressed with the curve ball QT throws at you at the movie's end. Without a spoiler, he turns the night of August 8 1969 into an entertaining \"what if\" scenario. It plays out as somewhat over the top, but it was entertaining nevertheless.QT did a great job recreating the Hollywood of 1969. The radio and TV commercials really augment the period piece. The cars, locales, and venues appear painstakingly constructed. You are IN 1969. Rick Dalton's story could easily been confused with many a \"washed up\" actor at that time. The canon that was Dalton's career is masterfully done via trailers and movie posters.Kudos to the dog who played Brandy. She's a Delaware native and did her home state proud.Get some popcorn, put some Vitalis in your hair, and enjoy this film. It is well done!", "Miss": "QT is usually hit and miss.

If not; don't bother.", "Not a classic Tarantino movie, but extraordinary": "I can say foremost, that it's not a classic Tarantino action package. So, Tarantino action fans might be a bit disappointed for the first part of the movie.\nBut, after all, it is a movie with a extraordinary and original story which soaks you into a, so to say, retro Hollywood scenery. It's sells as an alternative reality in 60s Hollywood scene. The pace and the storytelling is a bit slow at the beginning, but everything points to a culminating ending.\nThe character diversity and their point of views keep your attention occupied throughout the whole movie.\nSo yes, the movie is a bit different, then most movies out there, but I think people either love it very much or are disappointed, since they looked for something else.\nI love it.", "This movie \"story\" could be told in 30 minutes": "Great set, great actors, boring movie. Nothing happens, no surprised, nothing....", "Loved it! One to watch again and again, but..": "I loved this movie, but I think it helps to have a good understanding of the Manson family/Sharon Tate story first. I can see how the storyline might feel lacking of substance if you don't. For me, the expectations of what was to come helped to build the suspense as it went along. And wow! I love the direction it takes towards the end. I hope to see more like this. Controversial, but my fave QT film.", "VERY BIG, VERY SLOW AND UNSATISFYING": "I don't care who you are, and I'm a big fun of Tarantino, but this is a disaster. Yes his genius is present in almost every scene, and some sequences are constructed in a way that very few filmmakers can even see, but the story just isn't there, despite the tragic truths upon which the idea is based.The film is too slow and the only reason I was able to sit through the whole thing was the magnificent acting and the fact that I knew Tarantino was behind it.No way this material justifies 2 and a half hours of film and at the end of the day, very few will remember it.Come to think of it, I can't even comprehend why he didn't make the real story of Tate and her death by Manson's followers. Now that's a film I would love to see ... On a positive note he was only beating around the bush, so maybe this will give someone else the idea to really go for it.", "Engrossing Alternate History of 1969 Hollywood.": "Once Upon a Time is a fictional/ alternate history of 1969 Hollywood, featuring an interesting take on Sharon Tate and 10050 Cielo Drive.I found the movie very imaginative, creative, and quite different.

Watch the show for the ending alone, but the entire movie is genius.", "As the God of gore himself calls it- his latest cinematic project is his \"love letter to L.A.\"": "Prepare to travel back in time with Tarantino's most recent adventure- 'Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood. ' As the God of gore himself calls it- his latest cinematic project is his \"love letter to L.A.\" Experience this multipart narrative and the captivating story behind it while cruising through a wild and dynamic early Hollywood. It is the era of Woodstock (happy 50th anniversary) and breakthrough film stars- such as our own Sharon Tate.Tarantino's hard work from the past 5 years truly paid off with this amazing screenplay- which is certainly deserving of an Academy Award. Everything felt so different than the filmmaker's usual style of screenwriting, but this made it even more appealing and exciting to watch. An intriguing narrative about an actor with an explosive personality (Rick Dalton)- played by Leonardo DiCaprio- and his problematic stunt double, Cliff Booth, portrayed by Brad Pitt.As Dalton's career begins to collapse- and consequently so does Booth's- the two of them start looking for other possible job opportunities. At the same time, a new Hollywood star rises in the industry. The plot is built around the iconic Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) as the enigmatic actress tragically finds herself in the middle of the Charles Manson murders. Even before the film's official premiere at Cannes, the Manson 'family' was confirmed to be a key factor in the story's development.A fiery portrayal of a not-so-stable stuntman- who seems to have had previous confrontations with alcohol and has developed a violent behaviour while working on set, in Rick's absence. Pondering upon his wasted dreams and lost opportunities caused Cliff Booth's temper to rapidly degrade. His rage and troubled past were brilliantly depicted by Brad Pitt, who did not hesitate to maintain his unique charm while playing the character. This was an important personality trait of Booth that made him a bit more relatable to the audience. Pitt's performance was so consistent and strong, pairing him up with Leonardo DiCaprio being one of the best choices for this film. His role as Cliff Booth should definitely get him an Oscar win.DiCaprio makes his glorious return to the big screen 4 years after starring in Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's Award-winning film ('The Revenant')- that got DiCaprio his long-awaited Oscar. His Rick Dalton was complex enough to depict the actor's insanely wide emotional range. Representing one of the main reasons for 'Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood's success, DiCaprio brings his A-game to the film. In my opinion, casting an actor with such big influence as Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing way of attracting younger audiences and introducing them to the Tarantino cinematic universe.His take on Sharon Tate was so dear to our hearts- configuring her as an almost angelic presence who guarded over the acclaimed director's Hollywood tale. The script could have had more scenes featuring Margot Robbie's Tate, because I believed everyone would have liked to learn more about the late actress' tragic destiny.The stunning editing and directing mixed beautifully together, resulting in an outstanding feature of the film. The best sequence was the one where all the club and restaurant signs lit up at the same time, as if they were pumping life into an already vibrant L.A. Another unique detail about 'Once upon a Time in... Hollywood' was featuring scenes from Sharon Tate's last films. A pleasant surprise was represented by Austin Butler's portrayal of Tex (part of the Manson 'family') who delivered a nice performance that made him seem very professional.The soundtrack was so carefully chosen, with songs like Roy Head and The Traits' \"Treat Her Right\", Paul Revere & The Raiders' numerous hits and \"Twelve Thirty\" by The Mamas & The Papas to pump up the atmosphere (the song present in the Manson 'family's arrival sequence). The production design was absolutely brilliant considering the accuracy of all the vintage decorations used on the western film sets. The production design crew is so deserving of that Academy Award!At first, I thought a different ending would have been more impactful, but it wasn't much later until I realised how easily this alternate ending blended in the story. Lastly, my prediction would be that 'Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood' is going to take the Oscars by storm, winning at least 4 Academy Awards- in categories like Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Brad Pitt).", "I wish i could watch it for the first time again!": "My favorite Tarantino movie so far, it was a whole experience! Escapism to another era at it's finest. Some people don't know how to appreciate something different I guess. I find this another masterpiece.", "Hollywood dream": "To truly enjoy Tarantino's films, you need a certain cultural background: a love of Polanski's films and Sergio Leone's westerns; love of Mamas and Papas music and all the films with DiCaprio, starting with the movie \"What Gilbert Grape Eats\"? And the story of Manson should also be in your background - to get real, real, real pleasure from the final scenes! Thank you Tarantino! Ten minutes of happiness when you believe that everything can be so and not otherwise. And Brad Pitt is just incredible here! I will cross my fingers so that Oscar goes to him!))", "Not everyone's cup of tea": "This movie was rather disappointing. Star actors, best movie director, great depiction of 60's style, good music but still the movie was a lackluster.The movie has not plot, no goal to reach, things don't really develop and nothing really happens. Yeah finally in the last 20 mins something happens but even that was too gory even if slightly shocking to my taste.I feel like I should give better rating to such a fantastic film director but even 6 is too much if I am totally honest. It is not a bad film per se but it just does not have the soul like his other films have.", "Real test of patience": "The movie was not at all enjoyable. There are lots of events but everything was lagging and lagging.Lots of scenes where people simply roam around in cars, making meaningless conversations, use of narrations when the flow of the story was lost and a chaotic ending. Margot's character was very small and not even relevant to the plot. The movie clearly doesn't live up to the hype. Really struggled to complete the movie.", "snooze fest": "Tarantino has become iconic and actors salivate to play a role in his films, however he has not transcended beyond the guttural, gratuitous violence and shock factor that put him on the cinematic map. 'Once upon a time in hollywood' is a snooze fest wrapped as a love story to glory days. The payoff in the last 20 mins was anti-climatic. None of the characters were memorable, rather washouts and full of self doubt. The biggest proof that this was a weak installment is the fact that not a single meme has entered popular culture from this film, unlike Tarantino's other works. Similar to 'The Last Jedi', the critics are falling over themselves to praise his snooze fest, out of FOMO than anything else. If Tarantino intends to end at film 10, he better knock it out of the park, otherwise unlike Michael Jordan, he will leave too late.", "Feels like it was written in 5 minutes.": "After watching this I thought I'd like to see Leo and Brad make a movie together with more story and why did I pay to see Margot Robbie briefly watch a movie? I get the sense Tarantino had the chance to put Di caprio and Pitt in the same film and needed to throw a script together asap before they signed on to other projects. I enjoyed it, I'd watch it again but only if it was on tv I wouldn't buy it (unless it was in some sort of QT box set)", "Excellent Direction, Poor (no) story": "It is the usual high quality production, direction and quirkiness (if its not a word then it should be) that we know and love from Tarantino. Oozes class and nostalgia. Wonderfully acted by a top line up across the board.But ....... i felt i was waiting for a story to start the whole movie and nothing really ever happened. (Other than one scene .... you know which one). Just felt disappointingly weak compared to his other films which pains me to say given that i am a huge fan of all of his other films.", "Wow, did I really go see this?": "One of the worst movies I have watched in a few years. No plot. Nothing happened. You wish and hope something would happen because of Leo and Brad, but then again, nothing happens.I wouldn't recommend watching this in a movie theater. Maybe at home on a rainy day and you are suffering from insomnia...cause let me tell you, it will put you to sleep.", "Zzzzzzzz . . . .": "The movie was too long and didn't get good until the end", "A classic tarantino film. Lots of fun.": "I drank a large coca cola before this movie started and about halfway through, I had to use the bathroom perhaps more urgently than ever before in my life. The movie was good enough that I stayed in the theater and held it in till the end. My kidneys weren't laughing during this movie but I sure was. 8/10, was a blast and I'll probably go see it again this week", "I just don't even know.": "Anybody else seen this film and just doesn't understand what the aim was? I don't know if it's QT being a genius and me not seeing it, but I love his other 8 movies. This is the lowest ranked one for me by far. People seemed to dislike Hateful Eight and love this which for me makes no sense. Hateful Eight was 2 hours of dialogue leading up to an epic final 40 minute. Once upon a time in Hollywood was 2 hours of dialogue from films within films, with the final \"chapter\" just being underwhelming, tame and just left me feeling absolutely nothing for any of the characters. I unfortunately consider this to be a huge blip from QT, but saying that this is his least decent film says a lot about him. As it wasn't a bad film, just wasn't what you'd expect from a QT film, and also not what you'd expect with this cast.", "QT well!!!!": "Was so excited to go & see this movie , as aQT & such brilliant actors..\n2 hours 41mins of my life i will never get back ..Pulp Fiction my fav of QT films..this is boring film looks like they had great time making it .but didnt think about the audience..such a shame could have been so good", "TARANTINO CREATES A NEW UNIVERSE": "Even lots of people say that this movie has some tempo problems and it becomes boring, I don't think like that. I really enjoyed almost every minute of Tarantino's latest journey. I did know Sharon Tate's story before watching the movie. So, I just waited her death during last part. And I totally surprised! This film's name is \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" and we are watching an alternative version of our reality with a happy ending. Just like a fairytale! Cast made an amazing job just like everybody expected. Story did satisfied me and I liked main characters' adventure.", "Definitely not one of Tarantino's best": "Slow movie, with especially very slow middle part that was not very engaging. As a non-American viewer under the age of 40, I bet I missed many hints at historical facts and characters. Without DiCaprio and Pitt, this movie would have rated much lower than it does now. The final scene is maybe the only really good one in the movie.", "A different experience for those that didn't know the history of Sharon Tate": "To start this, I would like to say that I am not American. I have heard of the name Charles Manson and knew that he was a cult leader but that was it. Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Spahn Ranch. These are all unfamiliar names to me. When I was watching the movie, not once did I make the connection that the \"Charlie\" they were referring to was Charles Manson. My sister who watched the movie with me called the ranch hippies the Coachella Cult which I thought was quite befitting. Precisely because of my unfamiliarity with the history of Charles Manson and Sharon Tate, my experience with the movie was significantly different from those that did.For me, the movie was surrounding the has-been actor Rick Dalton and his best friend Cliff Booth. They are the focus and that's where the plot was. Up until I finished the movie and read about it, I was frankly confused about why the storyline of Sharon Tate existed in the movie. Her scenes were plotless and because of my unfamiliarity, I thought she added little to the story. I was convinced that hers and Polanski's existence was simply to juxtapose Rick and that the storyline would have been fine without her. Not knowing the history, I wasn't aware that the movie was proposing an alternative reality.Yet, precisely because I didn't know, I didn't make assumptions. For those that are familiar with what happened, they expected the climax to be the murder of Sharon Tate and her guests by the Manson family. This reminded me of Quentin Tarantino's other movie, Inglorious Basterds. When I was watching it, I was so sure that the US soldiers were going to fail because after all, we know how WW2 ended and that was not it. More often than not, we make assumptions about the ending of the movie because we have the benefit of hindsight of knowing history. Yet, Quentin Tarantino has proven time after time that movies do not need to follow the law of time. And because of my not knowing, I had a fresh view of the movie with no expectations of where it had to go and made no assumptions where it was to go.", "Had it not been for the actors it would be 0": "This movie was so bad. No plot no storyline. Nothing happened. Only thing that stopped me walking out was Brad Pitt and LDC.", "Way better than expected.": "I watch most of Tarantino's movies, but only enjoy a few. I find them quite pretentious and filled with inane dialouge and campy effects that turns a decent movie into a bloated snooze fest.I started this movie not really knowing what it was about, and I'm glad I did. I feel like if I'd read all of the articles and reviews, it would've taken the element of surprise out of it.I really enjoyed how this film intertwined real characters/events with the fictional characters. I loved seeing the portrayals of Tate, McQueen, Phillips, Lee and others. There was a sense of dread knowing what happened to Sharon, so the twist at the end was great. I do think this movie would be better with about 30 minutes shaved off, would be easy to do. But still enjoyed it more than I thought I would.", "Absolute Trash": "Sure some great actors, acting, dialogue and 60's retro but don't waste your time with this. It's boring, dull and next to plotless. You spend the first 2 and a bit hours waiting for it to start and then a bit of action and it ends. Do yourself a favour fast forward to the last 15 minutes or better still watch something else.", "Entertaining, extremely well acted portrait of 60s Hollywood!": "Tarantino loves movies. So of course he had to make a movie about movies. And he succeeded. He casted two actors hems worked with previously, Leo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, and they were outstanding. And, because it's Tarantino, the soundtrack is fun too! It sets the scenes, which are chock-full of vibrant 60s movie town imagery! The ending scene is hilarious, with a drugged-out stunt double reacting with laughter to be confronted by murderers Tne things get Tarantino-y. Very Tarantino-y. A flamethrower is involved.", "Meaningless plot": "I particularly hated the Bruce Lee scene. It was pointless and seemed like QT had some kind of grudge against him so he had to add that scene to make fun of Bruce Lee.", "A big surprise. Nothing special. :-(": "Well if you miss this the world will still be spinning around.\nEven after weeks I got no answer to: Why.. why did he do this?? Tarantino can do so much better !!!!!!!! The last 15 min is why I rated 5 and not 4. Whis the hottest chick on earth and pitt and di Caprio it was disappointing. I expected mich more.", "Dammit... I knew we should've watched The Lion King": "Boring. Granted, it was a tribute to old Hollywood, which was interesting at most. Best part was the last 20 minutes.", "Wonderful surprisingly happy film": "A pleasant surprise. Wonderfully acted and featuring likeable believable characters, full of genuine humor and a truly wild, insane and hilarious climax. DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie were all excellent. Not a plot- driven movie so much as some of his others but it doesn't matter, as there's more than enough going on to hold your attention. Visually stunning, he captured 1969 Hollywood to a tee.", "I can sum up this movie in two words.": "I can sum up this entire 3h of movie, its intentions, its goals, its motivations, everything in two simple words:\n\"Ok Boomer\".This movie and its raving reviews are proof of what I will never tire of pointing out to people affected by it: \"Nostalgia is a poison for objectivity, if not even a straight up mental disease\".It's like Tarantino saw Forrest Gump and thought he could do better by making it entirely about a specific part of Hollywood's History.But he didn't, it's boring, and there's none of that classic Tarantino dialogue to salvage the uninteresting subject matter.Anyone else would've made the exact same movie, it would've been forgotten in a week.", "A movie without a story .": "Wow 8.1 :) i guess only Tarantino's family has voted", "Somewhere between amazing and terrible.": "It's hard to get my thoughts together about this film; It's interesting in the way that it plays with the idea of what a film and plot can be. Many people are writing that it's just a senseless collection of vaguely related scenes and characters.... But that is undoubtedly the point. Only a expercenied and well loved director would be allowed to make a movie like this and I'm glad such experiements do occasionally get to see the light of day.But can a film still be entertaining and relatable without a coherent plot? Once Upon a Time manages to do this to some extent but I'd be lying if I said I was glued to the screen the whole way through. I'm giving the film 7 stars, mostly for it's refreshing unorthodoxy (even for an already unorthodox director). I see very few mixed reviews; almost all are either either extremely positive or negative. It seems that the people who are giving it overwhelmingly positive reviews are being a bit disingenuous and overlooking the film's extremely slow pacing and non-existent plot, while those that are trashing it are missing the point entirely.Anyways, just my two cents... Definitely a movie that makes you want to write a review!", "ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD (2019) - 17/01/2020": "Third rewatch since release and it's still as fun as ever, the pacing felt slower in the first and second act because I started it late and I was the only one awake watching it but other than that, I had a blast.

A truly great \"what if?\" tale with the best of Quentin, Brad and Leonardo. Tarantino scores again.Mitchell Bulfin", "Not a huge Tarrantino fan but this was passable.": "Along with being a what if story, its also a story about the changing of the guard. DiCaprio is a fading star and he runs into a couple of the new breed.

I guess that's how I got enchanted.\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is the new height in Quentin Tarantino's career. Compared with his early works, this one's rhythm is as slow as a hot summer day in LA. For about three hours, you travel back in time to absorb the atmosphere of late-'60s Hollywood. It is crafted with such professionalism that you completely lose yourself in that world and become one with it. What an experience.Despite its slow pace, it is probably the most multilayered Tarantino movie. In addition to the main historical plotline, it beautifully explores such topics as the life of an American actor, the clash of old and new, true friendship and much more.Tarantino is the most famous cinema geek. And, as always with his films, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a collage. You'll see many references to old movies and TV shows, but this time not only stylistically but also up front. He's definitely got lots of cinema critics puzzled and not exactly knowing where he dug this stuff out from. The good thing is, you don't really need to know. But you will hear distant cinematic echoes from your childhood, another magical part of the experience.Tarantino is one of the few artists whose movies can't be cheapened by rating them. When his new work is out, you just go and enjoy it. There are no bad Tarantino movies, just as there are no bad seas or bad clouds-his works are an integral part of our cultural existence. After \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Pulp Fiction,\" \"Kill Bill,\" and the original script for \"Natural Born Killers,\" he has secured a firm spot in the pantheon of the greatest.It's important to see it. Not because I'm a fan trying to support one of my favourite directors. Not because I am trying to sound like a movie connoisseur. You gotta see it because Tarantino deserves it. Way more than the \"Avengers\" movies do. And, even more important, we all deserve it. We deserve great movies, at least once in a while, as they become a rare luxury.", "Great performance by DiCaprio": "I started off with 7 and added a 8th star for originality. \"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" is unique like most of Tarantino's work. O-Hollywood seems to lack dramatic direction and theme. Several intertwined storylines merge with no true justification of merging historic events into the finale. However, the movie truly shines in each individual scene- you are almost watching several short films as the characters traverse the entire film. The transition to each of these scene blocks is so seamless that you are already I the middle of it before you know that it happened 5 minutes ago. Leo DiCaprio will surely be nominated for one of the best performances put to film.", "Best part Belinda the dog.": "Man what a good looking pitty Brad have for his dog. And man can he fight. Made for the best part of the movie. Oh Brad and Leo and the rest do a killer job but the dog steal the movie.", "What's Up with the Feet Up?": "Alrighty then. I've noticed something I'm having trouble with. In Inglorious Bastards, Quinten had Diane Kruger's feet up close and mid field of vision in the frame. And in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Quinten has Sharon Tate prop her feet up in the middle of the theater scene. Then the hippie girl riding in Cliff Booth's car props her feet up on the windshield, twice. At the Spahn ranch, the hippies are sitting around the tv with their feet up and in the middle of the screen. Feet again in Cliff's fight scene with hippie. So I guess I am wondering what's up with the feet. I mean besides having the feet up. Rick Dalton's feet up on raft in the pool, too.\nI have a theory. The feet imagery has a rhetorical device purpose. Feet on the ground would symbolize an observable truth. Feet in the air symbolizes a contrario , or opposite to reality, or parody.\nIf only this story had actually happened, the Manson murders of Sharon Tate and others would not have happened. Who knew that in reality, a bunch of disgruntled dropouts could have wreaked so much havoc on so much human potential. I would have preferred that Quintin's version had been the reality.", "Superb.": "Tarantino scores. Brad and Leo are at the top of their game.Thank you For not slaughtering Sharon Tate in the flick. Much better story watching the Mansfield morons get munched on and fried", "Slooow , until....": "God dam it , at the intrusion scene I was screaming from joy!!!!\nI was punching at the air the goddamn hippies my self!!!\nLast time I was doing that in a cinema I was a kid , back to 1985 in Rocky IV .\nOh man! What a joy!!\nThank you mr Tarantino!!!", "BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER WATCHED": "Well this movie is pretty nice especially it's ending. Also this movie takes you 1960s Hollywood . The environment , costumes , cars and how people really enjoyed at that time. Even an actor best friend isn't an big Hollywood star it is his own stunt man you can say. Everyone watch movie because of its story but this movie is different because this has no story . That's make this movie very unique. MUST WATCH !!", "Beautifully shot and acted, but something's missing": "This film is masterfully shot, and everyone gives an amazing performance, above and beyond expectations. The runtime passed in the blink of an eye, and while that speaks for the enjoyable experience you'll have as a viewer, that also means the end credits were somewhat unexpected.Tarantino does not disappoint with the direction or production, but something's missing. The great big denouement feels unusually abrupt and civilized. There are plenty of punches thrown, but none of the protagonists ever seem to be in any real danger. I'm not one for gritty gore, but I expected them to go on more of a life-changing journey. Maybe in the final scene, the antagonists are unable to portray the degree of threat and menace that would push it the extra mile, but that's just my guess.Still an entertaining way to spend 2 hours and 30 minutes.", "Fine, but...": "Great movie, but not for everyone. And only for those who know what happened in 1969, including in Hollywood. Otherwise, you will not understand much. DiCaprio's a super-top, as usual. The level of Oscar. Pay attention to the dog Brad Pitt.", "A Hollywood documentary": "There's not a real storyline or plot. Kind of entertaining to watch because of the amazing atmosphere and photography of Hollywood and the late 60s. The film delivers on that aspect and really immerses you in a different era. However the lack of suspense makes the movie pretty dull. Some dialogues are interesting but the narrative is not very convincing. Different references and stories stitched together with no apparent reason. Could be done in one hour less. I found it very tiring. Only for cinephiles, Tarantino fans, or 60s nostalgics.", "Did I miss a plot?": "I really really really wanted to like this movie until about 3/4 of the way through. Then I thought..What is the point of pretending? This movie has a plot that could be wrapped up in 30 minutes but could understandably be told in 90 minutes. Why did they need close to 3 hours? To bore the pants off everyone unless you like to watch great actors perform about nothing. Dont get me wrong...The acting was amazing by everyone. Too bad they didnt have a story to tell. It could have been really good otherwise. They didnt even need DiCaprio the majority of the movie. Brad Pitt had all the meat and potatoes of the story. Too much film was used off the cutting floor which is where it should have stayed. Too bad because i wanted to love it too.", "Tarantino created an alternate reality, gave me goosebumps, great film, deep ending...": "I've been wanting to watch this film, but for some reason it took me almost a year to watch it! Life just has its ways sometimes...Well, I LOVED IT! It was everything I hoped for and more... Listen, I can go on and on about the retro cinematography, the amazing acting, the deep dialogue, everything Tarantino (which we all know it was beautiful and on point), BUT what I need to talk about is the goosebumps I got from the ending... What Quentin did was, he created a parallel universe, an alternate reality where Sharon Tate and the others survived. The evil of that night never graced their presence...The birds-eye view scene of the group coming out of the house to meet Rick Dalton, Sharon greets him with a welcoming hug, it warmed me in a way I can't explain... I think it was a big part of the movie that most of you missed!He brought those people back to life, the people that deserved to live and he brutally snuffed out the people that deserved to die.\nThis is what we wish would have happened...", "Tarantino's Amazing Nothing": "For three entire hours, Tarantino took you about the 60's landscape Hollywood with a surprising placidness up until the end where he reminds you what he does best. Bloody Violence and Hilarious Depravity.But really this was Tarantino, Manically stroking himself like a cat saying \"Look how good I am\" as he brings you around this love letter to Hollywood.Would recommend, But not watching again.", "Once Upon a Masterpiece": "This movie gets better each time you watch it, the pure detail and work that went into the film is astonishing. As a person with a fond appreciation for the past such as old Hollywood and classic westerns the first hour of this movie was special to watch. Brad Pitt & DiCaprio are the coolest combo since Paul Newman & Robert Redford making this film even more enjoyable to watch. The ending is also extremely entertaining and satisfying.", "Brad should have stayed with the Coen Brothers": "Sooooo disappointing. Lacks anything to get or keep me interested.", "Worst QT movie ever!": "I will keep this short and simple: the movie had great actors but an absolutely horrible storyline. I had to plead with my wife to have her stay and watch the whole movie; and she did. I don't know how I'm going to make it up to her for wasting our time.", "Great acting, nice cinematography, plot line was slow and left me shaking my head amd of course the ending was nuts.": "Acting was a 10\nComedy factor was a 7\nCinematography was a 9\nPlotline was a 4I gave this an honest 6 out of 10.The plot line for me was rather boring and just felt like I was watching different people's lifes without any real character development. The acting was amazing though and there was some scenes that had me laughing.The classic ending was of course wild but a little over the top and felt out of place in the film but still entertaining.The cinematography was great for a retro movie.I am glad I seen it but I wouldn't watch it again.", "Boring just could not get into it.": "I tried but this was so boring I just could not get into it.", "Just because it's by Tarantino doesn't mean it's good.": "I'm sick of this mentality that just because Tarantino makes one film after such a long time everything that comes out of it is a work of art and if you don't like it you didn't understand it.\nBlind Tarantino fans need to evolve just like the industry has. After a point you get sick of having more than 20 minutes of a camera just focusing on feet throughout the movie.\nThe plot was mediocre at best and unnecessarily prolonged on backstories which connected vaguely and randomly.\nThe end was a typical Tarantino all out scene, with a few good references throughout the movie but overall it was quite a terrible experience.\nI hate how it was marketed entirely around Sharon Tate and Margot Robbie still got such little and insignificant camera time. Pretty disappointed.", "super good movie": "By and large, I think this is the director's best work. There is a lot of humor in this film. I like this film very much.", "Save your time and money": "Tedious and overhyped. Hope its Tarantino's last film.", "Worst Tarantino movie ever...": "This movie is a masterpiece in boredom and indifference.\n3 independent storylines that goes nowhere.\nWhat does it contain ?\nClever dialog ? No\nDrama ? No.\nSuspence ? No\nFun ? No\nAction ? A little at the end.\nProduction quality is above average, that's the only positive thing I can think of.\nIf Tarantino has run out of ideas I hope this will be his last movie.", "Next time, lead with the blood": "Stick with me and I think you'll see my point...Q is the greatest, I love (in no particular order) Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Death Proof, Reservoir Dogs, KB 1&2 and even Hateful Eight. And, I think his best screenplay was True Romance, I love the guy! I couldn't wait to see \"Hollywood\" on opening night. The problem was, then I saw it. And, it just isn't funny, which is odd. Here is what I think happened.It's odd because in most of his other movies I usually laugh way more, so it isn't like Q can't write funny. But I do think that he can't write only funny. Here is my 2 cents.Q has indicated in interviews (paraphrasing here) that he likes to play with the audience and make them laugh in the middle of the most horrifying scenes. Examples that come to mind are, \"I shot Marvin in the face\" and when M. Blonde talks to the sliced off ear. But when these jokes happen in his films they aren't just joke/story/joke/story. Instead QT sprinkles those laughs throughout his gory awesome flics and it always works because the weight of the well executed bloody violence is given relief by the joke. And the relief makes the joke way more funny because it isn't expected.In \"Hollywood\" however, the jokes aren't mostly centered around blood but rather they are for the most part just jokes and frankly, Q isn't the best at writing just comedy.He is, however, the best at writing QT type movies and in those movies the jokes get great laughs. So, while watching \"Hollywood\", nobody laughed much at all until the final 15 minutes and then I thought...next time, lead with the blood.", "An entertainer par excellence...": "3 geniuses working in perfect harmony to create magic on screen. DiCaprio and Brad Pitt alternate in creating magical moments which stitches up into a decent story. Just when u feel it's dragging a bit a brilliant spark flies out and nothing better than Brad Pitt vs Bruce Lee shoot. It's a brilliant work of shear entertainment by Quentin .. a must watch for his fans or otherwise", "Hanging out in Hollywood": "This movie is very similar to Linklater's Slacker in the sense where it feels like a hangout movie. Where the viewer is simply hanging out with the characters at a certain point of time in their lives. The movie is a lot about the journey, and less about the end.It is also a loveletter to Hollywood from Tarantino. A somewhat nostalgia trip. Probably his most nostalgic and indulgent film, characteristic of veteran and aging auteurs. It is an ode to his art, his medium, his inspirations and childhood dreams. In this aspect it very similar to Radio Days by Woody Allen.This movie requires a certain class of viewer to appreciate it. It most definitely will not be appreciated by all.", "I'm missing something or expectations of QT have plummeted": "I was so looking forward to this movie because of the killer cast and the hype. I was extremely disappointed. Pitt was excellent and Leo was ok but the story meandered nowhere. The first 2 hours and 10 minutes dragged on and on. Sure it provided some foundation for the ending but Leo just as easily could have been a limo driver instead of a washed up actor and it wouldn't have mattered. Some sharp dialogue but a let down overall.", "Bad movie, well done but empty.": "Stop, respect yourself, do not watch this movie, it is empty, I felt anger after wasting 3 hours of my precious life watching this, the trailer and the marketing are interesting, but it is really bad.", "Didn't really understand what did i watch.": "Wasted my 2 hours. No story apart from trip down the memory lane.", "Rule of thumb - Beware hitchhiking hippies!": "The trailer did not interest me whatsoever and though I enjoy Tarantino films, I've never been a mega fan, after about half an hour I was hooked, it is a really interesting and intelligently written film, that albeit takes a while to get going but for avid film fans has little nods to actors and actresses from the 60s and 70s. I was googling people galore and loving learning about the people involved in the film.First and foremost it is a film fantasy, it is based on age film star Rick Dalton(Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stuntman, Cliff Booth(Brad Pitt) and there journey of navigating the pitfalls of not being the main men anymore. Well when you've got Bruce Lee and Steve McQueen around, you are going to start to fade a little bit! Then you add in Roman Polanski (a very scandalous figure) and his wife Sharon Tate and top it off with the followers of Charles Manson and you have an explosive combination.In reality Sharon Tate and her house guests were brutally murdered by Manson's followers in one of the biggest stories of the 60s. The events in this film lead up to that shocking moment.Mr DiCaprio and Mr Pitt are both powerhouses and two more talented and charismatic actors, it would be hard to find. Mr Pitt deservedly won his first acting Oscar for this role, it's just mind blowing that it was his first. Margot Robbie is perfect as Sharon Tate and brings the starlet's brightness and hope to life. Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Maya Hawke and Margaret Qualley amongst others bring the horror to Manson's followers, everyday people warped and turned into murderous shells.The story is well-written, the film is superbly acted and takes a side road away from reality to bring a touch of Hollywood to the screen. The ending is violently bloodthirsty enough for any Tarantino fan and for me actually made me sad about the fate of Miss Tate and her friends, people I did not know to much about before this film.I do enjoy a film that makes me want to learn about the characters and takes well-known faces and makes me believe them in their roles. For a film I did not want to watch, it is one I'd happily watch again. A 16/20 from me. Well done Mr Tarantino for taking a horrific real-life story and being able to turn it into a film fantasy without disrespecting the people involved.", "Underwhelmed": "I like to walk away from a movie wanting to have something to talk about but this didn't do it for me. To say QT worked on the screen play for five years was quite astonishing.\nThere wasn't much of a plot going on here, a two hour ride of pretty boring cinema then 45 mins of a more pacy ride. Brad Pitt was excellent and the cinematography was good. I left the cinema looking at the faces of the audience who looked bewildered and quite underwhelmed.", "Great actors": "The story wasn't that good but Pitt's, DiCaprio's, and Robbie's acting performance was fascinating. Very immersive.", "Just a waste of time.": "I like Tarantino movies but this was totally awful. I am giving the 4 stars just for the good acting. If you don't watch it you don't miss anything.By the way it seems that the expense of the whole movie is paid by tobacco lobbies.", "Yeah... no.": "Apologies to everyone who scored this really low. Before I saw it I referred to you all as \"haters\". But, you were all correct, this movie is not Tarentino's best. It's not his worst either (that being Deathproof). If you can't wait to watch it, I recommend going with a group, or right now while there are still large audiences going. Otherwise, just wait for it to be on Netflix, it'll likely be on there soon.", "Wish it were like this in real life. Anyway, it is another masterpiece of Tatantino": "Whoo, I felt like if i am in those years, i would have been dreamed of being a film star or a martial art star like,\"Bruce Lee\". Story is about a man who rosed to fame in Television. Thinking his career is failing. This is not his story only. It's about the people of star in the Hollywood's Golden Age who lived in this alternate version, now dead or still alive in real life. Being a star is always tough, never gets easier unless we make it our way to the top. You know what, I was and am still always a big fan of the stars of the Hollywood's Golden Age even though they died in real life. They remains in my soul.However, the methods of this marvelous story is beautiful and impeccible. The performances of the cast, especially, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie, were breathtakingly outstanding which one of these three artist who shows their talent through acting, has received an award From Academy Awards. That was Brad Pitt. He received a Best supporting Actor.This film became an imagination and have been in my thoughts. It was a great and a masterpiece film.", "Slow but nice": "While the Manson family is planning their murders, Rick Dalton is fighting with depression, ageing and watching his career slowing down.A bit slow but fun Tarantino movie, that shows a lof of details of 60s/70s in Hollywood and is mostly carried by a great performance of Leonardo DiCaprio!After killing Hitler in Inglorious Basterds, this time Tarantino changes past happenings again and saves the life of Sharon Tate.Enjoyable!", "One of the greatest movies ever!!!": "I love all of Quentin tarantino's movies, but this is my most favorite Besides death proof (2007)This is some of rare movies from Hollywood that stand out from the crowd. And I love & enjoy it very much. Its original, unpredictable and outside of the box.Wonderful directing, great cinematography, terrific acting.I truly believe that this movie actually came from 1969. That's how great is was. Also great twists and turns on what happened if the killers got the taste of their own medicine, instead of Sharon Tate and her friends that nightAlso love that they shot the whole thing on film and in different formats (8mm, 16mm and 35mm) love to do that in my movies as well.This is an Oscar winner. I Give this movie 9/10", "As I predicted...": "Boring and overrated. Movie was uneventful, and made for a specific boomer audience. I could have benefited from a heads up QT.", "Wasted Opportunity": "If you have Brad Pitt and Leo Di Caprio in a project in lead roles and 2 hours 41 minutes of screen time write something that makes sense. I was looking forward to those two expertly banging out Tarantino dialogue and banter but there isn't one good conversation scene in this. Unfortunately what you do get is almost three hours of complete nonsense that goes nowhere.", "Self indulgent film": "The first two hours in my opinion could have been cut down to 1 hour just so much self indulgent filming going on, I was thinking at one point why am I watching Brad Pitt driving down road with wind blowing through his hair for 5 minutes? The other scenes where QT was remaking films was just too much and too long, we get it you loved these films and wanted to do something with them but I don't want to watch a film within a film, it became so disjointed at one point just trying to do little random self indulgent scenes.\nI will say the final part was the only time I didn't find myself fighting to turn it off, it was good hence the 3 stars, but pretty lame idea of a wealthy out of touch celebrity of saving a few celebrities in his film.", "Unreal film": "Brad and Leo are amazing and the final scenes are worth the wait", "Only for 70. Hollywood fans": "I have to admit the title says clear its a \"once upon a time in hollywood\" movie so if you like me don't know anything about 70. Hollywood maybe the Film wasn't made for you tooI'am from europe and was persuaded to watch this hyped movie (sorry we don't have 70. Hollywood in history class here)So i just watched a 2:50h slice of live in 1969 hollywood Movie, one or two laughers otherwise nothing happens...so if you like this Time, place and Genre maybe thats your movie.Attention!! The last 10min of the Movie i unfortunately watched an disgusting gore movie (sorry i don't like that ) ...and than the end ... !!! ...??After this movie and with the help of Google\nI guess this Movie is:\na prequel from the neighbors who where murdered by the Manson family.", "What the hell did I just watch!": "The biggest waste of 3 hours of my life! Honestly was horrible. What was the point, there is no plot, and everything is everywhere.", "Extremely Disappointed": "I've always liked Tarantino's work. However, this movie it's not his best. Three hours! For not an action movie. The first act was fine. The second act was dreadfully long and boring. The last act was the best, unfortunately it was not enough for me to like the entire movie.", "The Trailer Was The Movie !!": "The Trailer Featured a Plot with Great Cinematography,Action and everything we look for in a Quentin Tarantino Film However the actual Movie simply put was the extra bonus features of the trailer with extended scenes including some great vintage landmarks from the era that many of us remember\ni give the Trailer a solid 9 for one of the best short films of the year and the actual movie a 7 for obvious reasons.", "It's almost great": "I won't lie, I was yawning and checking the time for a large portion of the film. The acting is great but there was no plot and so much that didn't add to the story that should have been cut. I was also hoping for more background on Pitts character and his wife but it never came to fruition. The ending makes putting up with the rest of it worth it at least once. I know I'll never see this movie again though because being bored for 2/3 of a movie isn't fun. If I had been watching it at home I would have turned it off but since I was in the theatre I stuck it out but it was tough. The ending was great but was the only interesting part of the movie. I hope the two leads get nominations for their outstanding performances but QT has lost his touch as a storyteller for sure.", "Great actors in horrible story": "In my opinion the worst Tarentino movie. Was bored at first, But ofcause gave it a chance since Its Quintin....2 hours later i had to give up. Was just a waste of time. Was not entertained at Any moment.", "Slow, but worth the outcome.": "A little dry and slow to follow. But just be patient. It'll be worth it in the end. One of those movies that makes you read the synopsis to fully understand it and all the characters. But solid film.", "Watching the movie I thought maybe it is me?": "I hated the movie. I thought it was overly long. I thought the plot was stupid. I honestly didn't like a single thing about it except for Brad Pitt. He is always great to look at. I was there with 3 other people and all four of us hated it.", "2 hours I am never getting back": "Hard pass on this self indulgent piece of trash... We get it you're in LA in the 70s... Enough of the laurel canyon elongated driving shots.. They're not even single shot just really long and pointless", "One hour too long": "I have only ever seen one good movie that was longer than 2 1/2 hours (and that was Titanic) this movie certainly was not one of them", "Shile-o-pite": "Sort but multiple stories, seriously that was 2.5 hours I'll never get back. Nothing wrong with the acting that was great but the was no story. Apart from the violence in the last 10 minutes it was a total waste of time.\nEnjoy!", "Beautiful movie, not a classic Tarantino movie": "I personally enjoyed the movie, for many reasons. Quentin didn't go for a full beggining to end violence. It was more quiet, chill, at least for the most part. I saw a different aproach comparing to his most famous films, such as Pulp Fiction. I am a big 60's fan (in films) so the pictures and cinematography were incredible to me. I understand if there are people that don't like it , maybe hoped for a more classic Tarantino, but I think it shows that he has more in his head that just violence.", "Yes he did it again !": "Tarantino is always Tarantino. Even he mentions the naked truth in his movies, he dresses it up.\nThe movie proceeds in his orbit. Absurd, unexpected and unbalanced violence scenes stage in the cinematography as usual. Roles of the vfp (very famous person) in the movie, it's also a usual characteristic of a Tarantino movie.\nAs you approach to the end while watching it, you will understand what I mean at the beginning of the article as he surprises the audience again with a real story touches interpreted by his own.", "Unbearable": "I am sorry, but this was the most boring and uneventful movie I have ever seen in my life. The only thing that made me stay till the end was the money I paid to watch it, I didn't want it to go completely to waste. Not everyone shared this however as half of the people in the cinema left 1 hour in. It was absolutely dreadful.", "A real mixed bag, this one...": "Tremendous style, cinematography and acting, but ultimately, I was bored.Engagement or the act of engaging the audience, is a film's number one objective, and I don't believe Tarantino's latest film does too well on that front. There will be people who disagree and state that this film is a 10/10 masterpiece, but for me, that is ridiculous. The MANY will likely find this film too long, pretentious and have an insufferable plot with a number of random scenes and characters that ultimately have little to do with the conclusion.On the flip side, all the scenes are separately engaging, as of course are 'Tarantino-esque '. Also Dicaprio and Pitt are great throughout. And 1960's Hollywood is captured magnificently. But it just didn't add up very well for me.Also the very OTT violence at the end. It feels like Quentin suddenly realised his story was lacking bloodshed, so pencilled in as much brutality as he could in the final ten minutes. Yes it's tongue in cheek and meant to be comic, but it is also very, very violent and inflicted on young women. This violence, perpetrated by Pitt's and Dicaprio's characters, also did not add up or make sense based on their behaviours through the earlier film.", "Disapointment": "For years I have read about Tarantino being rude and way to excentric but is not until these days that I can totally recognize what they were talking about. Portraining such false image of Bruce Lee with no value added is just nonsense. Although the movie is a 7 star I rated it 1 for such transsgression. The guy has drifted to far from greatness, I will never spend a dime on this burnout.", "Great actors acting but little else": "So this is a weird film. It's quite enjoyable to watch but on reflection, the film just doesn't have any content to refer back to. The main/only strength of this film is to watch two fine actors giving it their all with great characters who are developed so well over an almost 3 hour period but apart from the occasional random scene, they're left to flicker and fade in an otherwise rambling journey that ultimately goes nowhere. QT has definitely toned down his stylised approach for this although it has som really nice touches when old classsics are revisited with a twist ;) But for a film with this little content to be almost 3 hours is just silly and pointless no matter how endearing it is to see Leo and Brad out in such great performances. QT once again almost succeeded here but the film lacked pace and content and ultimately felt a little flat and will be another 'could have, should have' in the QT archives.", "Feels like the traing cur-scene in a video game.": "Everything is just so drawn out, forced and deliberate.The precocious child actor for example, \" I believe it's the job of an actor, and I say actor not actress because the word actress is nonsensical. It's the actor's job to avoid impediments to their performance. It's the actor's job to strive for 100% effectiveness.\"\nHow ironic.And thats just one of many awfully delivered lines. Thats a child, but Pacino is just as bad.This has to be the worst Tarantino movie ever made and if it wasn't a QT movie it wouldn't have the cast and it wouldn't have been made. Absolutely drawn out with no pay off (that I have seen in 4 attmpe]ts anyway - still haven't made it to the end).", "What did i just watch?": "Very strange movie. Almost turned it off for like 10 times. For me not Tarantino s best movie. Too long also.", "Genuinely shocked, and not in a good way.": "No plot. Characters are meh - Brad Pitt is pretty cool, Dicaprio is fine, Robbie's entire role consists of going to the cinema and not paying for a ticket and then being pregnant. Annoying little girl, annoying hippie characters, plotlines that lead to nowhere.Only one thing can save a movie with no plot and unexceptional characters: humour. Humour in this movie, for the most part, consists of such gems as 'isn't it funny when people do drugs?', and 'this woman has an Italian accent!'I love Tarantino, but I don't know what this is. It's worse than Death Proof.Oh, and the foot fetish came out far too much this time, Quentin. I'm 90% sure that Margot Robbie was hired entirely so he could have her feet onscreen.", "A Masterwork of Lasting Worth": "It took me a few views to appreciate the virtuosity of this Movie. Every scene is filled with exquisite judgement and taste. The attention to detail lends weight and depth to every frame. We are fully in this world, seemingly without artifice, till the last moment and beyond.It is a Film school all of it's own, in every discipline.", "Too Long, Too Uneven, Too Unpolished": "After months of anticipation, I couldn't wait to hit the theaters on opening night to see Quentin Tarantino's 10th film \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\".\n(sorry people, but it really is his 10th despite his incorrect claims).So after leaving the cinema, I was disappointed. Couldn't believe the 8.9 rating on IMDB and people talking about Oscars for this movie. First, Brad and Leo give great performances. They really made this movie watchable and without them, I would've never made it to the end. Brad is especially fun to watch as he smirks and postures two and fro, looking totally cool and putting people in their place as they embarrass themselves left and right, i.e. Bruce Lee and the Manson family member at the Ranch. DiCaprio is the foil to Pitt's character as he's an anxious, neurotic, stuttering mess of a once super hot TV actor that is now struggling to keep afloat in 1969 Hollywood. The chemistry these two have breathes life into an otherwise stagnant script. If we could only isolate Brad and Leo's performances, I would give this movie a 10. However, they are not alone, and their performances cannot cover horrible plot, random cameos, unfunny conversations, dirty feet, and awful Kurt Russell voiceover.The dialogue. Let it be said, it's not good. This is especially surprising, considering QT normally writes engaging scripts even if some of it's stretched thin. But with Once Upon a Time, the dialogue is completely throwaway and uninteresting. A couple one-liners from Brad and Leo are not enough for 3 hour movie.Empty space. Lots of empty space for a nearly 3 hour movie. Many long, drawn out shots of Brad driving around Los Angeles, feeding dog, and jumping on roof to fix antenna. Yes, editing is for fools.Random people. Too many random famous people who randomly appear on screen and leave never to be seen again. The whole supporting cast felt like Where's Waldo. Scoot McNairy, Michael Madsen, Damian Lewis, Emile Hirsch, Timothy Olyphant, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, Luke Perry, and Al Pacino all do their best, but the script is hiding from them. Tragic underuse of a phenomenal group of performers.Sharon Tate character. Margot Robbie is beautiful to look and is a great actress but the script hides from her, too. She had maybe three scenes in entire movie. Two of those scenes she sleeps and watches own movie. Yes, Oscar for Robbie is a must.Boring storyline. Very boring storyline for 3 hour movie. The first 2+ hours are a complete unpolished bore filled with Tarantino self indulgence of bare feet and boring scenes and tired 60s pop culture references. It isn't until Brad starts killing Manson family members that the movie becomes a little exciting. You can finally see some plot breaking through the rubbish you watched from earlier in the movie. However, once Leo uses flamethrower to kill last Manson member in swimming pool, movie ends.That said, I did enjoy the movie in patches and indeed there are moments of brilliance such as Brad on the boat with wife and the invisible crew talking offscreen to Leo when he can't remember his lines in the Western saloon with Timothy Elephant. The cinematography is gorgeous and Robert Richardson is a genius with his camera. Production design is top notch. But as it stands, the movie is too long, too uneven, and too unpolished.5 stars for Brad and Leo and some great cinematography and 60s set pieces.", "Overhyped!": "Not up to the hype and a very weak plot.\nAs we have seen in recent time, hollywood movies have become too predictable in its plot and they have become all about flashy exhibition of lifestyle.\nMay be not expecting too much will make you rate this movie a bit higher may be 5 but with such a hype before its been a letdown.", "Still a good movie, but also shows Tarantino is losing his ways.": "A good story, and generally entertaining movie, but,1. My biggest complaint, is that the colors are awful, people's skin look like they are made of mud. I thought Tarantino likes 35mm.2. Uneven pace, and long and boring at times.3. His signature violence seem out of place and unwarranted this time.", "Dross": "No interesting story, nothing clever, just a really long biography with a bit of a Tarrantino-esque ending.Neither of the main characters was particularly engrossing. Are we meant to have sympathy for the \"struggling actor\" cliche?Probably the worst film I've seen in a long time ... on a par with Nocturnal Animals. Another long film with no story line but gets good reviews from self-important cinema buffs.", "Genial masterpiece": "This is a fantastic movie for those who understand and know the background story. Truly genius work.", "Enjoyable experience.": "I found this movie to be entertaining, cool, funny and just interesting.I especially loved seeing hollywood in a time like this, where probably most stoners and LSD abusers were around. Hippies were portraied pretty cool aswell. Dicaprio and Brad Pitt's acting was also very good and realistic.", "August 19th and 20th impressions of the movie - multiple realities + In Dreams": "My third review of the movie.\nSomething does not let go, after multiple viewing of the movie.\nNow I believe that multiple realities exist in the movie at the same time. One, \"grounded\" reality is the real-life persons' life, up to a point. Another, \"real-fictional\" reality are the lives of Rick and Cliff, as we follow them on-screen. The third, \"unreliable-fictional\" reality are the flashbacks of all protagonists, as it is the way they remember them, or would like to remember them, or it is the way they perceive them. Then, we have the reality starting by Manson killers driving up Cielo Dr. This reality should be called \"dream-fictional\" reality, as it is the result of all the previously mentioned realities.\nSome reviewers would like us to believe, that the last reality didn't really happen. Well, guess what, most of the things in this movie didn't really happen. There was no Cliff Booth coming to Spahn's Movie Ranch with Pussycat, checking everything and everybody out and leaving a bad taste for everybody involved. This thing simply did not occur. But it did. And it leads to many turning points in the finale. However, the \"dream-fictional\" reality of the finale can happen only within the overall framework of all the stories, that we face during the movie.\nTherefore, the elements like acid laced cigarette, drinking overload, change of plan by Manson disciples, the showdown, and whatever comes next in altogether another reality from all of the above, let's call it \"conditional future reality\".\nSuch reality is completely outrageous, if we compare it to the \"real\" reality, the one we know from the history books.\nWhich brings forward certain questions:\nIt is not really important what happens to Rick and Cliff, they are fictional characters. Also, such things happen in Hollywood, like career crash or career revival, quite circumstantially, or on a basis of human factor decision. Some of these decisions were undertaken by QT himself, not infrequently.\nIt is, on the other hand, crucially important what happens to Sharon. We meet her, briefly enough, but substantially enough to perceive her, to a certain degree, for what she represents (I still think Margot is not able to replicate Sharon fully, but that's beside the point). The tendency is here, and many people can recognize it. And yet, some hippies calling themselves the Manson family decided to destroy this life, for reasons clear to them alone. The consequences of this act were fatal, to this day. Whatever would have happened to Polanski, had his wife survived, what kind of movies he would have made instead, what kind of life he would have lived, would there be a \"Chinatown\" at all?\nThere is a whole chain of events, that could have been averted, if...\n...or not. If it was a \"hit\", it would have happened anyway, or anyway it would have been repeated. Or, was it all about the money, and Manson's musical career? Or his \"religion and movement\", that was not acceptable? Because, the murders that happened, meant \"the end\" also for the perpetrators and everything connected to them.\nSo far, I managed to get closer only to the real Sharon, through different materials available on the Internet: her movies, her roles, the role in the TV shows, some short interviews and fashion clips.\nThe observation does not waver - she was the nicest person, full of compassion, joie-de-vivre, hidden wisdom, but also secretive, mystical, and infinitely fatalistic.\nAlso, it is important to note her voice from the interphone (in the movie), on 2 occasions (in August) - it is a modulated Sharon Tate voice, it is not Margot Robbie's voice. Of course, QT has chosen the closest approximation possible casting Margot Robbie, as her physical looks and appearance, her inherent positive nature and goodness, all these contribute to a likeness that is fascinating. To a degree that it seems like QT really wanted to find and define Sharon closest to her real-life self. To a degree. The accent is wrong, the speech pattern is wrong, the air of mystique is missing, some other features of the character are not exactly right. And, we get to see the real Sharon on a screen, and we get to listen to her voice.\nThere is another quest for Sharon, that I have identified, by no other than David Lynch in original Twin Peaks. If you combine the roles of Laura Palmer (Maddy Palmer) + Audrey Horne - if you combine the 2 actresses and their respective roles in the series, you get a person, that would've been Sharon Tate, had she lived (but without getting older, which she never did).\nIt is an obvious fascination by 2 of the greatest film auteurs of our time, and I have already mentioned a feeling I have about Once upon a time in Hollywood vs. Mulholland Drive.\nObviously, QT is obsessed with \"final\" stages of the creative process. He has correctly observed, that many artists, even and especially the ones, where their outlook is not of primary concern, i.e. where aging and such does not directly influence the marketability of the person, also, sooner or later reach the point of being \"less useful\" or obsolete.\nHe has done his homework, as always. There is a number of film directors, writers, other type of authors, that have reached a breaking point in their respective careers relative to artistic development, in other words \"the law of diminishing returns\" kicked in.\nThere can be many factors to this effect, from natural aging, substance abuse, world-weariness, a combination of the above. It can be a generation (shift) thing, as well, as you may just as well be on the cutting edge of an industry for - 10 years? 20 - 30 years - perhaps? More - not very likely.\nI believe this is also the background of QT's \"retirement plan\". He would like to stay ahead of the curve also in this department. He would like to stay faster than his opponents.\nI can't say if he is right or wrong.\nYes, there are indications for all these possible outcomes.\nAlso, most of the great constructive artists really faced a decline in their respective outputs, somewhere after 60, or 65, or 70. Many of them also died young, so to speak, their curve was interrupted. And there are those, that did not fall into any of these categories - rare individuals, that continued and continue creating long after their peers went to obsoletion.\nSo it is not really a done thing. The question is, is there anything else one has to say? Is there anything more, that can be shared with the world? Is there anything, where you can still represent an avant-garde?\nAnd, even more important: is there anybody coming up? Are there new talents of the new generations, that are up to the speed? We are talking about art, originality, creative process, ideas, interpretation, etc., not about business, sales, coal mining, etc. The natural law may not necessarily apply.\nThat's why we have QT. That's why we need Sharon Tate.In Dreams (August 20th)\nFourth time a charm. This story has sequels, as I have watched the movie again, and new ideas come, that I consider worth sharing.\nThis time, I decided to go easy. Just like the 5th viewing of the movie. I know the story, the sets, the dialogues, the sequence of events, I recognize most of the soundtrack.\nThe 5th viewing was for the feeling. How does it feel to drive around Hollywood of 1969, how cool it can be at Playboy mansion on Saturday evening, what kind of music was playing on the radio, how come it's always warm in LA, WTF were Paul Revere & the Raiders?\nEvery scene with Sharon is a delight. It is \"in dreams\". As it is not 1969, and we don't live in an alternate world, that was a consequence of the story from the movie.\n\"Bring back the romantic age...\" somebody would say. Alas, nobody can do that, as the past as we would like to remember it, did not necessarily happen. So it doesn't mean that other past (that did not happen), is actually unreal. Perhaps both these versions are equally hard to objectivize.\nWe know the consequences of all these moments of time. On a personal level, these are disastrous, as always. On a broader level, they may have or may not have had any impact to the course of history.\nThe movie is about the \"factory of dreams\". It is full of alternate realities, and it feels like a dream. It is an experiment of how to combine destinies of real people and fictional characters in one set-up. I can't say it hasn't been done before, but I can say that this time it has been done right.\nI may have to see the movie again, or even a few more times. Some feeling is still missing. It would be helpful to have an intermission. Whatever, when the DVD / Blu Ray comes out, you can have as many intermissions, as you wish.\nAnd if I remember correctly, it was QT who once argued, that the \"home entertainment\" principle of watching movies is a completely different experience compared to the theater experience...\nYes, bring back the easy life, when people could drive around listening to the radio, people could hitch-hike, people could drop in on celebrities or just hang out at Playboy mansion.", "In Memory of Sharon Tate": "The ending was worth it all if you know the real story of what happened. Overall it was a plesant movie to watch. The regular Tarentino antics can be seen throughout the movie. Seriously dude get over your foot fetish already, it's super creepy. Thank you for your ending though, it was perfect, and I really appreciated it.", "10 minutes of tarantino in a 150 minutes film": "If you're looking for a good tarantino movie,this is not one.

It is not one of his worst movies,even though there were moments when I thought that my patience is being tested.Although I expected more bloody and violent scenes,the movie did not miss the exciting and juicy moments.I liked Brad Pitt here a little more than Leonardo DiCaprio,I liked their characters chemistry and friendship.I also liked the little hippie girl played by Margaret Qualley.

Whooo, that's a cool story man.", "References: The Movie": "Rather than tell the story of the Tate murders, Tarantino drops lots of references. As someone unfamiliar with the Tate murders it was frustrating to see the story alluded to rather than told.Then again my friend who is familiar with the story was equally confused and disappointed. I guess that's what happens when a 161 minute movie doesn't tell a story.", "Fun flick, but seems lost": "Once upon a time...in Hollywood takes many real life events of the late 60s and adds a few fictional characters to turn a few nudges on the actual happenings.\nThe atmosphere of Hollywood in the late 60s felt nice and was well executed all the way around (from fonts, to set design, music, etc.). It evokes nostalgia even for people who just saw movies OF that time (not AT that time). But of course, people who are familiar with actors and movies of that era will get much more out of this since there are a lot of references and sometimes even real scenes from old movies are shown.Dicaprio gives a wonderful performance (actually I thinks this is my favourite role of his) of a western movie and tv star that sees his career on a descending branch, while his stunt double (brad pitt), lives a far less luxurious life but doesnt really care about any of that. The role of Sharon Tate (a meanwhile deceased real movie star) is thrown in more or less arbitrarily since she doesnt have anything to do in the plot, just with the real-life ending to this movie, which doesnt happen.And here it is where the problems start. Because while every scenen in itself works well, has humour, sometimes heart (and a very low amount of violence for QT), sometimes tension, the whole package lacks structure, something to follow, something that keeps your interest because everything is just tied together very loosely. Almost every scene could be taken out and it wouldnt change anything.\nI will admit, this can work for some movies, those kind of movies that bring up questions, those movies that are slow, but still manage to occupy your mind all the way through (2001 is a good example). But Once upon a time...in hollywood is not one of these movies, its just stuff happening. Which seriously is a pitty, because everything else works so well, but around the end of the second act it was dragging so much that I actually grew restless and bored, something I absolutely didnt anticipate in a QT film. Till the end there also really isnt any payoff that could redeem this lack of narrative, give it some purpose. Theres just more stuff happening, then its over.The only explanation I have for some of those high ratings are the simple fact that QT directed and that it stars Dicaprio and Pitt (and maybe also the nostalgia part). Because I can guarantee everyone, that if this was an Indie-film it would have a rating of something like 6-6.8 and many reviews would say something like \"self-indulging indie-trash\".Conclusion: Pleasant movie, maybe watch it while youre having friends over. But if you want some real entertaining movie, keep looking.", "Why? Just why?": "Pointless 2.40 hours waiting for something to happen and nothing really does.While Leonardo DiCaprio embodies his role and he brings a lot of empathy to his role as a fading leading man, Brad Pitt's role does not have depth or a character arc which gives him nothing much to do till the end of the movie.The period of the late 60's is captured well and money can do that. What was missing was depth to the narrative and one goes to a Tarinto movie expecting the twists, turns and dark humour which is absent in this movie. Rabid fans lap up anything and i can also shake my head in disbelief at some of the reviews of the movie. Well, the master tanked and the believers are yet to wake up to it.", "I LOVE Q.T. but this was Anti-climactic": "Cast was phenomenal. Acting was wonderful. Visually it was fantastic.

Halfway through the movie, I asked myself \"what is the plot?\" By the end, there was no answer. Yes, the different storylines came together at the very end, but they still didn't make sense. The movie could have been cut to an hour-and-a-half without losing any of the so-called plot (and still would have been just as confusing and meaningless).

It has a good look and good music, but that's about it. Nothing really happens for the first 2 hours. It definitely should have been trimmed down. - We get scenes from a bad western in it for no reason. It just takes forever to go anywhere.The first 2 hours show none of Tarantino's usual flare. There's no scenes with interesting dialog or characters. - I was left squirming in my seat waiting for something interesting. Eventually we get a silly but Tarantino style ending. It just took way too long to get there.I'm left with the question: if you don't have an interesting story to tell about the time period or the Manson family, why set the movie there?", "You really have to appreciate QT to sit through it": "Lots of kitsch.

This movie was the most boring piece of work I had to watch. We walked out in the end wondering what I'm the world we just watched. It just seems like a bunch of unrelated scenes were put together and someone decided to call it a movie. I may be missing the point of the genius behind this work, but here's the thing; I go to the theaters to enjoy my time. I watched this movie and, at no point, did this movie capture my attention. I have liked everything else that I have watched from Tarantino, but this one was just too boring and bland.", "WHO IS NOT UNDERSTANDED HERE": "This is the perfect proof of an incredible director that he can deceive the film world with a desperately bad story with a large number of quality actors and make a film that is worth nothing and that everyone praises it.\nCongratulations on the perfect deception. Please don't make movies anymore. You caan't make up for my lost time.", "I wouldn't recommend it": "I agree with a lot of the reviews here, the plot was really lacking. They drove around in cars a lot, like the whole movie. It was a cool period piece, but I think Tarantino fell asleep at the wheel on this one, made a movie for himself and forgot about the audience that was going to watch it.", "Crying DiCaprio, Old Pitt and couple weird scenes": "If this is supposed to be a good movie, I have no hope in Hollywood future. No plot, no interesting action, long boring scenes with old crying DiCaprio and old Pitt who of course had to take his shirt off on the top of the roof. This CGI could hypnotize some old women, but not me.\nTo be honest, I believe this is a movie for 40-50 year old women. It could be good, has a lot of potential, but is so chaotic, without much sense and many times even logic.\nI gave 5 for couple interesting scenes, but its really not worth wasting 3 hours for couple good minutes.", "Fantastic Tribute to Hollywood's Golden Age.": "I don't get the hate for this movie, because I enjoyed this movie a lot! The actors were fabulous!! The soundtrack was fantastic, the directing was amazing, and I loved how it resembles Hollywood in the 60s. Brad Pitt definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor!! The climax pays off all the buildup in the movie. Sure the pacing is super slow, but it was enjoyable when you watch it again, and it makes the buildup to the climax worth it! I think this is a great film for Quentin Tarantino, and I loved how he tried to do something different here than in his other works. Overall, I absolutely enjoyed this movie, and I think it deserves those nominations!!", "Not better than pulp fiction but holds up": "Don't go in with any hype. Clearly a lot of people are comparing it to pulp fiction and I would say it's far from it. This movie stands alone as another Quentin Tarantino movie. You know you'll get great dialogue, cinematography, and just a good time at the movies. Also, THIS IS NOT A CHARLES MANSON FILM. So don't go in expecting it's going to be a manson film. The story does seem like a plot is building up but there are no major turning points in the story. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting is phenomenal and Brad Pitt is the cool stunt guy. I feel like this movie is more appreciated by people who were born and raised in Los Angeles with great shots of the city and getting the feeling of how it was in 1969. So with that being said, it will most likely be a miss for many viewers.

Major disappointment", "Worst movie": "Sorry guys but that was the worst movie I've ever seen. And i've seen a lot", "Once upon a time that wasn't quite like this": "Quentin Tarantino's early movies were a blast, proof you don't need to be subtle to be clever. But he lost me with 'Kill Bill', his overlong two-parter where he put all his intelligence into making a fundamentally stupid movie, and I hadn't seen any of his subsequent films before watching 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'. The film is a fictionalised version of the real episode where a weird cult brutally murdered (amongst others) Sharon Tate, wife of director Roman Polanksi, for no apparent reason. The nice thing about this movie is that Tarantino's talent is very much on display, and yet despite the subject matter, the film isn't dominated by ultra-violence. We see, not so much a real version of Los Angeles in 1969, but a beautifully created ideal of it: conceptually, the film has similarities to 'Mulholland Dr.', or 'La La Land', although Tarantino's take is clearly his and always entertaining. The end is violent, however, and a bigger departure from the true story than anything we've seen before. For me, the propensity to cartoon violence has always been the weakest element of Tarantino's style, and I don't think it quite works here either. I doubt I'll ever see a perfect Tarantino movie; with his more-is-more aesthetic, there's always going to be something just too over-the-top. But one has to credit his imaginative vision; he even gets a decent performance out of Leonardo DiCaprio, although Brad Pitt predictably steals the show.", "Making a movie with neither a plot not a narrative is NOT innovate ...": "You're sitting there waiting for the movie to start only to realise it's not going to start, this random sequence of scenes is the ENTIRE MOVIE, 90% percent is just meaningless dialouge (while sometimes funny) ultimately leads to nothing. literally speaking there are just 2 scenes that contribute to what can be considered a story. And now to my biggest criticisms for this movie:Not having a plot, storyline and/or narrative is neither ingenius nor a new genre it's just BAD. A movie that requires background knowledge to understand and does not convey this background information in the form of exposition is a BAD movie. A movie that portrays a character (Sharon Tate played by Margot Robbie) that has no impact on the story, or anything at all is a Bad movie. but we do get alot of stylish shots of her driving/doing mundane things that tell us nothing about her as a person and of course her feet.I can't stress this enough, a well constructed narrative and plot is the MOST important aspect in any film, we want to be told a story, and if there is no story to be found, what can we as the audience actually appreciate? Yes this movie had great cinematography and was filmed in a stylised manner and the soundtrack was fun, but that all doesen't matter because there was simply no story being told, scenes just happen and then the end just happens and thats the movie.If a new director did the exact same movie with unknown actors it would flop for the reasons I just mentioned. Don't let directorial hype get the best of you, this film is a miss. Let's keep it real guys. This is coming from someone who considers inglorious basterds and pulp fiction as (among other titles) some of the greatest movies in modern cinema,", "A fun and relaxing time": "Of all Quentin Tarantino's films, this is the one I feel like the most amount of people don't like. And I can see why someone would think that. The structure is flawed, some characters don't get a lot to do, and there is seemingly no final goal. With that being said, I really liked this movie. While it isn't as tightly plotted as other Tarantino movies, that actually fits it in my opinion. This movie feels like something that would be released a long time ago, definietly not today. It feels like a simple movie from a director who just wanted to have some fun, which has become a very rare thing to see. There are of course other qualities. The directing, set- and costume-design are all fantastic, as are the performances. The dialogue is great as usual, and there are plenty of scenes that doesn't serve any purpose, but still manage to be fun and entertaining. Also, the endgame in this movie is fantastic, it's a sudden jump in gore and suspense and I love it. If the movie was better paced and structured, it would be truly fantastic, but it is still a great time and a nice way to relax.", "Not Tarantino level": "Not Tarantino level. It was very slow and at times it felt he was just dragging the story.", "Not a good movie at all. Nothing happens.": "So many good characters... such a waste. Not a good movie at all. Very hard to understand the story of it as well.", "No story, slow slow...": "I was having great expectations of this movie. But when I finally saw it it was huge disappointment. Not too much happened and everything was so slow! Positive side was great cavalcade of beautiful cars (and one motorcycle)!", "Good, not great": "Lasted only a few mins with Hateful 8. This movie is good, but besides Hateful 8, arguably Tarantino's worst. Still good, but was disappointed", "Funny and disturbing. If only it was (much) shorter.": "I have mixed feelings about 'Once upon a time in...Hollywood'. Had the film been (much) shorter, I might have enjoyed it more. With a runtime of almost 3 hours, I ultimately became a bit bored with some scenes being way too long. A lot of screen time was also made up of movie clips, or with the actors shooting a movie, which I feel could have been shorter.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as actor Rick Dalton, who fears his career is coming to an end. He confides in his stunt double and friend, Cliff (Brad Pitt), who manages to motivate him. Cliff is also Rick's driver. The film is set in 1969 and we get an interesting glimpse of the film industry as it was back then. The film cleverly incorporates actual characters and events into an otherwise fictional story.'Once upon a time in...Hollywood' is well edited and well filmed. At times the photography makes you feel part of the film, instead of just watching it. There are way too many characters just coming and going, and there's plenty of foul language for the sake of comic relief. (Well, it wasn't funny.) There was also an awful lot of smoking going on here, so this is definitely for a more mature audience.I really enjoyed the film in the beginning, but as the movie developed - at a very slow pace - I started wondering what the film was actually all about. I kept asking myself \"how long till the end?\" During the final act, the film was suddenly being narrated, and I couldn't tell who the narrator was, or why it was suddenly being narrated. The final act is wild!! I didn't see this coming.The film then ends on a disturbing note which would lead to the Tate Murders (not shown in the film). For those familiar with Sharon Tate's fate, the ending will send chills down your spine.", "Sorry I wasted money on this piece of trash": "Pitt and DiCaprio were excellent, but the movie doesn't deserve any award. What a waste of money to see that piece of trash.", "A movie like no other.": "Do yourself a favor and watch this. If you love films, this is a movie movie. It's a movie that gives tribute to Hollywood and a story of the life of an actor and stuntman. So well done. Such great performances.", "Where was SLJ?": "Aside from unforgivably missing Sam Jackson this is another solid QT movie.Apart from dialogue QT's other great strength is in creating atmosphere and environment, he places you smoothly into the era the story is set and just leaves you to hang out for a while.This is a great movie (does go off on tangents occasionally but most of them work) that celebrates a great time in Hollywood.Plus, Brad Pitt in the acid fight (doesn't get much better than this).Minus, Bruce Lee, I know there were complaints about the fight scene and the outcome of it but what really sucked was this is the worst BL impersonator I have ever had the displeasure to watch...truly awful. Horrible!Thankfully its only about 10 mins of screen time with Bruce so it doesn't effect the overall movie which is one of QT's better showings. :)", "Black comedy": "I'm not a Tarantino fanboy by any stretch and often find his films hit and miss. But ONCE UPON - though a bit too long - is up there with the better ones. If you like the look of the era too you're going to love this film. Plus Brad Pitt is just so funny in a very understated way throughout.", "\"This movie didn't have a head exploding every 5 seconds so it's a bad movie\"": "If you're only watching Tarantino movies for the extreme violence then you've completely misunderstood every Tarantino movie. This is a movie about a man watching the industry he knew and loved completely change in front of his eyes and there's nothing he can do about it. This is a movie about leaving the past behind and looking to the future and how that affects people. There's a reason this wasn't marketed as a violent Charles Manson murder movie because that's never what it was meant to be. Great acting, great characters and a fantastic script. One of Tarantino's best", "An overrated piece of garbage": "Like every other Tarantino movie. Self indulgnet hollywood film.", "Man, and I thought The Hateful Eight was bad....!!": "I'm sure there must have been a reason why 2+ hours of tedious nothing was filmed, followed by a few minutes of action. This is just an awful film, with no direction, plot or any sort of interesting storyline to it. If anybody else had come up with this script it would have gone straight in the bin of every movie studio going. I hope Tarantino stops now, I certainly won't be watching anything else he does....", "By far Tarantino's weirdest film yet": "Wasn't that good ,but the ending was cool. Basically Quentin Tarantino does a spaghetti western parody within the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is the main character Brad Pitt is his stunt double. Basically the movie is pointless up until the end they prevent the Sharon Tate murders. Fictional of course. Probably almost as bad as Kill Bill 2 . The props were very cool. The old fashion TVs and cars and of course beer cans and cigarettes . But all that aside , The story made no sense whatsoever . Basically wasted 2:41 of my life that I'll never get back again lol . I love Tarantino but this film is a huge disappointment.", "Not everyone likes the Godfather": "I'll be straight forward. I have seen many reviews claiming that the movie is long, no plot, pointless..etcThe whole movie was about the last 30 - 45 min, while the remaining part was to build a deep connection between the characters and the audience. The connection would make the last part so intense, and you will certainly end watching with a mixed feelings.As I said before, not everyone likes the Godfather, and that's OK.", "Wow was this disappointing": "Loved the acting, especially DiCaprio when he's yelling at himself in the mirror or Pitt when he's confronting people high on acid. After that this is a potpourri of things happening with little or no purpose. These were too good of characters to go nowhere. I get people want to love Tarantino because I want to love Tarantino. Just way to much missed opportunity for an almost three hour movie to leave on the table.", "My least favourite Quentin film": "My anticipation of this movie was high because Quentin Tarantino movies have always rated top drawer with me.\nFor and opening 10/15 minutes, the introduction to the characters is fairly strong and what you'd expect for most films, but following this, there isn't really any grabbing storyline.\n*spoilers ahead*\nWhile I never felt bored while watching Rick Dalton's(Leonardo DeCaprio) struggles in his late acting career and Cliff Booth's(Brad Pitt) adventures as he drove round looking for things to do as an unemployed stuntman; I just constantly felt like something more needed to happen.\nEven when late on in the film, we find Cliff discovering his old acting set has been taken over by a group of hippies (Mansons cult), there's a lot of tension and feeling that this is where it all starts to unfold and the story is going to get more eventful...but apart from a slightly entertaining beat down delivered by Brad's character, again this comes to nothing.Credit where it's due, the final 15 minutes do become very \"Quentin-esque\" as the almost comic style violence does meet expectations, but unfortunately for me, this was too late on to save the films overall rating.While I understand the purpose behind the films story, that Leonardo's character needed a reason to befriend his way into his hollywood director (Roman Polanski's) neighbour's house so he could re-vamp his own Hollywood career and that this weird backstory(which is very much all it was) of the Manson murders was the eventual weird reason he managed this; we don't see enough growth leading up to this point and I would have liked to have seen much more of the cult's deranged activities.", "Interesting revisionist film about Mansion followers": "I thought it was good, but not good like you expect Tarantino's movies to be. I like DiCaprio and Pitt but this seemed more like a vanity project, than anything else. Great acting but no real storyline, just an opportunity for the director to reminiscence and have fun doing the thing he loves with people he enjoys working with. Not the worse but not a masterpiece either.", "Weird, but watchable. Better luck to QT on the next one. It captures an era, more 70s, but falls flat with a rewrite of history.": "I left the theater with this thought...\"I can't say anything bad about it, but I can't say anything good either\".I just re-watched Reservoir Dogs 2 days ago, one of my favs, sans the violence, for story and characters.This piece was like browsing the internet looking at pretty pictures. Without any real point. I've read \"meandering\" as a descriptive for the film and that about sums it up, the same as looking at random pictures, videos on the internet.Although I thought the closing scene, when they enter the wrong house, was well executed revenge -- if not, wishing things had been different than the reality. But it didn't really make any sense for the film, because the rest of the film was meant to be a realistic description of the era --- so for me, the candy coated fantasy -- seemed out of place.Woody Allen doesn't always get it right either, but he keeps making films, so should Tarantino. This is his passion. That shows in the film, weather you like it or not.Reservoir Dogs is an amazing film.QT had 93 million more to spend on this film, despite its flaws, it's still a watchable film, and a lesson to new film makers. Less money may make you a better film maker.It just dawned on me, this film doesn't really have any villains, and the ones you see a the end, are simply there by accident.Weird, but watchable. Better luck to QT on the next one.", "Simply bad...": "1 star would be the score if it wasn't for the song during credits...Jokes aside, this is a very \"empty\" movie. Random scenes mixed together", "Once upon a time . . 3 groups of people left the cinema before me": "I have loved Tarantino films in the past, but this is the worst film he has produced. Have no idea why it was rated 18 as for the first 1 hour 45 there was only swearing and 1 person got hit in the mouth\nPOSITIVES\nThere are a few funny jokes.\nThere is however a huge nostalgic reminder of the 60s , but that is it.\nIf the end of the film was any good, I can't tell you because like LOTS of others i didn't make it to the end.\nBrad Pitt was good and leonardo DiCaprio did a few great scenes. But sorry but this film was not worth the ticket price", "A pointless film": "As much as I admire Tarantino for many of his films, this one I can not digest. It is pointless. There is no story, no plot, just an endless parade of mostly unfunny sketches that end in one typical Tarantino blood drenched scene. A total waste of budget, time and talent of everyone involved. And to top it all he did not even have the decency to make a normal length film. He sadistically tortures the audience with boredom for almost 3 hours. I give it 3 stars only because of great cinematography, costumes, production design and acting, otherwise it would be 0.", "What coulda been...in Hollywood": "Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is an enigma of a movie. A bulk of the acting throughout is well done, but what else would you expect from the lineup provided. An opportunity is there for a memorable story. You just never really see one. Had you gone into this movie, well aware of the acting skill-set involved, but with little knowledge of the director's previous work, you'd likely come out saying, \"Not bad, but the director does have potential.\" Kinda a summary of the film; has potential. Some of the best acting scenes are of the actors \"acting\" within the movie. But they are drawn out. And in the end, have little to do with where the plot is going, which is a task to figure out itself. Many of the driving scenes are lifeless. Where in past Tarantinio works, like Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, that used this venue for witty dialogue and forums into character's minds. In the end Tarantino called this his love story to L.A. And no doubt the way in which 60's Hollywood is displayed is superb. But the story is sluggish. And when it wraps up in old school Tarantino style it's more like there was simply nothing left to tell. Problem being, not much had been told to us until then. In past Tarantino efforts you end up sorting through several scenes and sequences to pick out your favorites and most memorable. In ...Hollywood, you seem left still searching.", "An Expectations Crime": "I can't believe I wasted almost three hours of my life watching this movie... worst movie of the decade (I would watch Pixels three times before watching this garbage again)... also, terrible depiction of the hippie community... stupid and overrated. Don't pay to watch this nonsense", "Once Upon a Time in Hollyweird": "As the name implies, this is a story of people moving through the Hollywood lifestyle.The thriving actor, Rick, and his stunt double, Cliff are hitting their threshold within their careers of the late 60s TV media. The story plays out further with an inherent sense of ageism.Theres a lot of side characters, especially Margot Robbie, that add a lot of the Hollywood solidarity theme to the story.The Hollywood theme, that still imposes a strong influence to today's society, profoundly shows how a cult can self sustain itself - this one particularly being Charles Manson.Each character has their own self-battles and self-realization, while other's character-time end with them showing who they were in the beginning on their introduction.This relatively, linear story will pull you through a unique story of loyalty, dignity, ambition, and altruism.", "Good": "I like this movie but sometimes I m bored I think it's good enough", "Much Politics in the Shredder": "I knew little about the film and was honestly a little disappointed, and a little angry by the end. I did my first play in middle school in 1960, went into college theatre teaching, especially theatre and social justice, and have never been fond of theatre/film being about itself. So many films in the 30's about \"the theatah\", as if that's the only thing writers and directors understood. Which is probably right. I'm still unhappy with Chorus Line. But this one. If we're looking for new directions from the 1960's, Quentin, how about going to the six months from September 1964 to February 1965 and stop that friggin' war? That truly mattered and we're still suffering from it. Indeed, if you're going to make a film about \"the end of the great era of films\" (Quentin's determination, of course), why not make it about \"the beginning of a great era of film\" and black people finally getting some screen time in the early 70's -- Shaft, Super Fly, Lady Sings the Blues. And flashback to the magnificent Raisin in the Sun in 1961. Could Quentin's memory film have been any whiter? I'm very white but have earned black blood in my veins. So, too much white privileged navel gazing for me. Others may have a different experience. Which is probably the case.", "No spoilers, non needed.": "A huge disappointment for a Tarantino movie with all these huge stars.Although i am a huge Tarantino fan, the movie was boring to an unbearable extent that i was considering stopping it several times and watch something else to change the faul moot it has put me in.Too many stars but scattered storyline with nothing interesting, no challenging scenes that may display good acting.", "Enter the Revisionist": "Sharon Tate: her tragic story is imagined as a happy ending. Bruce Lee: his story is tragically smeared as a sad imagining. Hopefully, viewers will understand that QT brings a dream in the former and a nightmare in the latter. He treats an OK actress Tate with respect, but disses an film and martial arts icon -- whom Mike Tyson called \"A killer\" (speaking as a street fighter, and not as an actor; Sugar Ray Leonard: \"Look in the dictionary the word icon. That's Bruce Lee....\" Leonard developed his jab from watching Lee's movies. Manny Pacquiao: \"My hero.\" This is just pulpy fiction. Morever, QT has even suggested in interviews that in real life Lee would lose to a special forces fighter. Tell that to special operators who revere Lee. The founder of SEAL Team Six definitely respects Lee and his art. He met with a Lee second generation student: \"I couldn't do anything with him. I was black and blue.... and I signed up for private lessons.\" When Lee was alive he took on all comers. He lived in Los Angeles, the hotbed of martial arts champions at the time. The great Dan Inosanto says, \"I saw Bruce spar with the best of the era, the champions. He was in a different class. I never saw him spar with Joe Lewis, but someone who I respect told me that he saw Bruce and Joe spar, and it was like Ali (Bruce) against a Golden Gloves boxer, strictly no contest.\" Linda Lee has said, \"I saw Bruce spar with Chuck Norris and Joe Lewis at the same time, and he made them look like children.\" Stirling Silliphant, Oscar winner and former fencer: \"Bruce gave me a real knife and told me to stick him. I was playing at first, but then I found that I couldn't touch him. He kicked me at will, my hands, my legs, my head!\" QT missed a great film opportunity to show us the real Bruce Lee's incredible skill. Finally, a martial arts writer: \"Bruce was 15 feet away, and I didn't see him move in before it was too late. He slapped my head and was back 15 feet away. He did this again and again, and there was nothing I could do. When I met him I thought he didn't look like a tough guy. I grew up in East L. A., so I thought I knew what a tough guy looked like.\" After all these years all we get in film is a fake Bruce Lee and a fake Lee narrative. When will we see a talented filmmaker with the real icon?", "Without Brad, it's 5 stars at best.": "Firstly, I love Tarantino films, that's why it pains me to write this review.Basically the film depicts a Hollywood that once was, the lifestyle, the scenery, and we get to follow a select few lives and routines.\nPlease don't take the above literally, as the story line is non existent and flits back and forth amongst these individuals, with some sections making barely any sense.\nThis was the second time I've attempted to watch this film, due to the fact boredom kicked in and I couldnt stomach anymore. That being said, watch the film for Brad Pitt's scenes.\nWithout Pitt, I wouldve given up yet again on this film.\nIf you're looking for laughs and action, this film isn't for you, if you wish to time travel and get a glimpse of the celebrity struggles at the higher end of the spectrum, then go for it, just don't have high hopes....", "A Movie About Everything, Yet Nothing": "A very entertaining movie, but ultimately: Is it a character study about a drunken, fading actor wrestling with alcoholism and suicidal thoughts? Kind of. Maybe. Is it a probing, suspenseful insight into the coalescing of the Manson family? Kind of. Maybe. Is it an homage to the glorious late-1960s of Hollywood and LA? Kind of. Maybe. Is it a tale about a really cool stuntman and his kick-ass dog? Probably.So, there you have it. Very long, but a very entertaining movie because DiCaprio is naturally fantastic and Brad Pitt's character is so likable. Inevitably, it degenerates into a gorefest, as expected from a Tarantino movie. It wanted to be about everything, however, and ultimately wound up being about nothing.", "QT can't write anymore": "I've always been a HUGE fan of Terentino. I hated The Hateful Eight and even more so, this movie.\nNo plot; anything worth watching was in the last 15 minutes of this movie.\nQT-youre a has-been!!!! Stop while Django is still in my head.", "i've stopped into the 1h mark": "Oh my...\nwhere to start?\nPLEASE STOP WITH THIS CRAP FILMS!!!!!!!", "Disappointing.": "I was very excited to watch this film and had high hopes for it. Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is good but lacks abit of drive. But the main problem I have with this film is that I feel like the first half of the film and the second half (when Rick and Cliff return to Hollywood) just don't match up and the film heads in a complete opposite direction and becomes silly unnecessarily, which I felt came down to the film trying to be comical. Therefore I did feel as if Tarantino tried to hard to make it comical and it just felt forced slightly, this applies more towards the end of the film and although I do say this certain parts of the film did make me laugh. Personally if Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood had took a different direction than the way it did and was more of a real, serious, drama driven story then I believe it would of be a better film.Overall though, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is a good enjoyable film and worth a watch.", "I really wanted to like it, but...": "I remember the first time I saw the trailer. I got really hyped about it because it looked so good, AND it's a film by Quentin Tarantino. But the movie couldn't live up to the fantastic trailer. The only good thing about this movie? The performances by the cast, especially by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Also, the cinematography is great.However, nothing else really is good about this movie. The story, I mean the stories keep going parallel to each other. Random subplots kept popping up and confusing incidents keep happening. You keep waiting for something interesting to happen but nothing does. Margot Robbie's character has nothing to do with Leo's or Brad's other than living in Leo's house next door.Despite those flaws, you don't really get bored because you keep waiting for the climax where all of these might come together and make sense, but it never happens. The climax is typical Tarantino blood, violence and extreme gory, which was probably the most exciting part of the movie.One thing I wanted to mention that this movie has the worst editing during one scene, on any movie I have ever seen. When Tim Olyphant's character meets Leo for the first time, they just cut out two of Tim's dialogs, and I was astonished to see how terribly it was edited out.There are so many positive reviews of this film. Most of them are definitely NOT paid reviews. But this is my first. I haven't felt like wasting almost three hours of my life watching any other movie since Frozen.", "Painfully weak story punctuated by absurdist and gratuitous violence.": "There's no denying Tarantino's success as creative artist and film industry player, and I give him all due respect. Having said that, this project does not succeed from a cinematic perspective. It's a bloated and meandering story that, in the end, does not justify the time we spent together. An over the top violence and death scene near the end only made me feel disgusted and used. I don't often feel compelled to write a film review, but I am motivated to call out this film project as a (highly) profitable creative failure. It's a shame to think of what could have been done with that $90,000,00. Take some time to re-engage - re-edit and re-release a new and improved \"Director's Cut\" that's shorter, more focused, and more entertaining.", "Shoulda been a TV series.": "I think this was a missed opportunity by Tarantino. Instead of a 2hr 40 min movie, he shouldve comitted to a series : Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Then and only then it would've been eaten up by the general public, and heck even me.Everything about the movie screams episodic journey, and not a single sit-through. A great, genius even cinematography, but a missed opportunity to be something more. Much more.", "Classic QT": "I expected a Terantino movie and that's exactly what I got. Multiple story lines, great acting and the good ol' build up without nowing whether it leads to something or not. I think most people are used to and expect movies to start and end in the same way no matter what movie it is, and so it's perfectly normal to have so many disappointed viewers. I think these movies step away from the expected and allows us to focus more on other aspects of cinematography. I personally enjoyed it very much and I'm sure many of you will also", "Save your precious time": "And remember these brilliant actors by their good roles!! They had no integrity making this movie!\nPeople were leaving the cinema before the end.

Tarantino, you are a joke and so are all the people who like his movies.", "Pure muck!": "Big Tarantino fan but this film does not hit the mark whatsoever. The story goes nowhere, too slow and boring. Brad Pitt character is interesting alright and if I was just about him and the hippies and the usual Tarantino magic it could have been good. Leo's character didn't do anything at all, so disappointing!", "Are we entering the realm of strangenism?": "Didn't see much of a point in the whole thing. Had a hard time watching until the end. Seems like the whole purpose of the movie was to make cool killing scenes. Not sure why he killed half the people he killed really.", "One of Quint's best": "Once Upon a Time...in Burbank, I watched the new Quentin Tarantino film. Best choice ever. Never a dull moment when watching his stuff, especially if it's almost 3 hours long. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the best things he's made and it shows. You can tell everything he put in there meant a lot to him, much more of a personal film than the others. If Tarantino retires, we're out of one of the few brilliant directors left in this industry. He always has the best editing, the best soundtracks, cinematography and the most interesting stories. Everything is a straight up love letter to classic Hollywood and to all the stuff that Tarantino grew up with and inspired him. Lots of fun to see films like that, with period cars and locations from a bygone era to remind you of the simpler times. Tarantino also has the best casts, and no exception here. As good as DiCaprio is, seeing Luke Perry in there makes me think how interesting he would have been as the lead. It's definitely one of his more interesting films, with a great story and timeline, and it gets pretty downright funny, scary and over the top at the same time. Lots of scenes with great tension and classic Tarantino tropes, which are very fun to watch. The ending is by far one of the most entertaining things I've watched in a long time, and he put in one of the most satisfying twists ever. It's so good, and so refreshing to see something like this, a real \"film\" film, that takes it's time, has an amazing script and makes you feel a lot of different things. That's true cinema.

Since then, his films have become uneven at best. Gone are the snappy dialogue, the unexpected plot twists, the moments of visionary splendor.What we have in their place is Tarantino showing off his command of moivie trivia and what he has in his record collection. He seems to even have forgotten the importance of plot, and he certainy doesn't care about history. The story takes a long time to end up nowhere. It could easily have been an hour shorter.Tarantino is promising to stop after the next one. If \"Hollywood\" is any indication of what's next, we should all be grateful.", "Beautiful testament to retro Hollywood... for 2 boring hours.": "I can see what the film is trying to do, but it kills its audience with boredom in the process.

I was happy that he chose not to glorify Charles Manson and his groupies, giving them a more suitable ending which was just fine with me.There were so many bits and pieces in this film that I really enjoyed, but I am sorry to say the overall story kind of fell flat for me. The film was long and in general I am happy to go along with Tarantino on his journeys, but I struggled to find anyone in this film that I cared about...except maybe the dog?Underage sex, mariticide, drugs, a murdering cult, and finally a touch of Tarantino's gratuitous violence. As much as I enjoyed seeing the Manson situation go down like it did...I think there are far more interesting Hollywood stories to tell, even ones with violent endings.Still love Tarantino, but this would not make the top of my list nor be a recommendation from me.", "A plodding fairy tale saved by extraordinary acting performances": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is one of the Quentin Tarantino movies that is the most difficult to describe. Usually, there are movies of his that convince with atmosphere, depth and twists such as Inglorious Basterds or films that are rather shallow, referential and confusing like Kill Bill. The only movie that is somewhere in between both extremes might be Jackie Brown that convinces with great acting and cool retro atmosphere but disappoints with unnecessary lengths and a weak story. This new movie could be compared to Jackie Brown.The acting performances, especially by a very cool Brad Pitt and a vividly emotional Leonardo DiCaprio, are absolutely outstanding. Without the two brilliant main actors, this movie would have been painfully average but the strong acting performances make it a good movie, neither more nor less. The movie truly manages to capture the spirit of the end of the golden age of Hollywood with numerous references to popular television series and movies such as The Green Hornet and Rosemary's Baby. The movie cleverly mixes facts and fiction.However, the movie clearly overstays its welcome with a running time of one hundred sixty-one minutes. The film takes more than two hours to introduce all characters and settings until the climax unfolds in about ten minutes. While most of Quentin Tarantino's movies have a clever twist, the one used here is slightly disappointing at first contact but at least offers some food for thought in hindsight. This is the kind of movie that grows on you as you think about it later on while it slightly disappoints while watching it.This movie should be recommended to those who are either interested in the history of the American film industry or admire Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio who would both deserve Academy Awards for their extraordinary performances. The movie however has massive lengths and an almost unspectacular story. It's worth being watched at the cinema but overall slightly overrated due to the massive critical acclaim any Quentin Tarantino movie seems to receive.", "Nobody beat the s**t out of Bruce.": "Pitt is once again the hero administering ultra violence on the perpetrators of some of history's most heinous crimes.", "The least Tarantino of Tarantino's films.": "If you think Reservoir Dogs is great, then you'll probably hate this movie.If you think Fellini, Truffaut, and Leone are great directors, then you'll probably love this movie.'Hollywood' is Tarantino's most mature film, and over time, it will be regarded as his best with Pulp Fiction.", "My Personal Favourite of Tarantino": "Oh my God. What a movie. A cinematically breathtaking achievement of flawless writing, acting, stellar directing and visuals. I adored every minute of this movie, and its mesmerizing characters, Cliff Booth, and Rick Dalton, played by Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio respectively. And boy oh boy do they both bring their entire passion into it, with some of the best performances they've ever had. This has to probably be my favourite movie of Tarantino, because even though his other movies are undoubtedly great, Once Upon a Time has something which they didn't have..heart..pure heart. It's actually heartwarming, the beautiful cinematography of 60s Hollywood and it's love letter to the age, the beautiful, unshakeable friendship between Dalton and Booth, and you finish feeling actually happy. Easily one of the best movies of the year, 10/10", "Duller than a dial tone and more boring than a chinese phone book": "Seriously, if you go to your local DMV office and sit there for three hours you'll have the time of your life compared to this utter trash!", "Bloody hippies!": "I'm a person that doesn't like to watch movie trailers, so I had no idea what to expect from this movie.

I've been binging on his movies these last few days building up to this movie, I wasn't disappointed.Give it a watch purely for that ending!", "slow start": "At beginning everything seemed wrong both Leo and Bradd.But while movie progressed u started to ignore Leos acting witch was awkward seemed like he didnt know how to work with Bradd.I didint like the old movie western filming parts eather but i dont like western in any terms.They didnt take too much of an time and movie continued nicely.Story started to roll and u ignored all the minor things.I enjoyed the ending nothing was left unsolved i hate those endings and the pitbull was the best thing ever.Im so happy just because i gave this movie a second chance need to do that more often maybe ive missed loads of good movies.", "Really boring movie!": "I hate that this movie took so much Time of my life!!!!! Really the people going crazy 7.9 of 10 for this movie why???? I can say 2 of 1000 because maybe I'm saying maybe it's possible somebody to make it worse than this movie ! How it's possible to have some of best actors in the world and to make this movie!!!?????!!!!", "Retro Magic": "Quentin Tarantino shines here where many others would fail. He captured the very flavor of 1960's Hollywood, down to the opening Columbia Pictures' projection opening of that time. He also channeled the slower pace of that period.Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and other screen icons make for a flawless portrayal of aging talents, compromising on work they would ordinarily turn down, just to stay in the game.The memorial of Sharon Tate was tasteful, keeping her character as a minor, supporting role and Margot Robbie hit that ball out of the park with her haunting portrayal. Julia Butters was a precocious as ever Trudi Fraser and a refreshing character among the older actors.Tarantino's thirst for blood seemed to be under control, until the last scenes, where he wrote an ending that many would have preferred to what actually did happen.", "Fun ending": "This is not one of Tarantino's best. Yet the ending makes the long wait worth it.", "Once Upon a Time ...in Nothing Happens": "Where do I start... I love Tarantino, love DiCaprio and love Pitt. Thought this film was going to be amazing! Oh how I was wrong, or for better use of a word...bewildered. Nothing happens until 15 minutes from the end, really, nothing happens. It's just a load of great cinematography, great sets, great costumes and great acting but is that really enough to entertain? I suppose it is for some, hence the great reviews but personally I watch movies to be entertained and unfortunately I was not. It's slow and boring. However it does some how seem to drag you in and keep you watching. I guess that's just the suspense and hope that something will actually happen. What a shame.", "All that for last 40 to 45 minutes?!?!": "2 hours of fluff (and I'm being nice!) where I actually went to social media several times! Then you get to the last 45 minutes or so that had me on the edge of my seat but made no sense and I'm not sure to understand how or if it was connected to the first 2 hours of fluff!", "Tarantino vanity project?": "I lasted to halfway, 1hr 20mins. Great cast but no discernible plot. Poor excuse of a film.", "WASTE OF DI CAPRIO AND PITT TALENT": "This is the stupidest movie I've ever seen, a total waste of talent of two actors and a waste of my time. Just because you have two great actors doesn't necessarily mean it's a great movie. We got our money back and left. Don't waste your money or your time, trust me.", "20 Minutes...": "Just watch the last 20 minutes of the movie. It is enough. The 2.5 hours before are boring as hell", "Self indulgent, long and pointless": "Put it this way, I remember who I was with, the date and time, that I saw the premiere of Pulp Fiction. What a waste of time this movie is. If any other person had written this, Hollywood would have never made it. And they shouldn't have.", "Familiar story": "Inventive retelling of a sad story in an alternate reality. Brad Pitt deserved best supporting actor!", "Not like earlier films": "I understand Mr Tarantino's nostalgia, but I'm not sure why we the public had to subscribe to it. I hope this is his first and last vanity film. Brad Pitt looks good for his age and fans of his will enjoy his role in this. DiCaprio proves he can act. Is the age of Westerns and old Los Angeles really that romantic? If you think it is then this is for you. Nothing much happens in Once Upon A Time, and all the tension, such as there is, is provided by prior knowledge of what Charlie Manson's terrible acolytes did later. In this movie Tarantino has garnered the indie formula of a huge 90% build-up (relying on the actors to deliver interesting drama), to 10% monster ending, only his ratio is 5%.", "Absolute Brilliance": "The ever ingenious Quentin Tarantino does it again with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. How can a filmmaker be so brilliant? After all he writes and directs all his movies, but the way he conjured this one up, completely astonished me. You never know what is going to happen, no predictability whatsoever. After watching this last night, I was totally speechless. To sum it up here, this is Incredible!", "A Classic!!": "Enjoyed every bit of it. It's a classic film and not like every other mainstream movie. But yes you have to have an aptitude for such a film which has a lot of drama. Might not be for everyone.\nDiCaprio, Pitt & Tarantino at their best as always!! Awesome work!!", "Decent movie but will never re-watch": "Amazing acting with great cast but the story is simply wayyy too long and drawn out with no real purpose and with a few completely useless characters.", "Stuck in 2nd gear": "Just seemed like the movie starts off ok introducing characters swimming in the late 60s vibe but just seems to float along aimlessly ,with all that talent and sound track at its disposal kind of a disappointment", "Ridiculous movie": "Do not expect anything from it. And don't expect anything to happen as it will not.", "Thrilling and hilarious": "The title evokes well-known western films and we follow western actors throughout the film. It also evokes the stories of the west as told by the whites. The real story is different. This is also what happens in this film. But when you know the real story, you much prefer Tarantino's difference. Tarantino also made a similar change in another of his films set during World War II.The fact that the reality of the story is gruesome and bloody makes us think that Tarantino would do it as is. He does bloody well instead which really help us make it through. We follow several real-life characters that we are glad to see and his depictions are charming... except for the bad guys.", "Tremendous Work": "I haven't seen a Hollywood movie in a theater in 20 years. Most of what gets produced and makes money since the advent of CGI and the entire Marvel.DC/sci-fi/fantasy genre as the only thing that makes money for studios, leaves me cold. But I made a point of seeing this. Yes, it was long. Yes, it moved slowly in parts. Yes, there were scenes that made you wonder why he included them. Yes, there was gratuitous violence in parts. All that is typical Tarentino. But this is so good otherwise. The sets, the wardrobe, the throwbacks everywhere. It is glorious. If anything I wished he had shown us even more of the L.A. street scenes that the production designers so brilliantly rebuilt. I'm not a DeCaprio fan, and this started out with me not liking his character, but by the end I got him. Pitt is great throughout. Margot Robbie is simply sweet and adorable. Julia Butters' scenes with DiCaprio are lovely. Margaret Qualley does a fine job as one of the Manson gang. It is likely the only film released this year that I will see this year. I may catch a handful of others later on, but since Hollywood doesn't make movies for people like me these days, it's no loss. But I had to see this, and I'm glad I did.", "Great Film But The Ending Is Just Too Risky": "My Real Score : 8.5/10\"Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood is another great piece from Quentin Tarantino that i have a big problem in the end, we all know Tarantino imagination was ridiculous but great, example: Inglourious Basterds with Hitler got killed in the theater and of course we all know Hitler didn't die like that because first Hitler was a very famous person so if Tarantino don't wanna tell the real story and what really happen is alright, in this one Tarantino wanna make a twisted story about the night Sharon Tate was murdered by adding Leonardo Dicaprio and Brad Pitt character, the problem is nobody really know who is Sharon Tate is, maybe some older people know her, but what i'm afraid is a teenagers nowadays who didn't know who she is, is gonna believe what happened in the movie, if Tarantino at least give a narration in the end or a description about what really happened, that could be better, besides that the movie was still great, again the first hour of the movie was alright, the perfomance w as amazing, the cinematography, the old 1950s and 60s editing was great, overall Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood was still a great film but the ending is just too risky\"", "(The first film I walked out of before it ended obviously)": "There used to be plots. Characters that the audience could invest in.\nDon't get me wrong the cinematography was spot on.\nNice production values and set design.\nVery Good \"Acting\" from the leads but the child star may have stole the show, granted it was technically a tie between her and the Brad Pitt's Pit bull terrier, but the dog won as it had more purpose.Walked out of the movie after before the ninety minute mark as I was thoroughly bored.Reminds me of that scene from Planes, Trains and Automobiles, where Steve Martin talks about John Candy's anecdotes,\"\nHoney I'd like you to meet Del Griffith. He's got some amusing anecdotes. Here's a gun so you can blow your brains out. You'll thank me for it.\"\n\"I could tolerate any insurance seminar, for days I could sit there and listen to them going on and on with a big smile on my face\"-\"How can you stand it?\"\"Because I've been with Del Griffith\"\nWhen you're telling a story, have a point. It makes it so much interesting for the listener.Now I truly know how Steve Martin's character felt.Tarantino was obviously messing with the audience by having us watch the making of the Western Show (pretending to be meta and all that guff).Uninteresting anecdotes. Check.\nUnfinished or events of non closure told in flashbacks to ransom the audience. Check.\nUnnecessary scenes. (Party in the playboy mansion (sans nudite), buying an expensive first edition of a book, repairing a tv aerial) Check.\nGlorification of smoking. Check.\nFoot/Shoe fetishism. Check.\nWatching scenes from older movies in a movie \"The Wrecking Crew\" as a vain effort to be meta or break the fourth wall. Check.Undoubtedly, I am sure that all the Tarantino fans/sycophants will of course down-vote this review. Regrettably I am not in the habit of drinking the cool-aid so to speak.Hope that Jerry Seinfeld sues him for ripping off his idea of comedians in car getting coffee. Minus the coffee, comedy and any significant dialogue.\nI've heard and engaged in better conversations whilst in a dentist's chair.Dull, pointless and disrespecting Bruce Lee was very uncool and unnecessary on so many levels.Thank goodness it is his last film.Pity that he could have retired a lot sooner.", "Surprisingly wholesome": "I loved the ending so much! Great choice of actors, wholesome plot twist.", "A terrible movie with a great cast": "I am interested in the art of cinema, my profession is film production.

A flop.We need a 0 star score for this.", "Tarantino Thinks He Knows Bruce Lee...": "In his interview with Rogan, Tarantino claimed that Bruce Lee had \"nothing but disrespect for stuntmen\" while on the set of the TV show \"The Green Hornet,\" citing Matthew Polly's book, \"Bruce Lee: A Life.\" But Polly denied his book conveyed such a message, tweeting that Lee was not disrespectful, but rather had a different \"fight choreography philosophy and style\" and had aimed to change American flight choreography \"so that the blows would miss by millimeters rather than by feet\" and banged up some stuntmen in the process.Yeah I've lost all respect for this white washed nonsense, I'm more of a Bruce Lee fan than Tarantino, at least Bruce was original and Tarantino just rips off other films, homage or not to the spaghetti westerns and other films; Tarantino is just a wash out has been saying anything to get white boy himself attention.Worst film ever by the way. The portrayal of Bruce Lee is insulting.", "Too long and not my style": "Although Brad Pitt was looking mighty fine, was disappointed. Felt like the plot was all over the place", "Not one of his best efforts...": "It's almost like he couldn't make up his mind and he decided to make two movies neither of which really worked. The stories mesh in the end but the storyline is flimsy and disjointed. In addition to being too long and slow with too far too much exposition. Lacks the imagination and spark of his other films. Good liking film that ultimate falls flat.", "I am not watching a movie for the last 15 minutes.": "A very slow paced, many people would consider as boring movie except the last 15 Minutes. We are just waiting and it happens nothing. Bruce Lee's portrayal is an insult to all Martial Art fans and Bruce Lee's family. I think that Tarantino probably spent a day with Bruce Lee, otherwise he would not put his name in the dirt. Leonardo DiCaprio is playing like always Leonardo DiCaprio. Margot Robbie as always just pointing with her look. Brad Pitt cool as always.", "Leonardo good, Brad great, movie Excellent.": "Never been a fan of Brad Pitt, but he was great in this - a perfect part for him. DiCaprio was also excellent in what was a great script. One of those rare long movies that keeps you interested throughout and ends as strongly as it started. That movies as good as this, Jo Jo Rabbit and Ford versus Ferrari lost out in the Oscars to the appallingly bad Parasite is just an utter joke.", "I don't know what genre it is.": "Tarantino's films are unique. How unique? You have to be a good listener to enjoy his movies. His films usually lost their points, or they never have their points. It seems like his movies' story are always bended into various unrelated directions. For this one, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, it looks like a documentary with drama that the story telling was comparable to a man who was lost in a forest. Thus, watching his films, you must be very patient.", "not a typical qt film": "What I want to see in a qt' film? Whose things were exciting, unexpected plots with over the edge performance by a group of strong roles. Maybe violence and spicy monologue.\nI didn't get these in this film, until last 20 minutes, but the rest two hours + just simply boring and incoherent.\nThe worst of all of his works.", "A movie insider": "The movie seems to have a slow movement. Its all about the happenings inside the European film industries. Only thing enjoyable is acting of Leonardo Decaprio and Brad pit. And Bruce Lee scene was interesting.", "Sort of \"A Mighty Wind\" meets \"Sunset Boulevard\": An Homage to B-Films": "Quentin Tarantino has for his last few film projects created a new sub-genre, sort of historical-fantasy dark comedy. Tarantino takes aim with \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" at trashy films and television, directed more towards buffs of bad cinema than the public at large. There's lots of in-jokes, particularly a bunch of fictional movie posters which capture the culture of 1969. My favorite is \"Uccidimi subito Ringo dicce il Gringo\", a supposed Italian-Western/Spaghetti Western\", which translates as \"Kill me now Ringo says the Gringo\", staring Rick Dalton, the fictional movie and television actor played by Leonardo diCaprio.However, at the risk at giving anything away, this film is a fantasy with references to the entertainment culture of that time. During this time, from the late 1960's to circa 1980, there were lots of \"Once Upon a Time...\" movies: \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", \"Once Upon a Time in America\", etc., most of them made by Tarantino's hero, Sergio Leone. So this is also in part a homage to Leone. Lots of actor-characters from the period have cameos, such as Bruce Lee and Steve McQueen, the latter played by Damian Lewis in a brilliant bit of casting. (Ryan Gosling also might have played the part.) McQueen appears in only one scene but that one alone is worth the price of admission. There's even a sequence where Dalton relates he might have had the part which ultimately went to Steve McQueen! That also is worth the price of admission.The story centers on Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), an actor in Hollywood whose career is somewhat on the skids. At the beginning of the film, we learn Dalton had been in a fairly successful television show called \"Bounty Law\" of the late 1950's to 1961. (\"Law\" may be a send-up of a very popular show of the time called \"Have Gun Will Travel\" about an investigator/bounty hunter for hire in the Old West, called Paladin.) It's now eight years after the final season, and Dalton is mainly getting guest spots on TV shows where he plays the heavy, i.e. The villain. A Hollywood insider played by Al Pacino tells him that since he's playing only villains as a guest star, his career as a leading man be over. He's gotten another guest star spot in the pilot of a new western televisions series.Brad Pitt plays Cliff Booth, a stuntman and Dalton's gopher, accused of having murdered his wife several years back. Much of the film switches back and forth between the two. I give Pitt a lot of credit being willing to play a character who resided in the shadows of recognized Hollywood actors. Stunt men and stand-in's are those in the industry who get almost no credit for what they do, and yet are crucial to a film's success.Until about the last forty-five minutes, the film doesn't really have a story arc. It's more like a series of funny incidences which poke fun at Hollywood culture. Almost from the beginning, Hollywood has always had its share of really cheesy sub-par movies and TV shows, and this appears to be Tarantino's version of a somewhat trashy film designed to poke fun at the world of more or less tasteless films and television shows from the late 1960's, and the ridiculous behavior of the participants in entertainment.On the darker side, \"Once Upon a Time\" references one of the most brutal crimes in Hollywood history, the murder of Sharon Tate, actress and newly-wed wife of director Roman Polanski, and several of her friends at the hands of members of Charles Manson's cult. About two-thirds into the film, Booth visits the Charles Manson cult hideaway and it looks much like the movie set in which Dalton is playing a guest star part. A movie not for all tastes but can be added to a movie about movies, such as \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"Hail Caesar\", the latter written and directed by the Cohen Brothers.", "Worst Tarantino movies": "Never saw worst movie, idea, stupidity in a movie!", "I'm the one with the big mouth...": "Here's The Lowedown on \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" (R - 2019 - Blu)Genre: Comedy/Action\nMy Score: 8.7Cast=10 Acting=9 Plot=7 Ending=10 Story=8\nFunny=7 Chemistry=9 Script=10 Violent=8 F/X=9A faded television actor and his stunt double strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry during the final years of Hollywood's Golden Age in 1969 Los Angeles.\"You're the one with the big mouth, and I would really enjoy closing it, especially in front of all my friends.\" Unlike most folks, I am not a Tarantino fan. When I say I liked this film, it's not because I love all of his films....but this came together really well for me. I did have some pace issues in the middle, but I held on for the great ending.

For a good time, give this a watch...I'm gonna write that on the bathroom wall right now.", "What is this crap?": "If you want to lose 2.5 hours of your life, than go watch this junk of a movie. This movie is so boring that I started watching the ceiling after the first hour. There is no plot, you start to wonder what in the hell you're doing in there after the second hour and the last 30 minutes are just agony. Seriously, this is by far the worst movie I've ever seen! What I don't understand is how did he convinced these really good actors to play in this joke of a movie? Please, do yourself a favor and don't watch this garbage.", "Visually appealing": "Firstly, the costumes and sets are stunning. This film is so visually pleasant. The cast is also enjoyable, particularly a large number of cameos of recognisable Hollywood A and B Listers. But, and it's a big but, my god it's about 2 hours of nothing and 20 mins of classic Tarantino at the end.I'm glad the \"twist\" at the end tied it altogether, because up until that point I couldn't make the connection between the two storylines. Both of which were so boring you could hardly call them stories.If you're going to subject yourself to this film have your phone fully charged and handy coz you'll undoubtedly find yourself googling \"Sharon Tate\" \"Manson Family Murders\" and \"Spaghetti Westerns\" throughout to kill the time.Meh.", "Zzzzzzz.......Zzzzzzzzz.......": "I love QT's movies, but this movie was boring. Yea, the last 9 minutes got my attention, but we already know what happened. The movie was just a montage of famous dead people......over and over....Too much use of time and space. A very odd narrative.I didn't care about any of the characters.Anyway, good cinematography....Peace and Love!", "WASTE OF TIME": "What exactly was the point of this movie? From what I can gather, it's a collection of relatively unrelated mini stories that somehow compose something having to do with Hollywood, a subject I find so utterly boring it terrifies me to think I may have to see yet another pile of trash whining about how hard it is to get by in Hollywood... oh the nightmare! Tarentino is really bad filmmaker. I have no idea why anyone likes his work. Occasionally he does something OK, but everything he does feels like the same old thing he always does. This one's a little different because it is not amusing in any way. Watch it because you know you want to because for some reason you give Tarentino a pass and treasure everything he vomits out. But try to really watch it so you can ask yourself if this really is the legend everyone seems to be claiming it is. The most amusing part about it is writing a bad review after having to suffer through it. It gets 2 whopping stars because some parts are decently done. I'm not trying to rip it apart just because I don't like the movie. But 2 is as fair as I can be with this one. I wouldn't leave it on as background noise when I am home alone.", "What a Disappointment!": "Typical Tarantino movie with all his quirks. Leonardo Dicaprio did a fantastic acting job! The overall plot was very slow moving and disappointing!", "What just happened?": "All-star cast. Tremendous acting, especially from Leo. Plot twist that you don't see coming...How can a movie have all those things and still manage to be terrible? QT found a way. There way 2.5 hours of random scenes not tired to any particular story line not building any suspense. No action. No drama. Not funny. Then a classic terrantino fight scene. This movie should have been a short. Only needed to be about 20 minutes long, but I guess that wouldn't have let terrantino take shots at Bruce Lee and take us through Cinema history.", "Tarantino needs to quit": "The washed-up Tarantino hasn't made a good movie in over 20 years. It's time to hang it up. This was just the nail in the coffin of his career. At least it should be.", "Quentin has arrived.": "If you're expecting a classic reboot of Pulp Fiction, well it was almost close enough but this movie was quite something else. But OUTH was a whole new experience of its own. It builds up the scenes as expected from Quentin's movies. Major shout out to Brad Pitt for being such a bad ass. Like god damn, he shone through the movie. Can't deny Leo's acting, it was out of this world. Nobody can do it like him. All in all, including the humor, the way he focuses on food, drinks and feet lol classic stuff. Gotta give it to Quentin, he didn't miss out on them details. You never know what to expect with his movies and quite frankly even if this movie a bit stretched out, I'm glad. It was definately worth watching it.", "The last 10 minutes was somewhat worth it": "Hell was it boring for most of the movie, but the last 10 minutes or so made up for a lot of the agony in waiting FOR SOMETHINGI mean ANYTHING to happen.", "Tarantino lost his Rhythm and Soul": "I love Tarantino movies, but this is his worst (well maybe not as bad as Four Rooms, but I count that out). Why? Its not because some people complain about a \"conservative standpoint\". I dont think that Tarantino is putting the hippies into a bad view -- Manson was a racist, so showing his family as a strange bunch of people is fine.But what I was missing about the 2 Hours and 40 Minutes was the humor of the old Tarantino movies, I missed the rhythm of the scenes, the rhythm of the dialogues, the depth of the characters, the slow burning drama. Al Pacino and Bruce Dern are wasted. For two ours its a mess of scenes that lead to nowhere, only the final 20 minutes or so he heats up the pace with a nice surprising finale, but before that? Pit has two Tarantino-like very humorous scenes, one with Bruce Lee and another one feeding his dog, but the rest lacks chemistry.Maybe he tries to copy that B-Movies he adores so much, but I think this doesnt work out, because he is lacking the drama and the humor at the same time. Many scenes just lead to nothing, they dont built upon each other, like the one with the 8-year old girl. There is no Christoph Walz and no Samuel Jackson in here and Pit -- though he is trying -- cant replace them. DiCaprio is just a shadow of himself, he cant decide where his character wants to go. If you want to see a movie about Hollywood, watch Robert Altmanns The Player or Cronenbergs Maps to the Stars instead.", "Pitt yes Movie no": "What was the point of this movie? I almost walked out before it was over because I thought I was going to die of boredom. There was no story at all. It was like watching a bunch of scenes that didn't quite mean anything. By the end I was convinced that Tarantino only made this movie so he could get together with his favorite people on set and have fun. I saw the film with other people and they all felt the same way. To put it bluntly, except for Pitt's watch-ability and maybe a moment or two from Decaprio, this film stunk. Other people pretend to be falling all over themselves to praise Once Upon A Time, which leads me to wonder if we saw the same film. Sure, different people like different movies but this is not really a movie. There is no story. It's just a collection of scenes that were edited too long. I really wanted to love this movie since, as we all know, the state of film making in America is in the trash and has been for a couple of decades. All we have is special effects. Story telling is dead in America. We wait for film makers in other countries to come up with good stories then we rip them off.. I was counting on Tarantino to deliver something that only he is capable of doing. He has his own special brand that says \"Tarantino\" but this movie of his, well, it kind of explains why he is planning on retiring. He made some very good movie that he can be proud of but this one is sad. It shows that he is out of steam. I wish him well and I will always speak highly of him as film film maker and a film fan but when I list the films that he has made, I will purposely leave this one off the list.", "This is a masterpiece": "You can feel the love of cinema in it.

The real-life event and historical characters including Tate and Manson family & Tarantino's own story and fictional characters including Rick and Cliff. Trarantino deals with two sides very equally in time, significance, and quality (50:50 situation). However, because they have same amount of force, they crash into each other rather than making synergy. Two narratives are separated from each other lacking links and go back and forth in unorganized and meaningless way. The right approach would have been reducing Rick's story since the western movie replica which has Rick as an actor is unnecessarily long and being merged into the main story line (Tate) as a sub story line (Rick).All left after the movie is feel-good nostalgic images and curiosity to look up what actually happened. Researching actual event was way more interesting and reading the book that fully develop Tarantino's imagination and creativity was more absorbing. However, the movie version failed.P. S Warning!!! As always, Quentin's use of violence in the movie is more than it needs to be.", "I Remember It Well.": "I was only 10 years old when actress Sharon Tate and her unborn child Paul Richard Polanski, along with friends Jay Sebring, Steven Parent, Wojciech Frykowski, and Abigail Folger (heiress to the Folger's Coffee fortune) were brutally murdered in 1969 by Charles Manson and his followers. But I remember it well. Partly because my dad watched the evening news every night when I was growing up. And the white, bold lettering and red background of LIFE Magazine often graced our living room coffee table along with the newspaper. But I remember it more so because just a year later, the Charles Manson murder trial would take place. It was The Trial of the Century until OJ Simpson. It was in newspapers and on the TV news every night. It lasted for six months and spilled over into 1971. I was one of those geeky kids who thought it was important to stay up on current affairs. I still do.Like father, like son.I read the book Helter Skelter by Lead Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi when it first came out. There would be other accounts as well over the years. And over the next five decades would have to see Manson's twisted face in the news every time he came up for parole. In other words, you kind of feel an attachment. Going so far as posting a remembrance last year on social media of a very beautiful and very pregnant Sharon Tate for it being 50 years since the senseless slayings.Quentin Tarantino has made a fictional movie molded around a non-fictional story. The way he pulls it off is nothing less than brilliant. And because the movie really deals more with Hollywood moviemaking and television in the late sixties, when the focus turns to the victims it is more on Sharon than the others, which is understandable. After all, she was in movies. Brad Pitt garnered the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated for Lead Actor. Both were deserving.Is the soundtrack good? With Quentin, do you really have to ask?I'm not going to say anymore for fear of spoilers, except to say my all-time favorite movie for what has now been almost 30 years is The Shawshank Redemption. But over time and after some more viewings, I'm sure 'Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood' will be pushing really, REALLY hard for that top spot.And one more thing: Thank you, Mr. Tarantino, for honoring Sharon Tate and her friends the way you did.", "Tarantino's own desire what should have happened": "This movie is like Dunkirk is to Christopher Nolan. Having such an illustrious career so far, no one can blame Tarantino to make a movie for himself as a priority, not the audience. Just like in his famous Inglorious Basterds, this movie is as well the director's personal opinion and view, what should have happened, and how that should have happened. In the previous movie, the utopia was to murder the nazi headquarters, here, to murder the Manson clan's infamous perpetrators.\nIt is beautifully showing the the 69's Hollywood, the movie industry in the view of a series actor and got quite an idea how the Manson family were living at Spahn Ranch.\nOverall, it is not like Pulp Fiction, not like Inglorious Basterds, not like Django Unchained, however a mixture of trademarks can be seen in this movie. A calmer, funnier, less violent Tarantino movie, which were not what I or many expected. However the movie is a nice trip into the 69's Hollywood, and the leads are excellent, Pitt amazing, DiCaprio also hilarious and great acting - Oscar nomination maybe? - and Robbie is lovely as Tate. Must watch, just expect a less brutal Tarantino now.", "Don't get anyone who praises this film": "Amazing acting, horrible plot. Slow to the point I couldn't wait for it to end. He could have written out the entire Tate thing and you wouldn't have missed it and it would have saved the film 45 minutes of worthlessness. Absolutely nothing memorable. You will pull out your hair waiting for this one to the assuming you don't fall asleep.", "Incredibly addictive overated": "Went to the cinema with high expectations.\nIf I had watched that at home I would have paused it at least 10 times and maybe finish it in a few weeks or not at all", "Vivid and spectacular!": "You know what you're getting with a Tarantino film. Retro love letters, slickly produced, with vivid colours and sharp needle drops. This is no different, long drawn out scenes, beautifully shot in the Hollywood hills. It all starts happily, pool parties, driving cars in the sunshine, but this is Tarantino, it's not going to remain pleasant. There's a tangible tension and threat of violence, largely due to the thread of Charles Manson's infamous Tate murders running through the story. That's only part of what's on offer here though, the DiCaprio/Pitt double act for a large portion of the film drives the narrative, before finally connecting, in a fictional melting pot. Now there's often an issue when depicting true events with the sort of sheen that Tarantino employs and that's most evident in some of the casting here. Most of the main players are fine, Pitt in particular, but then his role is essentially fictional. DiCaprio is fine too, but doesn't really fit the TV cowboy he's meant to be. Damian Lewis playing bit part Steve McQueen is way off though and there's some inexplicably narrated exposition. It's things like this that spoil Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. Much has been made of the Bruce Lee depiction too, but as pretty awful as Lee is, Pitt again steals the scene. He does that a lot, take him out of this and you've got a much worse off film. This is Pitts thing though, cool Americana, embracing it's ridiculousness. The whole thing is dusty and bathed in sunshine, whether the streets of 1969 LA or the mock western film set that DiCaprio works on as he tries to rekindle his failing acting career and curtail his drinking. This slow brooding atmosphere works well, as seeds are sown for impending violence, which is largely bottled until the final act. I have to say though, when it lands, boy does it. Knowing what we know about the true events on Cielo Dr, this telling is nothing short of spectacular. It's not his best film by a long way, but it is better than recent outings. Not everyone likes Tarantino, but I loved this.", "It's Tarantino's Valentine to 1969": "Quinton Tarantino is perhaps today's director with the greatest love affair with past greats and not-so-greats. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a washed-up actor with Brad Pit playing his long-time stunt double. Their chemistry is apparent and Tarantino throws in enough '60s references to show his love of the era, from clips of shows like Mannix and The FBI to the brief appearance of such song's as Billy Stewart's cover of Gershwin's \"Summertime\" to early Deep Purple (who were much bigger in the US than the UK). But \"Once Upon a Time\" is a fairy tale, with the Manson subplot taking a sharp right turn from reality. Also casting Bruce Dern and having special effects master John Dykstra working together nearly50 years after they did \"Silent Running\" is a great touch. Like all Tarantino, it will divide opinions--as is shown by the ratings and reviews here. I found it thoroughly enjoyable and one of Tarantino's best.", "It's not epic- it's good.": "There is a reason it doesn't rate as high as other Tarantino movies. Great acting. Lovely sceneries. Decent to good dialogue. Cool slash pretty crazy development when you know the background story. So it's a good picture with some good scenes, but the total result comes a bit short in my opinion plainly because the script and the story just isn't great. Worth a watch any day, but don't expect to be as spoiled by Tarantino as you're used to.", "The Equivalent of Having A Crackhead Extricate Your Fingernails With Pliers.": "What version of fresh hell is \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\"? Really, are we supposed to feel sympathy for Hollywood actors because \"they're just like us?\" Gimme a break. This flick is the equivalent of an NFL lineman lamenting, \"I'm hurt! Can't you see that?\" Listen, folks. We put people on pedestals, like the gladiatorial Romans did, for a reason - to entertain us regardless of the cost to their souls. No one forces somebody to be a movie star, or Playboy playmate, or NFL player, or...get the picture? It's purely voluntary; no one cares about your hardships. That's what all that money, drugs, champagne, and mansions are for. You want sympathy? Go see a priest. Trust me; he's not the saint he claims to be either.Update: Okay. Having seen the ending (the last 5 minutes of the film), I have to conclude it's brilliant in the sense that \"Magnolia\" was brilliant, that is, everything you saw for the past two hours was BS - here's the real story.

Actually, the cast played their parts well and it was an interesting storyline, but there were major deficiencies. The script and direction made the movie difficult to follow. It was choppy and didn't move smoothly. It wasn't until we were more than halfway through the movie that I realized the story was based on life events that took place in the 60's (which I was a college student). I don't recommend this movie.", "1969's Tate-LaBianca Murders: An Alternate Ending": "Most films you can distill to a simple \"This film was about...\", not this one. There are so many things it's about. It's mainly a slice of life from the late 60s at the time of the Tate-LaBianca murders (Manson). But it's chiefly about American muscle in the form of Cliff Booth (stuntman) and Rick Dalton (western actor). Cliff (Brad Pitt) shames Bruce Lee in studio lot fight, shames one of Manson's hippie boys, and drives a big 'ole Cadillac El Dorado or something like it. Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) uses a flame thrower from one of his films to torch another Manson hippie during the grand finale home invasion. And in this tinsel-town fantasy tale of the Tate-LaBianca murders, the Manson clan gets their asses kicked, which is of course how we'd all like to think it should've happened once upon a time in Hollywood...", "I like Tarantino, but this film ain't his best...": "I don't know the runtime for this flic, but because of many long & drawn out scenes, it feels forever. Too many times are we watching nothing but people living in their environment, talking with the witty dialogue that you'd expect from a Tarantino film, but not living up to it. It's like a watching a film that's trying its hardest to be a Tarantino film -_-.There are parts that shine, sure. I won't deny this film that, but they are far and few between. And while there is a climax at the end, it feels so vastly different in tone from the other 99% of the movie. They WANT you to remember that scene. Ya know, because it's so over the top.

It' s entertaining, it has DiCaprio, Pitt, even Pacino and many lovelies you'd expect from anything Hollywood and especially about Hollywood. It won't do anything to make you love the biz. Again, so what! What it will do is lead you by the hand on a walk through memory lane and with the very biz geeky (meant positively) view of Tarantino. Can you get a better guide?You've read the IMDb storyline? It's self explanatory and it is a perfect premise to showcase actors acting in the role of actors. What the IMDb storyline doesn't mention, and this is my spoiler part, is the insertion of Charlie Manson, the notorious (have you seen a photo of him lately, scary!) cult killer slash mass murderer and his merry band of sexy looking freaks.

I was excited about this movie, but waited for the digital release because I didn't think I could handle the long run time. I'm glad I waited. Unfortunately, this film suffers the same issues as many of his other films, but worse. Tarantino writes fantastic scenes. That can be said for nearly every one of his films. But putting them together in a film that tells an interesting story is where he drops the ball. This film has many interesting standalone scenes, but once I finally made it through the full move after 3 days, I was left with a sense of \"What did I just watch?\" I'll admit I'm too young to care about the setting of this film. If you aren't a huge film buff or emotionally connected to Hollywood in the 1960's, you probably won't care either. I think the success of this film relies heavily on that and the name Tarantino. Essentially, it's 2 and a half hours of Leonardo crying, Brad Pitt acting cool, Margot Robbie going to the movies, and feet. Lots and lots of feet. Watch at your own risk.", "Once Upon A Time Well Spent !": "Just finished watching this film, I enjoyed it very much, very intriguing story with a lot of hilarious scenes.

The movie spends way too much time on unnecessary things and way too little time on the Manson 'family'. I'd have liked to see more time spent on them, to at least see Tarantino's interpretation of them flushed out a bit more.I DO hope however that Tarantino will release a directors cut edition of the film, and hopefully show like at least 20mins+ more of scenes that didn't make the theatrical cut, which shows more of the stuff that traditional Tarantino movies are renowned for. THAT would be a treat.", "Very boring and really no sense": "The film is really awful, I'm totally dissappointed with QT, it's an abuse of the patient of the audience. The first 2 hours are very boring, there's nothing to spoil because there's nothing! What a pity go to the cinema to watch this film!!!", "Great Tarantino, slow story": "I like the movie. Its Tarrantino. No classic evening entertainment. But: as a fan I can say, the movie itself has some weakness in the story. There is no casual, clear story as usual. Its completely weird and just narrated as it would be realtim. There is no Boom, excapt for the end. But: loveley detailed, great characters and lovely acting.", "Erm!": "I'm not even sure where to begin. Hateful 8 was long and tedious but I think this movie has popped it to the post. Meandering at best. Just skip the first two hours ...", "The Essence of Tarantino": "When you think you've seen the worst of the overrated Quentin Tarantino, something always surprises you. The film (and its inexcusable justifications) manages to reach an even more severe scale in the rotting of arguments, a mixture of prejudices, jingoisms and pseudo history. Bruce Lee's retraction can only be defined as something vile and cruel, the director's much-lauded cinematic bases are nothing but cheap copies of Sam Peckinpah, Kurosawa and Nouvelle Vague itself. Anyway, the 1969 Hollywood in Tarantino's head seems to have come out of the sewer of an extremist propaganda, a monotonous bunch of alpha males in search of who knows what, but which undoubtedly pleases the processed palate of today's Hollywood, increasingly lazy, monotonous, trapped among its clich\u00c3\u00a9s ...", "Kinda overrated": "First of all, I didn't dislike the movie. The cinematography and acting is amazing and I like the characters. What I don't really like is that the movie doesn't really have a plot. It's basically just a movie, that is a love letter to the 60s. I didn't really have a problem with the pacing, but i don't think the movie needed to be 2 hours and 40 min. There are scenes that goes on for to long, to the point that you kinda get bored. Overall an Fine movie that is worth watching once on Netflix or something.", "Very Quentin Tarantino!": "Sorry, please forgive me for not finishing watching the entire movie! I did try my best be seated as long as I could.", "Not bad": "Once upon a time harks back to Cinema of the 50s 60s n 70s. Kinda a nostalgia for those times and the area of film and acting of those decades. Also, it paints the picture of how those seriesnmaely,bounty hunter had such a big influence on the culture and youth. Not Tarantino's best but still watchable and bit of fun action scenes. Brad Pitt is still killin' it!", "Intimate love letter": "By far the best description for this film I have heard is how this is a love letter to Hollywood and film. And I would totally agree with that. However, that letter is extremely intimate and subjective, so I have to look at it in that context as well.Tarantino is one of the few directors who can make films however he wants and in whatever way he imagines it. This film is no exception. It differs from most films released today. He remains faithful to himself and his signature which he uses throughout his filmography. Whatever you think of him, I absolutely appreciate him for it. He pays attention to detail, he is consistent, and although he paid homage to numerous film connections with Hollywood, he again managed to make the film look fresh and original. It is a real gift and talent. It is clear to me that a certain population will not like this film at all. It lasts longer than the expected average, there are a lot of longer shots, there are parts where \"nothing happens\", scenes that are a purpose in themselves, meaningless and trivial dialogues (so is this one of his trademarks or what?!). However, the point is that Tarantino managed to get away with all these \"flaws\" or deviations from the expectations that the average viewer has when he wants to watch a movie.For me personally, this is not Tarantino's best film, I don't know if it's in the top 5 of his films (it also speaks of his career), but I can't help but appreciate when anyone makes a film like this these days, paying attention to every detail and shot. The film visually looks like it was shot in the 1960s in original locations as faithful as it looks. The best part of the film for me is the main duo of Di Caprio and Pitt, as their friendship and connection through the film world is portrayed. The film \"lost\" me a bit somewhere in the middle because I didn't see the point in the plot and some of the scenes, personally, seemed unnecessary to me. At the very end, the crescendo of the film is made in the typical Tarantino style and definitely ends in a satisfying tone. Just like every fairy tale ends, unlike real life.", "perfect": "In some people they say a boring movie, but it is not like that. A very beautiful movie and with the style of Tarantino. I really enjoyed the movie, and I did not feel any boredom as I watched it. The film spoke about the end of the classic actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the field of acting and how he was disappointed in his performance, and on the other hand, Doubler Rick and It is Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) their performance was more than wonderful and the relationship between them was terrible and on the other hand and an exceptional figure is Margot Robbie in the role of Sharon comes her appearance was little. Three parts in the story and the most part I enjoyed in it. The second part was very interesting. The movie scenario is strong and elaborate. On top of all this, the end of the movie was awesome and the twist was beautiful. Also, the secondary characters are very beautiful, and each role was played almost completely.", "A classic Tarantino film...if there ever was one": "Once upon a time in Hollywood, there was a famed director who had a reputation for telling engaging, twisted, thought-provoking stories on the big screen. Quentin Tarantino has proven himself over and over again, through efforts like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Django Unchained' to 'Inglorious Basterds,' Tarantino surely knows how to pull off a great piece of cinema.In 'Hollywood,' Tarantino tells the story of a washed up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) as they navigate the landmines of the 1960s film industry and (unknowingly) become more deeply entangled in a sinister plot. As usual for a Tarantino film, the dialogue really carries the torch for everything else. The Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth quick-fire exchanges serve as the foundation for the entire film, and the constant barrage of witty one-liners do more to build up the story than they do to detract from it.The casting throughout 'Hollywood' is on point, with Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate and Bruce Dern as the cranky old film studio head George Spahn being two standouts. And given this film is about Hollywood, it would only make sense that there are a number of familiar faces from tinseltown, from the late Luke Perry and Damian Lewis to Dakota Fanning and Emile Hirsch. Each of these actors deliver in one way or another.But perhaps one of the most impressive aspects of 'Hollywood' is the way it bobs, weaves and otherwise maneuvers through dramatic sequences without feeling too heavy. Even in some of the most serious scenes, there is always a hint of sarcasm, irony or deadpan to keep things from feeling too jarring. It would be unfair to categorize 'Hollywood' as anything other than a drama, but as expected for a Tarantino film, it's not your typical Hollywood drama.'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood' is going to get all the right attention and accolades in the runup to the Academy Awards nominations. Don't be surprised if it takes home more than a few golden statues.", "disappointed": "If you want to do movie with perfect production you must have a story ! It was like a pilot for a serise no story ! Even sharon story which i was excited about they change it \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00a5", "Tarantino's Feet-iest Movie Yet": "Tarantino's ninth film has been hotly anticipated, and with good reason. Just to be alive at a time where Tarantino makes a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt sharing the leads is fantastic. It's the assembly of the best of Hollywood this side of the millenium. Except I left the cinema not feeling like it lived up to that at all. I'm somewhat disappointed, and without having seen Death Proof (still, I know), this is Tarantino's worst movie.This is where I usually go into the general plot to provide context, but it's precisely this point that left me disappointed. There's no story. Not really. Rick Dalton is a has-been actor coming to the realisation that he's not as treasured in Hollywood as he used to be. Cliff Booth is his stunt double and now personal handyman, essentially blacklisted from Hollywood after allegedly killing his wife. These two fictional characters are thrust into late-60s Hollywood, and intimately related to Sharon Tate and the Manson Family. And that's the story. That's the whole thing. There aren't plot points, just characters going through the motions.Rick and Cliff meander around LA for the first two-thirds of the movie. Rick gives a villainous performance on the set of a Western TV show while grappling with his own insecurities, while Cliff fixes an antenna, daydreams a little, and offers a lift to a member of the Manson Family back to Spahn Ranch. Meanwhile Sharon Tate goes to a small cinema to watch one of her own movies and enjoys the audience's reactions. The actual plot doesn't kick in until a 6-month time jump with the time filled in by narration, essentially cutting out some of the more interesting build-up of the film, and jumping back into the infamous Manson Family Murders, or at least Tarantino's own alternate history, fairytale retelling.Even now I'm struggling to reconcile what the point of the first two-thirds even was. The only part that felt relevant was Cliff's escapades at Spahn Ranch as they tied directly into the film's climax. The rest was just Hollywood being self-congratulatory and intimately establishing Rick's character. Sharon Tate's inclusion was utterly pointless and could've been cut out entirely without creating any holes. I can't say I was ever bored as Tarantino is certainly capable of making the mundane seem interesting, but it certainly dragged and felt overly meandering. It's hard to believe he spent four or five years writing this and such a large portion is badly-paced and pointless. I understand this is a 'memory piece' for him, portraying the Hollywood he grew up with when he was younger, but I didn't grow up with it. I don't hold any kind of nostalgia for this time period. I want to say that's why this movie didn't do it for me, but my dad felt the same, despite it showing his childhood era of TV and movies as well.There are moments during the movie's trunk that are worth watching though. While Rick Dalton's story on the set of a Western TV show is ultimately pointless and goes on for way too long, seeing him struggle with his insecurities offered the film's biggest emotional backbone. His conversation with his young co-star about the book he's reading and how it reminds him of himself, his breakdown in his trailer after a scene gone badly, and his reaction to praise received after a scene gone right are definite highlights of his character, and DiCaprio pulls them off fantastically. Another best actor win? Maybe not, but a really good show of talent nonetheless. I can't imagine much harder than being actor playing an actor playing a role, but he doesn't falter one bit.That said, Cliff Booth is arguably the real main character of the movie. He comes off as a genuinely nice guy with a big heart, and while Rick pays him to be his handyman and driver, there is a real friendship between them nonetheless, completely devoid of male friendship clich\u00c3\u00a9s. Cliff is also a complete and utter badass, besting Bruce Lee in a spar, potentially being a wife-murderer, and taking on an entire cult on their own ground without showing an ounce of fear. Throughout the movie's runtime he's established as the kind of guy you want on your side, because he'll treat you well, and not a guy you want to oppose, because he will take you down. Of course he's instrumental in the film's alternate history climax and shows why this characterisation as a badass was not only downright cool, but also necessary. Out of all the subplots in the first two-thirds, Cliff's are the hardest to cut. And Brad Pitt owns it. He exudes cool and charm, is evidently quite capable in a fight, and hits all the comedic beats perfectly as well (his experience with acid was the source of much laughter).As much as I love Margot Robbie, Sharon Tate's presence was unfortunately useless. Margaret Qualley was also included literally just to be underage (character-wise at least) eye-candy, with a flirty presence, and near-exploitative camera angles of her various body parts. Yes, including feet. Once Upon a Time... is Tarantino's most feet-iest movie to date. There's bare feet everywhere. Robbie gets her bare feet out in the movie theater, Dakota Fanning walks around in bare feet, and Qualley's bare feet literally take up half the screen in her scenes with Brad Pitt. Almost every other famous face is a cameo, from Bruce Dern holed up in bed, Michael Madsen included just to prove Tarantino doesn't always kill his characters off (and his car gets more screentime than he does), Al Pacino as Rick's agent at the beginning, Austin Butler as the despicable Tex, Dakota Fanning as the 'Mama' of the Manson Family, Emile Hirsch as the pointless-Tate's best friend Jay Sebring, Damien Lewis spreading gossip at the playboy mansion as Steve McQueen, Timothy Olyphant as the star of the Western TV show being filmed alongside Scoot McNairy and Clifton Collins Jr., Kurt Russell as a stunt coordinator and Zoe Bell as his wife, as well as Lena Dunham, Maya Hawke, and Harley Quinn Smith as members of the Manson Family (Rumer Willis, another daughter of the famous, is also in there as Joanna Pettet).As a Tarantino fan, I'm unfortunately siding with the opinion that you could probably get away with missing this entirely. There's some good stuff in here, but too much of it is there just for its own sake. The film feels unfocussed and overlong, like it could do with a few more drafts in editing. The only scenes really worth watching are those involving Cliff and then everything after the 6-month jump. I give Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood an enjoyable but underwhelming 7/10. Maybe I'll reconsider with a rewatch, but that's where I sit initially.", "A Love it Or Hate It Movie...": ".... they say. Yet, I find I am somewhere in the middle. I did like it mostly however.It is first and foremost a film that speaks to nostalgia, a nostalgia of someone who actually was not there and romanticizes, in this case, Hollywood.Secondly, it is a buddy movie. An actor who is falling down the rankings and his trusty and loyal companion fall guy are played by Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt respectively and they carry the film. The two actors bring their A-game to the film and are forces of nature on the screen. Add an intelligent dog who could make the A-list himself.Like most current films Once Upon A Time in... Hollywood takes its time and could have used some time editing, but I have to say that I have no regrets watching it.", "So good": "Deserves the hype - awesome movie with heaps of pop culture references. I'd been really looking forward to seeing this and wasn't disappointed.", "Tarantino let us down": "I was so excited about a new Tarantino film hitting the screens. Nine of ten. Magnum Opas. Multi-threaded e.g. \"Pulp Fiction.\" Was going to be better than \"Django\" and \"Hateful Eight\".Cinematography was great. Cast played their roles perfectly. He even interjected a bit of humor to keep it rolling. But it never got rolling. He forgot to interject a plot, a story, a reason to watch the film. Yes, we must unsheathe the word that cannot be spoken when speaking of the king of cool cinema - boring.I guess he gets one more shot to define his legacy.", "An Instant Bomb": "I was expecting the usual sharp Tarentino dialogue, swagger and action but was extremely disappointed. The cinema that I was in had people walking out but I stayed until the end. I should have walked out as there's no pay off in the end.Big name stars and DiCaprio definitely doesn't shine in this one. The entire movie should have been about Brad Pitt's character. Alot more interesting and Pitt nails this one as usual.My advice, give this one a miss. His hit movie making days are over.", "Pointless Drivel. Beware FOMO.": "The simple truth of the matter is that Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Reservoir Dogs remain the pinnacle of Tarantino's film making career. and some of those films deservedly are notable highlights of the art form itself. Since then it has all been self-indulgent failure for whatever the reasons. Personally, I couldn't care less to pontificate as to why that is the case.Once...a Time... is based in cheap celebrity worship, relying on the reputations of its two megastars to convince audiences they are watching gold dust. There is no plot, no noticeable dialogue, and no point to the film. The music tricks audiences in the final third into suspense, but overall I found the experience forgettable, except for the amazing hysteria surrounding the film via the mainstream media.I Don't think I will bother to watch another film by QT, seeing as how his later career oeuvre has petered out. This film, while certainly not his worst, is very very far from the breathtaking cinema and promise of his early output.If you can stomach the fomo, save your money.", "Another Unique Film From Tarantino. Great Location Shooting In Old Hollywood.": "I'm glad someone wandered around with a decent camera and got some good footage of the real Hollywood, while some of it still exists.

It has two!On one side we have sharon and roman polanski, who don't need no introduction as we all know what happened that night.Next to them lives a fictional character, Rick Dalton, who is struggling to survive in the film industry as he is becoming a \"has been\".So i don't understand why people keep saying that it has no plot or that nothing happens, i suggest they watch the whole movie instead and enjoy good cinema", "missing a story": "If you have nothing else to watch, go ahed and watch it, but there is no story to follow in the movie. The acting is good, editing and shooting is good, but the complete lack of story is why i rate this movie low.", "A+ Characters and Story Telling": "Not sure why this is getting a mixed bag of reviews.

Maybe I'll remember this movie for ever because of how much it tested my patience not to leave the room.\nThere might be a true meaning and real facts behind the story, but it is really a waste of time. No nothing there. If cinema is to entertain you, don't go.\nDidn't rate 1 because some scenes were very well done.\nA movie like this with not so many famous actors would never have success as this one apparently had.", "Tarantinos Best since death proof.": "Tarantino once again makes a payback movie with his pulp twist. Where the true scum of the earths gets the bad outcome. It feels liberating to watch the bad guys get kicked around like looser trash towards the end. One can only guess how many times Polanski must have wished this was the outcome. Stepping inside the house of a stuntman that kicked Bruce lee around and a drunken cowboy with a flamethrower. Its definitely Tarantinos coolest work since Death Proof and I really dig way of doing movies. He just makes oldschool movies without a care about the controversy and streaming checklists of today. Its a breeze to watch a movie where everything goes and anything sure does.", "Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood Review I 89/100": "One of the best films from Quentin Tarantino. Good work from DiCaprio and Pitt. The end is amazing. The last 15 Minutes of the film changes everything. Without knowing the story of Sharon Tate the film is worse but still pretty good but if you know Sharon Tate's story it's amazing. 89/100", "Great Story Telling": "Take a bit of fact, add some creative licence, with a great cast and shoot it beautifully, overall a good movie which is a story on the screen.As the story unfolds Brad Pitt steals most scenes but has stiff competition from Di Caprio and Margot Robbie simply looks stunning, it's what movies should be, bold and in your face culture, really enjoyable.", "Love QT, but...": "This movie has no point whatsoever. I still don't understand what the movie was about (other than watching Brad and Leo be Brad and Leo). Although the acting was good, the movie itself was slow paced, confusing, and, well, boring. My wife and I were really excited about this one. Instead, we ended up walking out 3/4 through the movie. Save your money; wait until it comes out on dvd.", "Well the last one hour worked for me": "I had high hopes from the film and I can say my hopes didn't crashed. Quentin Tarantino gave his usual classic filmmaking in the last one hour. Frankly speaking for the first hour, I wasn't that impressed. While both the actor did great jobs in their roles. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad pitt give their all in this film but Al Pacino was simply wasted.The superb climax made this movie a good overall.", "Leo is GOAT\ud83d\udc10": "In the movie, leo was acting the scene of acting in another movie. He also had to act the scene of forgetting the lines from this movie. How complicated that sounds.", "One of those weird drama movies": "I did actually find the movie interesting and I liked the characters, but I don't quite understand what the plot was about. It just basically told the story of the days in the lives of some actors and apparently certain parts of the movie are actually true, which I didn't know when watching the movie. There's not much action in the movie until the last 30 minutes, which was quite interesting I have to say, and I didn't know why that scene was happening until I read the plot after watching the movie.", "Mediocre at best.": "Tarantino goes out with a whimper in this slow pointless movie.", "Bruce Lee Deserves Better": "Brad Pitt's fantasy take down of Lee manages to combine the signature Tarantino white savior motif (he's defending Cassius Clay!) with an emasculating stereotype of Lee. Lee's function as a character seems to be to showcase Pitt's longing for a bygone era of easy white male violent domination. But there is no hint of a critical lens here. The movie is on Pitt's side! The audience laughed, and is supposed to laugh, at Lee and with Pitt when Pitt mocks Lee's sounds. Because we're supposed to think he sounds so foreign and funny? This scene is not a critique of white mediocre male domination fantasies. It's a celebration. Thankfully the scene is interrupted by another stereotype-the nagging wife. Cool!While there are plenty of reasons that this movie is a boring solipsistic slog, I guess I would just highlight the Lee thing bc no one seems to be talking about it. Wtf.", "Cult movie on Mansion Family Murders": "Movie about television actor (his carrier is about to end) and his stunt double who has been by his side for so long. How he encourages him to be better and supports him everyway possible. The potrayal of being a good friend in real sense and how the hollywood was in 60s.\nThis movie is based on the the murders by Charles Mansion. This movie in itself reveals the Quentin Tarantino special effect of mess at the end.", "Great concept, dry dialogue": "I was dying to love this movie. Brad Pitt was great, Leo's character was totally unlikable. The dialogue lacked the Tarantino wit, pace, and zip. Al Pacino was completely wasted. Last 10 minutes were great, but it was a real slog to get there", "Great but not his best": "To describe any Tarantino film as less than excellent would be, in my opinion, sacrilege. So let's cut to the chase here. This is excellent.The question is...how excellent? And how 'acceptable'.And that's where deconstructing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood becomes tricky.It's most similar in its narrative structure, I'd say, to Pulp Fiction, probably his flawed masterpiece, in that it doesn't really have one. I mean there's kind of a story, a long one, but I don't think that's what he set out to do here.He set out to capture the fragility of two fading performers; one a star actor (DiCaprio) and one a star stunt man (Brad Pitt).That the movie's triumph lies in the hands of Pitt rather than DiCaprio is interesting. Probably DiCaprio has more screen time, but Pitt has more presence. And Pitt is coping better with his fall from grace.It's almost a portmanteau (I know my friends say I'm a pretentious for using that word) but it is a THING. Usually a portmanteau is a loosely linked collection of short films under a kind of director's curation.Here, though, I think it is a sort of continuous dream sequence, of beautiful but uneventful linking scenes, between big 'pieces' - the portmanteaus - it's like walking through an art gallery enjoying a painter's studies before BOOM, here's the big canvas.Tarantino creates 8 or 9 stunning canvases. One of the most affecting, for me, being the beautiful and funny scene DiCaprio shares with 8 year old Julia Butters as his method acting co star in a last chance Hollywood western.To say the one scene of violence is a career high would be to both underestimate it and potentially spoil the movie so I won't disclose where, when or how it happens, like the best of Tarantino it is unexpected and both viscerally shocking and hilarious.One of my female companions only had eyes for the stunningly handsome Brad Pitt (there's quite a diet Coke moment about an hour in - and I have ordered the Champion Spark Plugs T Shirt) and I thought he stole the show (see above), but let's not gloss over DiCaprio. He's great. But the devil has the best tunes.Margot Robbie is no more than a muse, and wasted. He does that a lot - does Quentin - a weakness. Uma Thurman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Pam Grier have bucked the trend, but it's rare to leave a Tarantino screening with the actresses front of mind.Is he a masoginist? No, I don't think so, but close, but it's the guys that get the greater spoils in the master's work.The other question the film undoubtedly raises though is...is he racist? Uncomfortable, yes, but I felt pretty creeped out by the Bruce Lee scene where Karate and eastern fighting arts are pretty much laughed off the screen in the Bruce Lee fight scene. I didn't find it acceptable actually.The music has been hailed as a masterpiece, but for me it's one of his weaker selections. Trying to cram too much in.The styling, though, is exquisite, as is the cinematography.Overall I'd rank it as in the upper half, just, of his repertoire. But what do you think?I'd go.Kill Bill Part 1\nPulp Fiction\nJackie Brown\nThe Hateful Eight\nOnce Upon a time in Hollywood\nDjango Django\nDeath Proof\nReservoir Dogs\nInglorious Basterds\nKill Bill Part 2", "Low art and cheap thrills": "Considering the budget and talent available, a disapointment.", "Are you OK? Is everyone OK? Boring disappointment with a shocking ending!": "This year so far I believed the two main contenders for Best Picture during the Oscars would be 'Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood' and 'Ford v Ferrari'. Well, I was wrong and even think that 'Avengers: Endgame' has bigger chance of winning the award than this Hollywood drama/'comedy'. I mean, there was no comedy in it, the first two hours didn't have any content at all...I watched 'Pulp Fiction' two days ago and my expectations for this one were really high, because Quentin Tarantino usually delivers top movies. I was really hoping to see a masterpiece, but I left the theatre with frustration and anger for the wasted time. I saw Leonardo DiCaprio's character whining for 2 hours, Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate didn't have any contribution to the plot, her main scenes were part of the brilliant trailer that made me watch this movie. I feel they were both wasted in this one - Margot Robbie is an incredible actress and might be the best in Hollywood right now, while Leo DiCaprio is a top performer for more than 20 years. I didn't enjoy their characters as much as I enjoyed Vince Vega or Butch Coolidge.The character that I found quite interesting was actually Cliff Booth and Brad Pitt might be the only person in this movie with an Oscar worthy performance. His acting was extremely good in this one and I think his three main scenes were fascinating: the one against Bruce Lee, the one in Spanh Ranch and the ending one which I would also describe as shocking.To sum up, 'Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood' is not a masterpiece, but its musical score and some single acting performances saved its rating. When you hear 'Are you OK?'/ 'Is everyone OK? more than 3 times at the end of the movie, then you will be frustrated and it's not funny...", "First time I walkout of the cinema... then got to watch the \"great\" end at home...": "The worst movie ever... you don't make such pointless movies.... unless you are QT obviously.... No spoilers as nothing happens, you can skip 2 hours and be back for the last 40 mins... some good laugh at the very last 15 mins and bam the end! Don't waste money on cinema or whatever, torrent it!", "Slow start, decent body and incredible ending": "The first part was all about setting the scene. Lots of history and cinematography. If you're into effects and not a storyline, take notice of the first hour. The middle has a bit of drama with some good scenes. Still, not that memorable apart from the awesome Bruce Lee scene. Finally, the last hour when the film introduces the Manson family is where the action kicks in. It's gripping and because the villians were based on true characters, makes it more believable. Overall, I think it lacks a bit of storyline but the effects and acting was top notch. A little boring at times but I think it makes up for it because of the amazing cast.", "Very good, not for everyone tho": "I had a blast with this movie Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt's performances where some of the best of 2019. I laughed many times at Brad Pitt he deserved an Oscar. The concept about an actor in Hollywood trying to go from TV to Motion pictures was interesting, but very well executed. The only reason I give it a 9 (9,5) was because of the last scene, where the whole movie turns upside down. It becomes incredibly violent and a little bit disturbing but I did somehow like that scene a bit tho I was shocked. Awsome movie, I highly recommend it", "Too much fluff not enough plot": "A long and uneventful film full of A list actors trying to out perform each other in scenes that are about as interesting as watching paint dry. The little narrative that it had was complicated by every other scene being on a movie set.", "What a boring and pointless flick": "Oh dear! Tarantino, you're prime ist definatley over. One star is for the acting, the other for the Bruce Lee-scene. Everything else are just randomly aligned scenes with no build up and storyline. Almost during the whole movie you find youself just waiting for the one scene you know is coming right after Shannon Tate appears - and you're waiting endlessy long just to see a It seems like Tarantino knew is film is boring but needed something to keep the viewer at it.", "So boring that I walked out": "I actually walked out 90 minutes into the movie because it was utterly boring... first time I walk out of a movie.But now reading reviews maybe I should have stayed ... but really I don't understand why so freaking slow... I'll just wait for it till it's on TV to finish the last half an hour... and see what the fuss is all about\nI'm sure it's all blown out of proportion and it's not really that great.", "Snooze fest": "Ugh. Talented actors wasted on a terrible script. Expect to see a lot of driving, talking about nonsense and completely useless scenes.", "Shazam!": "I actually liked it! Very entertained by both Main actors", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's fun, haunting homage to the summer of '69": "Quentin Tarantino's ninth feature film features a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. It is set in 1969 and is a fun, haunting homage to the Hollywood of the time. Invented characters rub shoulders with people who really lived (and live), non existent movies and genuine TV shows co-exist, and real life history swerves off into an entirely fantastical alternative universe. The movie caused controversy by portraying Bruce Lee (played by Mike Moh) in a negative light. Other cast members include Damian Lewis playing Steve McQueen, Rafal Zowierucha as Roman Polanski, and Damon Herriman appears briefly as Charles Manson, a role he reprises from the second season of David Fischer's Netflix series Mindhunter. Look out too for Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Luke Perry, and Bruce Dern. It was the first Tarantino film not to involve Bob and Harvey Weinstein following the sexual abuse allegations against the latter, and was a worldwide hit grossing $374 million at the Box Office, with critics praising its screenplay,direction, acting, cinematography, costume design, production values and soundtrack. Too bad it's overlong running time and lack of proper narrative make it feel like an over indulgent exercise in self-gratification at times.", "AVERAGE": "GreetingsConsidering about 100M $ of budget and actors like Leonardo, Pitt, Margot, Al and departed Perry, this film is below expectations. Not a gem of Tarantino, the movie lacks plot, tension and orientation. At times entertaining, it mostly presents the life of Hollywood actor Rick Dalton and his stuntman, back in the retro 60s. My rating is 6 for average.Sincerely,Julio Protopapas", "A fine ride.": "An engaging journey packed with 60's Hollywood, music and TV culture pathos, presented via the hypercritical perspective of those that were there in the middle of it at the time. Brilliantly created film in all departments, from the fine details to the overall pacing, this is team film-making at its unified best.Apart from a few moments of very nasty violence, this is a masterpiece.\nWell done Tarantino and team. The direction, casting, acting, production design, costumes, grade, musical aspects, sound design, script and more - are all outstanding.Thanks for the experience !", "No plot, drags on and on": "Wow, what a waste of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The only reason I watched the entire thing, was because I was trapped on a plane for 3 hours. At one point, I asked the flight attendant if she has a parachute because the film was so bad.Now, don't get me wrong, the fact that it's set in the late 60s is cool. You get to see some nice cars, everyone wearing old clothes, and fancy 60s hairstyles, and it's got a nostalgic feel ... but there is NO story in the entire film. At first you think it's going to be a buddy buddy comedy, but nothing happens to advance or slow down the friendship. You think it might be about one of the characters career, but his career never really advances or slow either. You get a mish-mash of back-stories from their lives, that have ZERO bearing on what is going on in the present.Once again, there are some interesting scenes, but nothing that adds to the main storyline (because it doesn't exist). There are some cool cameos, but once again, they add nothing to the whole story. I can tell you that \"an actor and his stuntman are good friends\", then tell you to fast forward with 25 minutes left in the movie, and you will have all the information you need to understand what is going on (because NOTHING HAPPENS FOR THE FIRST 2 hours and 15 minutes).Horrible film. Waste of time. Hollywood needs to stop supporting crap like this just because a few big names are in it.", "Once upon a dime I spent on Hollywood.": "Great idea, boring movie. The final 15 minutes were pretty good. Overdeveloped story line simply to get to the point.", "Oh Boy... Where Do I Start?": "Someone said, the more you appreciate cinema as an art, the more you will like this film. I do appreciate cinema as an art, hence why I disliked this film.Another too-long voyage from the mind of Quentin Tarantino, who blew his remaining talent on Pulp Fiction, yet continues to clog cinemas with his meandering rambling stories that offer very little payoff.Here I thought he may cleverly weave a story around the Manson murders but was disappointed to see he had the arrogance to attempt to rewrite history. Sure, it would have been great had there been heroes to save Sharon Tate and her friends, but it didn't happen. So why write a two-hour and forty-one minute snorefest to say it did happen.It was difficult to like either main character in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayl of slowly declining actor Rick Dalton was filled with as much overacting, if not more, than he unloaded in Wolf of Wall Street. Brad Pitt's role of loyal Cliff Booth, Dalton's stunt double was about as emotionless as a corpse.The movie lacked plot points which doesn't give the viewer any indication where the movie is going. Useless scenes that do not advance plot or evolve characters. And Taratino's need to let the world know he has a foot fetish by adding, three (I counted but could have missed others) references to women's feet in your face.In the end, the main characters were just as flawed as when the movie started hours prior. History was changed instead of supporting an actual creative story.Tarantino gets marks for directing and sending us on a well-painted, yet useless, journey in 1969.The only thing that Tarantino did for me is let his history for mundane lengthy epics keep me out of the theatre and save me money by watching it on Demand.", "A Different Look": "Once you've seen the film you'll appreciate the title more but spoilers excluded it was nice to see a different take on expected outcomes. Film did an excellent job of separate character vignettes and stories to reinforce emotional histories of characters to spin strong threads for weaving a strong and well blended plot line. Adding some vintage characters like Dern, Pacino, Palansky and Russell amplified the classic quality. The film in a film theme took that to an even higher level. Acting by Pitt and DeCaprio splendid and Robbie showed exquisite anti Harley skills at making subtle impressions a major factor. Her in-theater role and scene was sweet. Even if you don't Tarantino you should see this one. Bravo!", "Entertaining but utterly pointless": "In many ways Once Upon a Time.... is brilliant. It is visually stunning, with some great performances, especially from Brad Pitt who is outstanding throughout, and we are treated to some marvellous customary Tarantino-gore. However it lets itself down with a plot that is more like watching half an hour of five different films and without any real understanding of why half the scenes are in the final edit. For example why have several famous 'characters' who pop up then disappear without any sense of impacting the film other than to show that Tarantino knew who the movers and shakers of the day were? Although perhaps that is the whole point and maybe the intention is to flesh out the bizarre world of those in the Hollywood-arena who seem to be as equally disjointed as this movie. Just a shame that there wasn't a bit more plot development put into Once Upon a Time..... as it has the potential to be an absolute classic. A coherent story to go along with the stylish film-making could have made this movie great. There are lots of car journeys in the film that we follow but then realise they aren't really going anywhere, which is a bit like the flow of the whole film. If you like that sort of thing and enjoy unparalled amounts of shots of people's legs, endless cigarette smoking and random narration inserts, you'll love this. If you're looking for something more, you might not. One wonders if anyone but Tarantino had pitched this movie 'idea' would the studios have even considered making it?", "Better the second time": "I rewatched it, because I saw Mindhunter and really wanted to see the connection with the Manson crimes. I enjoyed it more. Didn't consider it the same, as boring as the first time, but still, not that great in order to improve the grade. Nevertheless, great performances from Leo and Brad, worthy nominations, as for the other, not so worthy,besides the costume design win. I think it would have been better if the story was more accurate, the crime department is Quentin's speciality and everybody wanted more of his violence, in my opinion.", "Simply not understandable": "This movie is just a time waste. Not sure what it is about only that I fall into sleep several times as the the story is not catching at all.", "Long shaggy dog story.": "Drags on way too long with filming of western movies, and driving around LA with music blaring. Interesting for those of us who can say \"I was there\" or \"I saw that.\" Loved the ending, but It didn't need over 2 hours of setup to get there.", "Doesn't seem like a Tarantino": "Let me start by telling that i am Big fan of Tarantino's genre. This film which i have no doubt in declaring as just a \"Tribute\" to the Golden age of Hollywood is a \"Flat\" movie with no ripples!! Ripples which you got in Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Death Proof. This movie has a good soundtrack but with a boring screenplay(i can't believe i am saying that for a Tarantino movie!)\nTalking about the characters-\nBrad Pitt's character is so predictible that it's not worth it. Leo's on the other hand is awesome in all sense, i don't know what's the point in keeping Margot Robbie in the film.\nThis film is too long keeping in view that it has got no plot at all. I definitely liked the ending which is a trademark of Tarantino films...the scale on which the movie was made and advertised i expected(prayed) it to be an authentic Tarantino film but as they say \"Truth is stranger than fiction\" i was dissappointed badly....let's hope Quentine comes with a stunner next time.", "Weird as expected but not as good": "Quantin Tarantino's movies are always weird but some of them are quite fun. But this one is all up boring. Not sure what the director is trying to say in the movie instead of making as weird as possible. The only good part is the ending that is over the top yet violently explosive. Typical Quantin Tarantino's style that ends everything in a messy and bloody way. It is a personal stylish movie but not more than that.", "Slow.....slow and slower": "I've read alot of very long winded reviews which go on about cinematography and the essence of the film industry blah blah. If you are looking for classic Tarantino in my opinion it falls short. I got so bored I had to have two goes to get to the end. Even the sound track didn't redeem a disappointing view of what I was hoping was going to be a classic. Sadly in my opinion not but please make your own minds up.", "This is certainly fun but it is no Tarantino masterpiece": "What a stellar cast. From the heavyweights of DiCaprio and Pitt to small gems sprinkled throughout like Tarantino veteran Uma Thurman's daughter in a super-tiny role, this movie takes you on an adventure if you just sit back and relax and let it. A lot of scenes are entertaining on their own, mostly carried by the intensity DiCaprio injects in every word of his dialogue. It is fun to see DiCaprio doing dark comedy which is a rarity for him if you look back at his impressive body of work. However, many scenes in this movie just function in isolation; they don't quite seamlessly interweave with the other scenes, unlike the way \"Pulp Fiction\" brilliantly accomplished this feat. At any rate, this movie is a fun ride, albeit a long ride, with real events and real people interjected but liberties are creatively taken to form alternate realities. Like sure, Pitt's stuntman could beat up Bruce Lee. Right!", "Love Tarantino movies..... hated this.": "This was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time.", "Disappointing...": "With all of these great reviews, Oscars, and it being a Quentin Tarantino film, I held Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood to an extremely high expectation. Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is such a strange movie to me: it has Tarantino's directing style, but it doesn't feel like one of his movies. I really wanted to love this movie because I'm a huge Tarantino fan, but this movie felt useless and overrated. And I can understand why people would love this movie, it's funny and it has a great ending, but this one wasn't exactly for me.The plot butchered this movie in my opinion. During the runtime, you could feel Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood building up for something because of the pacing. The issue is that it was building up to something that wasn't defined at the beginning, so it felt like it was going nowhere. There were many scenes that were specifically for a character's development, so I thought all of them were going to me up and have some insane ending, like what a Tarantino film should have. The ending was quite unique in fact, as it was about Charles Manson's goons attacking Rick Dalton and his stunt double. I really liked this ending, as it took a different approach that was funny and satisfying in a Tarantino way. But I don't think the ending was worthy of a 2h 41min runtime.The most redeeming aspect of the film was the acting. When you have Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, you'd expect to see some great performances. The sad part is that the characters aren't interesting enough to live up to the performances. One issue I have with the movie when it comes to the characters is how poorly they were used. Why have Margot Robbie play a character when the character barely even contributes to the final plot. This begs the question, why have the Polanski and Tate relationship if they were only slightly used at the ending.I do like how stylistic Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is: Tarantino is great at making is film unique. It has that 60s vibe that is awesome when done right. Great song selection plays an important part in a 60s movie: it has to be upbeat and fun to set the mood. Tarantino also did a great job with making Rick Dalton's movies seem like a classic westerner.Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is the greatest disappointment of Quentin Tarantino's directing career. This movie isn't bad though, it did a lot of things right, and I really wanted to like this movie, but there were too many issues. It had a weak plot that felt like it was going nowhere throughout the entire runtime. It misused almost half of the characters, and they weren't all that interesting. Honestly, I can see why a lot of people would like this movie, but it's too overrated for me.", "Reinventing Hollywood": "\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" should be the correct approach to any movie, and that is probably what I did here upon entering Once upon a time in Hollywood. I went to judge it as a Tarantino movie with an impressive cast, and left the cinema with the impression of having hated 2h of the movie and liking only the last part. And then I spent 2 days pondering over the story and started to really like it and finding it the best Tarantino. WTF would you say, well let's look at why the movie wouldn't work but... actually it does.Oh my gosh, this movie is long, 2h40 and not a lot going on, you are taken across scenes after scenes of \"tarantinesque\" storytelling of how Hollywood was/is working with its intricacies with actors, stuntmen and producers backstabbing each others and downplaying each others. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) driving, DiCaprio DiCapriing etc. etc. And it feels like the story doesn't really evolve much up until the ending which gives you the real feel of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction et al.\nThe actors are amazing throughout the scenes though, and that is what is so surprising on the first look, one is like \"why are they acting so good with such an aimless scenario?\". Shots are beautiful, cinematography is spot on and everything it perfectly in place. And yet you still have the bitter note of having a story diluted over 2h before \"subverting your expectations\" (that is the current fashion term for \"plot twist\") where the Manson family doesn't kill anybody and ends up being dead, in a cathartic way.Uh but wait is it really like that ?Actually I do believe after some thinking that the movie is great for being in its present cut. The rythm is there to install the feel of a slow movie before increasing the pace step by step, and for that it is brilliant, you get the feel of the time, you get to feel the frustration of a changing Hollywood with Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) being of the old school times faced with the new names that are emerging (Polansky, McQueen etc.) and new techniques like the little girl doing her Actor's Studio perfectly, being in the character's body all allong. And you see Rick Dalton changing through that prism, embracing a new way of shooting movies and evolving into the new style of acting. And for that the story is spot on, it is pure Tarantino giving an hommage to an actor that adapts itself for a new time that he can't comprehend before reaching the end. You get the reverie of the old Hollywood merging to the new one.\nYou get the slight touches of modern tackles to current Hollywood too (honorable Cliff Booth refusing to have something going on with the young hippie? Me too movement and recent scandals in Hollywood anyone ?), you bridge the past and present at a time when the studios are starting to get ever powerful once again (Disney and their various ventures as an example) by celebrating a time when the new Hollywood was emerging.\nBut in the end, above all, the main account of the story is rewriting a trauma. Yes that is the end, the murder of Sharon Tate and her friends was a traumatic experience for Hollywood. Here, just like in Inglorious Basterds or Django, Tarantino pays back to history and just deals with a traumatic past in a comical and satisfying way, the bad guys are dead and everybody is happy,no innocent is dead, Hollywood is saved and we can continue to make great movies and enjoy life.And this is why in the end, Once Upon a time in Hollywood should be judged by its cover ! Yes, it's a tale \"once upon a time in Hollywood's kingdom\". Like Anastasia's cartoon, that was slaughtered in real life, but lives to tell the tale in Disney's adaptation. And here we have a tale of Hollywood, of an imaginary and yet impossible moment in history. It's a tale, Rick Dalton, our King Arthur trying to reclaim his title of actor, helped with his Lancelot of Cliff Booth and Brandy the good dog. They save the princess, they fight evil people (Rex/ Tex the 'devil') with their flamethrower (Excalibur) and acid cigarettes and have a happy ending \"...and they lived happily ever after\". Rick Dalton enters the new Hollywood, Cliff Booth saves the day like an amazing knight and Sharon Tate lives. This is a tale, this was the amazing Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.", "I don't get it...": "The movie has no plot, is so slow...just kept waiting for it all to come together. Brad Pitt gets all 4 of my stars for being mildly entertaining and the only reason I did not turn this off half way through. After all the award nominations, just wondering if I missed something...I guess I just don't get it.", "Boringly disappointing.": "Let first make it clear that I'm a Tarantino fan and have been for years. I've never taken his films too seriously but found them to be very entertaining. But although I've been looking forward to seeing this film I found it pretentious and boring. I waited 2 hours 45 mins for something to happen.\nGiven the standard of the cast, really expected more.\nThere were one or two good parts, like when Brad Pitt visited the Manson ranch but generally it was just boring chat.\nI really can't see how people are saying it's the best film they have ever seen?", "While most of the other big budget films today...": "...today are either franchises, spin offs, re-boots or saga wannabes, Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon...is a nostalgic fairytale about his favourite subject (cinema) set in its ideal kingdom (Hollywood). I'll leave it to you to guess who Prince Charming, Snow White, the huntsman and the wicked witches are here.As usual with QT the movie is packed with film and 60's tv references that only a lucky few film buffs will be able to appreciate in its entirety.As usual with Tarantino the writing is clever and the plotting crafty even if his trademark suspence dialogues are almost absent, after all the two protagonists aren't champions of verbose eloquence:\n-The Di Caprio carachter is a self pitying moan with a hint of a stutter who can't help talking about himself even when telling the story of a book he is reading.\n-Pitt's character is a laconic, laid back and out of luck stuntsman whit a caring nature who always speaks out his mind even when facing Bruce Lee or the Manson's lot. Di Caprio and Pitt are pitch perfect in their roles.Margot Robbie brings candour and glee with her homage to Sharon Tate and her role is mirrored by Margaret Qualley's happy-go-lucky hippie girl. The two girls live in the same world but in a social scale they may well be on different planets.\n1969 Los Angeles and it's streets and neon lights is the other protagonist, Tarantino wisely avoids 60's cliches and the town appears both real and nostalgic through Bob Richardson's lighting.Cannot say much more or as I don't want to give away too much, I'll just say that I'm more than eager to a second viewing.", "Mature Tarantino": "\"Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\" is a film that basically tells no story, but that beautifully conveys the atmosphere of Los Angeles during the final days of the Golden Age of Hollywood and the zenith of hippie culture. It's also a sharp meta-commentary of stardom and cinema, as well as an obvious homage to the director's favorite film genres. The lack of plot is balanced by Tarantino's masterful direction, the excellent screenplay, and the flawless acting performances.Rick Dalton and his stunt Cliff Booth are the embodiment of the \"old\" Hollywood, while rising star Sharon Tate represents a new way of life and filmmaking. The two worlds run parallel for the whole film only to cross in the end with the historical revision of the Tate murders. Cliff is introduced as basically Rick's minion and initially seems to only have a marginal role, but the relationship between the two becomes the main driving force of the film. I liked how their opposite lifestyles and personalities managed to complete each other.While Sharon's character works well as a double to Rick's, her scenes ultimately felt like unnecessary screen time. She was supposed to be at the center of the events, but unfortunately, we barely get to see her involved. Her contribution to the plot is so minimal that if you don't know about the Tate murders you would feel disoriented. This is the only real problem of the movie: it acquires most of its value only if you are familiar with the source material.Overall, this film has a lot of brilliant dialogues and iconic scenes that are classic Tarantino, but it also has a more mature tone and relaxed pace that might displease long-time fans. It's perfectly crafted but more focus on the plot wouldn't hurt.", "Not everyone will get": "This is follows a story, much like a Disney film of a fairytale that is Hollywood in the 1960's and follows the lives of 2 actors trying to find and keep their happily ever after. When viewing in the cinema many around me decided to walk out clearly not happy with the lack of violence within the first hour, however this isn't meant to be a gory blood thirsty film, but again rather a story which balances both historical accuracy of those within the 60's of Shannon Tate, ABC's NCIS and Spahn's movie ranch as well as creating Hollywood stars Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth. If people are expecting death and violence throughout you will be mistaken. It's told as a story and that's how it should be viewed as a tale of 20th century easy riders of Hollywood", "Rick Dalton - Stunt?": "Is it a stunt that Leo DiCaprio let Brad be his stunt or is the movie a stunt at all? Probably, Hollywood's worst choice, brad. It's pretty embarrassing to be a TV cowboy and still want fame - it's not that famous, nor relevant, if you consider American fact, drink up. I think it's also un-american to try to play a role so solely different from your look, stick to being blonde Brad, I think it's too high a reach. Overall, Brad's story is always looking to be something he's not, talented.", "good acting performances, washed up tarantino": "Solid performances by the actors esp Pitt, but wow what a wonky script by the hollywood foot licker in chief Tarancreepo. Homie needs to retire, he hasn't been legit since the 90s.Pros : Brad Pitt.", "2 redeeming factors in what is otherwise a car crash of a movie": "The two stars i'm awarding to this film are for the only two positives about it. The acting was good, especially given how two dimensional the characters they were tasked to play were. Character development went out the window for this one.\nAdditionally, the cinematography. Theres no denying the beauty of the movie. In fact this aspect in itself is worthy two stars alone if the rest of the movie wasn't so god damn awful.The storyline was no-existent, the characters were boring with no development throughout the film despite having 3 hours to do so. If this came from anyone other than quentin tarantino it would be considered a car mess.Cats was a better movie than this", "When Hollywood was ......": ".....still the Hollywood that it was. Enjoyable to watch especially if you lived that era. Superb performance by Brad Pitt. Tarantino's best film to date.", "Cliff Booth": "Well,It was different i tell you that. It was still the Tarantino you are used to but there was also another side. And some of you are gonna like it and some of you are not. But oh man is he a master of cinema. It is truly masterfully shot and the actors are great. I always loved Brad Pitt but here he shines as Cliff Booth especially when the film is wrapping up.I understand the people who says that there is no story but there are clearly three stories from three different views. Cliffs, Ricks and Sharons ( Though hers is kinda smaller).It was very enjoyable and I had a blast. I thought the movie went very fast and I must tell you that some scenes are PURE GOLD. Only a master makes scenes like these.I can't for my life understand people who walks out of the cinema in the middle of the movie. This movie is certainly not as bad as some reviews says it is.Cheers Tarantino. Another classic.", "2 hours wasted of my day": "First, let me say that I have been a big fan of Quentin Tarantino.\nSecond. I was very disappointed in this movie.\nSurely, he had the A-list stars to rocket this movie to the top, but he fell terribly short in my opinion.\nNone of the story lines seemed to link effectively, if at all.\nEnjoy a good plot? Forget it. Not in this one.\nAfter this one, Tarantino could retire with a whimper.\n2 hours+ drained out of my life.", "One of the best movies": "I Put Once Upon a time in Hollywood in the bottom of my list for a very long time because i thought it would be boring but boy was i wrong.This film is a piece of art, i should have known tarantino is a master of details, this movie is very well shot and directed.The whole movie is a journey to the golden age of hollywood-The 1960s, you would really appreciate the film if you knew how many details in this movie are accurate and now comes the ending, I LOVED IT.The ending was so satisfying, this was tarantino's way of taking out his revenge fantasies on the Manson Family who were the cause of the end of the golden age of Hollywood.", "The Family Gets Theirs": "This was an enjoyable film and the comedy was just the right amount to make the characters interesting. The best part was how \"the Family\" got wasted in the end. That was very satisfying to say the least. Wish that had been how it happened in real life.", "Worst QT movie ever": "There was no story at all for the almost three-hour movie, just a \"situation\". There were no happenings, things were pretty much interrelated. No character development, no original dialogues. DiCaprio's character is completely forgettable, and Jason Statham would have been enough for the cast. Scenes last for minutes, irrelevant to the plot and mood, such as: Brad Pitt opens up a can of beer on the roof, or Brad Pitt drives the car. The film is a wreck structurally: the first two hours is boooooooring, followed by 40 minutes of fantasy, and finally 5 minutes of another booooooring.", "The last ten minutes were good": "Just fast forward to the last 10 minutes..you will missing nothing.", "Fantastic....But overrated, and not one of Tarantino's best": "EDIT: 0 out of 9 find this review helpful? Either y'all give this film way too much credit, or y'all sheep of the rottentomatoes group, which is full of conceited morons, btw. Or maybe a mix of BOTH. Either way, bite me.It's a fantastic throwback to the golden age of Hollywood, and 60's filmmaking. They did a PHENOMENAL job setting the atmosphere for 60's movie sets and the lives of a few fictional and non-fictional 60's movie stars, and used some excellent cinematography and story-telling tactics.So why was I disappointed? I think it's because Tarantino set such a high standard for himself, he's made it nearly impossible to surpass his pre-existing work. So far, nothing's been able to top \"Inglourious Basterds\" imo. Some films have come quite close, but in his world, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood falls quite a bit short.It's still an entertaining and worth-while cinematic achievement. No point in beating around the bush for this one; either you're gonna love it, or you're gonna like it.", "This movie blows.": "In view that this movie was nominated for a whole bunch of Oscars - and had the whole Hollywood establishment behind it - I feel pretty brave, in writing a scathing review about this highly acclaimed film :)So I think this movie blows; 'cos if you have a bad movie script, and put a whole lot of movie stars into it, you still have a bad film... But then again, a negative times a negative may result in some positive stuff as well.So on that note, I suppose this thing - whatever it was supposed to be - was a groovy parody of Hollywood life - as well as Washington DC. I also liked the cute actress who snored all the time. Also, the hero of the story - Rick Dalton - was quite well played by Leonardo DiCaprio, I think, portraying the strengths and vulnerabilities of this highly complex character.", "150 Minutes shot for the sake of the last 11": "Recreating an era is visually satisfying and DeCaprio and Pitt having fun playing their parts with gusto may be enough for the box office but shouldn't take that long to come to the final twist of the story.\nHitchcock was notorious to make a whole movie just to shoot one take or scene he really wanted to do but times have changed and one should get a little more substance in 150 minutes than perfect photography, a greatest hits of the era soundtrack and playful stars before you get to know that in 1968 Sergio Leone had a different approach to the past in his \"Once upon a time...\" than Tarantino has now.", "Tarantino Rocks!": "I am a fan of everything Tarantino. This film is his latest. I was never much of a Brad Pitt fan but his role in this movie has changed that. This is my favorite Brad Pitt movie. I love his character and his dog. Okay, the other guy is pretty good too. Lol. Can't wait to see this again.", "what the hell was this boring no story movie?": "This was really one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long while. There really isn't a real story and a lot of scenes are just dragging..\nIt's not a real coherend story, with only a few separate scenes spliced together. Friends of Tarantino show up on cue.. No real spicy dialogs as we're used to..\nSorry but people putting a 10 on this have been smoking what Pitt smoked near the end of the movie...\nThe acting itself is good, but sadly the story goes nowhere.. I had more fun watching an Uwe Boll movie than watching this Tarantino movie...", "Take A Ride Back In To Time...": "Set in the year of 1969 in Los Angeles, the world of TV and Cinema is beginning to change. Celebrity actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) begins to go through a personal crisis as he realises he is no longer the hottest actor in demand and finds himself acting in TV commercials or playing villain roles in Western films. By Rick's side and supporting him along the way is best friend and stunt-double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt).Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is a film that allows a cinema audience to sit on the side lines and experience the cinema world of 1969. Along with the main bromance between Rick and Cliff, the film also gives us an insight to many other well known actors. Some of these celebrities are also depicted during their personal highlights and challenges. The film also pays multiple tributes to classic films throughout the almost 3 hour duration, sometimes only quick moment which can almost be missed. I was also happy to see director Quentin Tarantino bring back many familar actors that we have seen in some his previously directed films, including Kurt Russell, Zoe Bell, Michael Madson and many more.As one would expect for a Quentin Tarantino flick, this film is very dialogue heavy. It is extremely obvious while watching the film that the director is passionate for film and cinema. Anyone who would call themselves a movie buff or cinephile will find lots to enjoy here with the many film reference and surprising tributes that are made, in particular to the actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).As for negatives there are a couple minor issues I had. Without giving away key spoilers, I can mention that the film did have one particular scene around the second act which did unfortunately drag on and didn't feel rewarding. The film's soundtrack is also a little dull here compared to previous Quentin Tarantino films. Naturally the film's biggest and best highlight is the relationship and humorous chemistry between actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Personally I would love to see these two work together again in due time.Overall, Director Quentin Tarantino delivers another outstanding film which is full of surprises and tense moments. Movie lovers will find much enjoyment throughout the film and enjoy the multiple references to the history of cinema and famous actors. Solid performances and chemistry between actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt is easily the biggest highlight of the film. Is it QT's best film? Well for me... sadly not, but there's still plenty Quentin Tarantino goodness and praise to be found here. 9.3/10 - Walkden Entertainment", "Boring, bornig and boring": "2 hours of completly nothing, and then in the end the final scene means nothing and is not linked to the central segment of the story. I'm not a fan of Tarantino but this is absolutly a waste of time", "Just too long.": "I'm no movie snob, the just know what I like. Enjoyed the movie, just thought they could have cut some of the Western bits.DeCaprio did a good job, but IMO, this is Pitt's movie.The ending made this movie, so endure 2+ hours of snooze fest and wait for it. It was worth it.", "A Good Film But not the Tarantino we're Used to": "Let me start off by saying this is a great film, the cast is stellar, the music, as they'd say in the sixties, is groovy and the story fun. I feel like Tarantino took some inspiration from American Graffiti for a lot of the film and, for someone who wasn't alive during the sixties I really got a feeling of what the time was like. Now, while this film was really good I did have a couple problems with it, firstly I feel the cinematography was fairly plain, I think that Hateful 8 showed some of the best cinematography of recent times and every film of Tarantino's I've seen before has felt really fresh with how things are being shot, not so much in Once Upon a Time. As well as this I would say that Margot Robbie, playing Sharon Tate, was under utilized with the character not feeling like they were contributing much to the story, lastly I will say that if you're a fan of Tarantino's usual bloody style you may be disappointed with this film which, apart from one scene towards the end has almost no action in it what so ever. I don't think this made the film worse in anyway but if you do come to Tarantino's work for gore this is something to be aware of.While this film feels like a love letter to the Hollywood of the sixties and does feature a great story, it feels like it doesn't live up to some of Tarantino's other features, worth a watch but may leave you underwhelmed.", "If you're a normal person, it SUCKS": "Excruciatingly boring... the last 10 minutes are okay but nothing amazing. None of the movie is amazing. I seriously think an eight year old could have come up with more entertaining scenes throughout the movie. Absolutely horrid waste of 2 and a half hours that I will never get back. Dreadfully slow. Some other reviews mention stuff about Tarantino, it's artsy, yada yada. I'm pretty into creative/artsy stuff myself and this movie is far from it, people are just trying to justify that it \"meant something\". Yes, things might have had a meaning in the movie... but it didn't make it any less BORING!", "Perfect period piece, imperfect plot": "\"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt was a thrill and deserves to be seen on the big screen.As expected from Tarantino, the film was marked by perfect direction, cinematography, editing, and in particular; production design. I felt totally immersed into 1969 Los Angeles. In spite of this, I felt the plot was rather less defined up against many of his other films, and especially considering its 161 minute runtime.Both leads nail their respective performances, but in particular Brad Pitt. Margot Robbie to me seemed almost unnecessary and more a great bill promotion rather than an actually adding quality to the film.The film held some plot-wise similarities to \"Inglourious Basterds\", but in my view had more charm and feel-good to its execution.To me, it stands as a chill-out film for casual viewing than a grand artistic statement.Highly recommended.", "Boring with no story": "A complete waste of 2 and a half hours. No story at all, no action and completely meaningless. It is as if Quentin Tarantino forgot that movies should have stories. A completely pointless movie", "GREAT MOVIE (But not for everyone)": "It's a masterpiece without a doubt. You can really see the effort that was put in to this movie.It's funny how in my view there were multiple leading-actors. Leo and Brad both had their own story but so similar either. It's just how they dealth with it that makes them different from each other.You should really see this movie multiple times. Some people in the review that they had nothing to talk about afterwards? I'm literally talking to myself about it. So clever how Rick Dalton always got killed because he was the bad guy. He evolved in a sort of way and took his chances with the bad guys coming at him. I won't spoil anything else but there's a ton of stuff I would like to discuss with all of you film lovers!A masterpiece for people who really love the industry.", "A must see": "This movie is quite different then the usual Quentin other movies. Is more smooth and sharper visual. And still have a touch of Quentin soul in it. It make you completely live the time and it's kinda sad with happy ending that never happened , I think this show us the more sensitive side of Quentin in some way. it's not bad at all but interesting.", "Great acting, no plot.": "Sure, the acting was spot on, but then that's exactly what you would expect from top actors like these.As for the plot, well, it's not there. There are 2 and a half hours of bits and pieces glued together by a narrator, followed by a 10-minute classic Tarantino gory scene and an ending that's completely irrelevant.", "Slow Roll and Then BANG": "The first two acts of this movie are admittedly campy and drawn out, but I can forgive all of the fluff for the last scene. Tarantino returns to the joy of many movie-goers. It was only slightly disturbing hearing all the applause for violence in the theater.", "You kidding me.": "Never written a review before on here, but needs be, fast forward to Bruce Lee part, then the end, save a couple a hours of your life, believe me.", "White Hollywood": "A film for white Hollywood about white Hollywood. Reminded me of a YouTube Vlogger, vlogging their life of doing nothing. If this didn't have the three star names attached to it no one would watch it the only saving grace is the cinematography. Disappointing", "Dissapointment": "I like Tarantino a lot, but I simply can't put this movie anywhere. The whole movie could fit in 20 minutes with credits, had no story or character development whatsoever. Had some entertaining moments but beside it was boring as hell.", "Mindless Entertainment": "All in all I have to say this movie is entertaining, I rather like the alternate Manson angle, but that being said what is the point? there are no clear goal this movie is working towards, a movie this long? well the last 10 minutes is by far the most exciting to watch.Dont Buy It, Rent It.", "fun and full of great performances!": "This movie is so delicious!A beautiful tribute to the golden age of hollywood Brad was impeccable in this movie, I love that Tarantino never leaves his 35mm camera.Acting, photography, soundtrack, plot...a wonderful movie!The movie is a little slow at first, but from the middle to the end everything gets better. I've seen it several times.Sorry, your review is too short. It needs to contain at least 600 characters. Sorry, your review is too short. It needs to contain at least 600 characters.

If you are like the rest of us you'll like the Bruce Lee fight and the last twenty or thirty minutes.", "Difficult to understand...": "And I think perhaps a little TOO difficult. I just didn't know what was happening. None of the characters sounded familiar to me, but I had the feeling like I was supposed to know them. There were scenes full of tension that, in my eyes, led to absolutely nothing. The ending made zero sense to me: I didn't know where those teenagers came from or how I was supposed to know them. I'm really bad at memorizing faces, so maybe they did appear in the movie once or twice, but it just wasn't enough for me to recognize them.Only when I was done watching, still throwing up because of a few gruesome scenes that happened without warning, I decided to look up what the hell it all meant, if it even meant anything. Apparently, the movie is based on a real tragedy or a murder that took place in Hollywood years ago. However, I know nothing of Hollywood's history, so I didn't understand any references that were made.I think the movie could be really cool and surprising to people who know Hollywood's history. However, I'm rating this based on my own experience: confusion, boredom, sickness and a lack of sleep.", "Tarantino returns": "Tarantino's latest film starring Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie has been hyped up for ages and was one of my most anticipated films of the year. To a certain extent the Tarantino esque filmmaking style is definitely a stable of this movie,from the over the top violence and dialogue to the small details seen in Tarantino's film. Once upon a time in Hollywood definitely delivered the familiar dose of Tarantino's style that was definitely the main draw and what I liked most about this movie.However, outside of that I did find that the pay off and converging storylines did not deliver the impact that most of Tarantino's movies do. It unfortunately ended up being rather bland and inconsequential, seemingly shoehorning in the Manson storyline for the sake of doing so, and writing an alternate history for the sake of doing so; rather than letting the characters drive the story.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood had great performances and tried introduced themes of duality and facade. Taking on the superficial 'look' of the glamorous Hollywood era of movie stars and examines this cultural phenomenon closely, however pales in comparison with Tarantino's impressive filmography.", "A Film Fans' Film - It gets better and better each time": "First viewing - the end credits......I sat there a while and had no feeling, it was weird! I liked everything in it, I loved the cinematography, the comedy, the story, the nod to Hollywood classic genres, everything but it felt there was not much of a conclusion.It rattled me for a good week or so. All that hype, a year of waiting for Pitt and DiCaprio together - side by side in a Tarantino movie. Was it all too much? Was I swallowed by the hype? Maybe.So, I went back to the cinema. It flew by, there was no pressure, it was pure cinema indulgence, It was a FILM FANS FILM. I appreciated every touch. It's not a singular story beginning-middle-end......it is Tarantino after all.But it's a moment of time.You're in then you're out.It's beautiful man.", "I have no idea why this has such a high rating here .": "I had to write a review for this one, just as a warning to others. I have lost over 2 hours of my life on this drivel. No spoilers here.This so-called movie is very superfluous. It literally ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story line is so thin that it really don't contain one. I kept hoping and hoping that is would get better and then all of a sudden it did, for the last ten minutes, and even that wasn't spectacular.Quentin, I don't know what is wrong with you but you seriously need to snap out of it. What a waste of good talent and why did they agree to star in this terrible movie? All I can think is it's all about the money.This is not even a B movie, it's somewhere closer to Z.IT REALLY IS AWFUL!Read the low ratings for this movie, they are very correct.", "\"Hey You!\" (Punch to the face)": "I watched \"Once Upon A Time\" lastnight and I must say it wasnt quite what I expected. This is the newest(9th) film from Tarantino, tho when I look into his pedigree of work I see he has directed more than 9 feature films...so idk why they say it's his 9th.. But nonetheless, \"Once Upon A Time\" is not a good movie. It is a dumb movie and besides the Manson aspect, this film has absolutely no story. At all. Like honestly if there was going to be a film made with one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood wouldn't you think there would be a few more entertaining bits? I am a severe film critic and fan and am very generous and open minded when watching films. I don't care what reviews say; I make up my own mind. I watch b films, indie films, cinematic films, and Hollywood epics. I must say that the indie horror film made on a $100,000 that I watched the night before was better than this trash. I call it trash, however, I will say this was my favorite depiction of the Manson Cult on film yet. I really liked the movie \"Charlie Says\" and although as a whole that is a better movie, I still think \"Once Upon A Time\" portrays the cult in a scarier, more frightening way. This leads me to my main issue.... This movie should have been a close examination of the events from the surrounding days of the Tate murders. Yes, that has been done several times and in my opinion, done well, but I think this would have been the best depiction of the events YET and still kind of IS even for how little it showed. Basically it's a huuuge opportunity missed on Tarantino's part. Again, the Manson scenes were by far the most entertaining and even tense but there was too little of them. Right when I eased into the serious tension and started to feel a smile slide up my face the scene was over.. Too bad. The first hour could be completely cut from the movie as it feels pointless and a waste. Leo didn't do such a good acting job and it's safe to say this is his worst film in awhile. He took a serious salary cut for this film and it shows in his on screen passion. Brad Pitt did a good job even tho at times he felt wooden. I think that was just his character but idk why Tarantino would write him that way. One of the biggest faults of the film is the way it is formatted and executed. It feels like a series of vignettes all tied together. It does have that Tarantino feel to it but just barely. This is definitely Tarantino's most different film. His alien if you will. Again, this movie should have been a crime/thriller about the Manson murders and the story of Sharon Tate. NOT a movie about a dull and boring fading movie and TV actor who sucks at his job now. Overall it's a big pointless mess of a film and the praise startles me. It's clear the hype is all due to the director behind it but believe it or not, even the greats aren't perfect. Even Michael Jordan had off games", "A little messy and erratic, but very entertaining": "This film is a little all over the map. It never stays at one speed for long, and it springs back and forth jarringly such that it almost feels like 3 act play written by 3 different Tarantinos. The mid-late film feels particularly rushed. Instead of the tension building to a natural crescendo, there is an overused narrator who advances time with a lot of exposition. All I could think was \"Show! Don't tell.\" Despite the jarring tonal shifts and pacing that feels constantly unsettled. it is very entertaining throughout. The performances are solid, DiCaprio and Pitt both channel their star-power to great dramatic and comedic effect, and there is a fine supporting cast. Yet, Margot Robbie as Tate goes heavily underutilized, and it's bizarre. For the amount of screen time, she is little more than eye-candy, and she has no particular character arc or importance to the story. At the end of the day, I can't help but feel that this film didn't really have much to say. It feels overstuffed and indulgent. The commentary on Hollywood, TV/Film, Celebrity, Hippies, the 60s/70s is all pretty muddy. But, alas, it's still a very good time, and maybe it doesn't need to be anything more than a big Hollywood fantasy...a fairy tale created in Hollywood about Hollywood, and that's sort of the point and part of the charm.", "Really well done": "It's really well acted and directed. I never watch films more than once and I watched this three times already.", "Fantastic film, plus hippies get beat up and killed": "One of Tarantino's best. Well worth the watch. If only to just enjoy watching dirty hippies get beat up, bludgeoned, torched, eunichized and killed, it is well worth the >2 hours length. Great story. Do not miss it!", "Enjoyable": "I was really excited for this movie. And although the acting absolutely didn't disappoint, I feel like there is at least 45 minutes that should have been cut. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen to push the story along the entire time. The ending was awesome and such a a great surprise but 15 minutes of fun at the end doesn't quite make up for being bored the rest of the movie. I will say this was some of the best acting we have seen from the two main stars and Margot Robbie lit up the screen for her scenes. Worth watching just hang in there.", "Tarantino is a gift to cinema, but he needs a film editor pronto.": "Tarantino's films are long, sometimes TOO LONG, like this review lol but usually I don't mind this, because the scene setting and dialogue is phenomenal, and makes it all worth the 5 minutes you just saw someone ride around with one foot out the car window or smoke a cigarette as if it is the last one on earth.But in this case, the dialogue was not up to my expectations and I could not relate with with the privilege Hollywood of old, has-been, nostalgia that was mostly the theme of the movie.I will say this though, it is a reimagining of real life events, so knowing more about them may help, I sadly did not know this until after. Always avoiding spoilers did not work out this time around.I must admit anytime Leonardo DiCaprio or Brad Pitt were on the screen the movie shined, but Tarantino overindulged too much on others, and those scenes were not fun or helped develop much.Now that I know what it was based on, I now understand why the characters were there, but regardless the movie dragged at times.I give it a 6.5/10!.... because there was a good \ud83d\udc36 dogo.Watch it at home. And fast forward any time Brad or Leonardo take too long to appear again.", "A pure waste of time": "I have wasted almost 3 hours of my life watching this nonsense.

Yes, Brad Pitt is giving a masterclass in acting, but what's the purpose.... and what is Margot Robbie's part contributing to this movie....I found the movie very boring and above all, the worst Tarantino movie so far.", "Not what I was expecting.": "Very entertaining Quentin Tarentino view of late 1960's Hollywood. I had a sense of dread as this movie progressed but it turned in a way I was not expecting. The dread I felt was due to remembering so clearly, the fateful morning I bought a paper and read the headlines about the slaying of Sharon Tate, pregnant at the time, and her friends by the Charles Manson brainwashed followers, the most horrendous event ever to come out of Hollywood. Younger viewers who were not born until later would not know about this other than what they may gave read but it was truly chilling at the time. Tarantino has his own version which I will not spoil but it's an alternative chain of events. If only. Brad Pitt gives the standout performance of the film and his career bagging an Oscar for supporting actor. It hooked me because of the sense I felt throughout of impending doom, particularly as he keeps showing scenes with Margot Robbie playing Sharon. I was rather glad it was different.", "Let me tell you why": "I'll tell you why this movie didn't even come close to being \"Best Picture\" at the Oscars.It wasn't very good, that's why.Although the acting by Leo was just great and Brad Pitt was his usual brutally handsome presence, that wasn't enough to carry the project to its \"long time a- comin'\" finale.Most of the Tarantino movies I have seen, even though they are gruesome blood fests, have good plot development , good tension and good soundtracks but this one had none of the above.The music was too loud and Tarantino relied on it too much to set the 70's scenes rather than trying to pull more out of the characters .Those characters, other than Leo and Brad, were just empty vessels and the whole set up echoed with the sound of one hand clapping.As for tension, well, because he was keeping the twist of the ending a secret (and a very well kept secret at that) he wasn't able to build anything in unfolding the story.\nA few good fight episodes eased the tedium but overall it was a travelogue type movie, which is very unusual for QT.The bottom line is that there was something less than gripping with this project, showing that you only have to be slightly off your best to turn out a mediocre product...... and this is definitely not his best.For all that negative stuff, it's still a movie that holds your attention and entertains, so I would recommend watching it ... just temper your expectations.", "Absolutely nonsense for over 2 hours 30 minutes": "Well, that's the worst tarantino film I could possibly imagine.Absolutely nothing at all happens for the whole film until 15 minutes before the end.I sat with my wife and repeatedly said to her 'what is this film actually about'.Utter utter garbage with no resemblance of a story at all.Save some of your life and watch soemthi g else. As I tarantino fan I am hugely disappointed with it.", "Nothing new. Bonny and Clyde style story.": "Showing unnecessary violence and raw using raw language always does not make a authentic film. Weak story line.", "An Emblem of Cinematography": "A startling cast under the control of a sensational director cooks up the perfect film to indulge in the comedic yet dramatized genre. A classic 'what-could-have-been takes us back 60 years and tells an unforgiving tale in an elaborate and alternative way.Rick, a washed-out actor, and Cliff, his stunt double, struggle to recapture fame and success in 1960s Los Angeles. Meanwhile, living next door to Rick is Sharon Tate and her husband Roman Polanski.The film touches on serious philosophical subjects in a fantastical manner while also using primitive methods to display the chain of events unfolding in front of its viewers eyes, testing the quality of acting on show, while Tarantino simply shows off. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie all play diametric foils of one another, which is why they click with such humour and ease, the bubbly, vibrant Sharon Tate, the cool, slick Cliff Booth and the composed, professional Rick Dalton combine to seal the movie's success. $374.6 million in the Box Office and 2 Academy Award wins, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood took to the cinemas by storm, a 'must-watch' production that was best suited for the big screen, the genius behind the spectacle is in the picture, 1960s LA displayed with fine realism, the bright, bustling streets contrasting to the desolate, isolated desert provide the ideal setting of a film featuring conflict.The characters - as touch on previously - are portrayed expertly, which purposely offer the light-hearted gesture to its viewers, an iconic scene with Bruce Lee springs to mind as well as a particularly loyal dog. The film is one inspired by true events and emphasises how things could've been different; everyone bought into Tarantino's different approach to the film with much credit needed for the writers. A smart script including comedy in all the right places and key language which contributed to the direction of the movie.

I found myself looking at the time wondering if the film would end and put itself out of its misery. If this is a new genre of movie, as some have said, it will fall onto the list of genres that I won't pay to see...nor...watch at home. A waste of time...and...the cost of admission.The clever lines in the script that are so typical of QT's movies fail to make an appearance. The opening 1-1/2 hours is like watching paint dry. This is an amazing cast...all lending their vast talents yo the film. Individual characters were good, but unlike QT's other movies where every scene is stellar, this film flames out. The bottom line for me...a very long movie that fails to have much to offer.Ironically...a film about a has been actor is a bit like a director foreshadowing his career crashing with releases such as this.QT...have you forgotten what has made your films so notable and great?With more films like this that would appear to be the case.", "Hollywood Self Aggrandizing Nonsense BS": "Watch the last 20 minutes.

It meanders and changes scene just when you think you've got it sussed. There are some fantastic scenes, many which are totally evocative of the time and the place. Background sound, TV & radio for instance often set the scene. Leonardo and Brad & Margot are providing an acting class, pulling you into their respective characters. They make you forget your earlier questioning about where this film is going. It's like the stranger giving you a lift knows someone you know and he is no longer the stranger that you thought.\nThen pow - it turns out he's deranged and only then do you realise that the film has reached its climax.\nIts good, great, and a little bit not good.

Maybe he remember people like this from him and he just make his funs happy.\nThe most interesting for me is to see people trying to give some explanation or analises to justify 10 stars, as if his idol can never commit mistakes. I am pretty sure that if Tarantino try to create a disaster movie just to test his funs, a real bad movie on purpose, for a test, his funs are gonna find a way to give 10 stars and right \"genius\".", "Context is necessary to appreciate this film": "\"When you come to the end of the line, with a buddy who is more than a brother and a little less than a wife, getting blind drunk together is really the only way to say farewell.\"\n-NarratorFirst of all let me say that in order to truly appreciate this movie you need A LOT of context; I mean names and faces (of The Manson Family, their victims, and Hollywood stars), movies and pop-culture references, locations, dates and specific times, etc. The first time I watched the movie I lacked some of this context and left feeling a little disappointed considering I am a huge fan of Tarantino, but once you have the context this movie becomes Tarantino's sweet, sweet \"revenge\" against The Manson Family. Brad Pitt is amazing in this movie and creates one of the funniest, most likable characters I have seen in a long time. Everyone else also does a great job with their characters and I have to respect the fact that Tarantino portrayed Tate as somewhat of an unknown in the industry (which she most likely was considering she only had a couple of well known movies under her belt). The one issue I had with the movie is that I felt like Tarantino went a bit too strong with his references and satirical commentary (especially in scenes with DiCaprio). These references and commentaries sometimes felt somewhat disconnected from the plot and unlike other Tarantino films did not really connect at the end of it. But overall this is a beautiful film, extremely funny, and I am certain that Tarantino gives us an ending we wish had materialized in real life.", "Once upon a time in Tarantino's mind": "Acting: 5\nStory: 5\nProduction values: 6\nSuspence - thriller level: 7\nAction: 5\nMystery - unknown: 5\nRomance level: 2\nComedy elements: 4\nOverall: 5", "Edit issues, waste of time": "Despite huge fan of the cast.. this movie is the waste of time\nThey thought whatever they deliver people gona like it, however major editing issues", "Funny, but laborous": "Quentin Tarantino creates like no film student can.

Even in my case I hated reservoir dogs and hateful 8, but loved kill bill and django. With this Quentin Tarantino movie its no different, but in my case I loved it, and here's why.Plot:\nThe plot is slow like a lot of Quentin's other movies. It was boring sometimes but if you arnt distracted you should be interested enough with the crazy good replication of old Hollywood and the protagonists. The ending was great, I just wished there was a little more scenes like the end, but it is still a enjoyable film.Acting:\nWow, the acting like everyone would predict is fantastic from Brad Pitt, leonardo, and everyone else involved. It has a massive cast of A listers who do a great job with what they're given. Like I said, with Quentin's films they are slow and sometimes boring. However brad Pitt's scenes were my favorite and were great throughout.Cinematography:\nThis is a special film that has such a huge budget and director that it is extremely detailed and a special experience to see. All the way through costume design, sets, camera shots, symbolism and references is great.Conclusion:\nThis is not for everyone, but if you dont mind slow going plots and Tarantino's style of film making then you'll love this film. Its special and deserves a watch, in my case very enjoyable.", "Best ending ever!": "That's all I have to say. Best ending ever!

It's not...": "This movie is a waste of time. If you are going for the story of Sharon Tate like I did don't go. You will be thoroughly disappointed. I was super excited for this. Even more so when I heard who was going to be playing Sharon. But I felt like I was betrayed when this movie was over. Out of all filmmakers on the scene I never would have thought Tarantino would be the one to disappoint with the graphic nature of the story. He took a great concept and ruined it.

Almost like, lets go crazy last 15mins because it hasn't been done yet and this is a QT movie? Al pacinos role seemed pointless, just an excuse to cast him somewere, in my opinion. And sadly i feel somewhat the same about Margot robbies character too. It seemed like her whole role was just a homage to Sharon tate?? It didnt have a place in the movie, Or maybe it was just put there to connect the film to hippy followers of charles manson?

So I watch this movie and I laugh at very funny scenes I didn't understand why people where upset about the Bruce lee thing I thought that was really good it's undoubtedly Brad Pitt's greatest performance and Leo's but overall felt bland and upsetting because I wanted it to be so much. Ok I'll start with what I liked, I loved the music,cars,clothes,cinematography,acting,directing. What I didn't like was the wasted plot lines such as Charles Manson who is in the movie for about a minute and that's it. I thought the breakout star was Margaret qualley I apologise if I misspelled but she was fantastic but if this was directed by anyone else I'd go WOW ! But for a master such as Quentin Tarantino it was a true let down", "Not worth it !": "I went to see this movie with lot of expectations..but it badly fall short of it.

The movie is boring,only the last part is funny and few parts inside. Brad Pitt very cool and chill character apparently he kill his wife and get away with that ha,ha,plus the dog was brilliant,goes above the Leonardo Dicaprio . Funny Kurt Russel with wife,ha,ha But I must say Tarantino did great atmosphere of 1969 in 2019 ,perfect and also changed the story of Sharon Tate ,he save her and her friends in this movie,but we all know they are dead for the last 50 years RIP.", "Brad, the 2 girls and the dog.....": "They steal the film. Leo still can't act. Predictable mostly. Visually authentic but in the end, boring.", "Some brilliant, some mediocre elements": "I don't watch many Tarantino movies. This movie caught my curiosity because it didn't focus on violence and contained some history (of which I had no idea what it was when I watched the film - I had read almost nothing about the film, so, I didn't recognise the Manson connection).In many ways Tarantino superbly captured the free-spirited 60s, a time when society was easy going and nowhere near as hung up as it is today. Many modern portrayals of the 60s can only be described as heavily \"revisionist\" by failing to capture the free-loving and easy going spirit that is no longer seen today. People being sexually liberated and carefree is hard to capture in a film today, not just because of media outrage, but, because those elements are no longer found today and people would find it hard to get back into that mindset. However, Tarantino did a great job of capturing that spirit.Sadly, there are two things that annoy me about the film. Firstly, Julia Butters (playing Trudi Fraser) is a blaring anachronistic character. This obnoxious character is someone you would find today, not in the more carefree 60s. A child who behaved arrogantly like this would have been frowned upon almost universally. It strikes me odd that Tarantino was sniped by a similar personality from the New York Times. However, Tarantino thinks that feeding narcissists will appease narcisissts. How wrong he is!Lastly, the violence in the film is over the top. I understand this is Tarantino signature. This is probably why I don't watch more Tarantino flicks. The over-the-top violence was meaningless and added nothing to the film.Overall, the acting was solid. Most of the characterisation of the 60s (except Trudi Fraser) were exceptionally well done. Fraser's character was an anachronysm, typical of most other modern revisionism. Overall, an entertaining story. Pitt was excellent as was Robbie.", "Too long and very slow": "To categorize this as comedy is wrong. I didn't hear people laughing at the cinema. The story is boring and it's difficult to stay awake watching the movie. The only thing I can say about this movie is to recommend highly to not watch it.", "One of the lamest movies of all time": "This was the dumbest and most boring movie that I have ever seen until the last 15 minutes. I couldn't believe that DiCaprio and Pitt would waste their time with this nonsense. Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are 10s and this is a big fat ZERO. Do not waste your time or money.", "One of the best movies in a while": "I had no ideas about the Tate story before watching the movie. Some scenes / plots may seem unnecessary if you don't have the context, but I've still found movie entertaining and impressive even without the context.I like how Rick and Chris are portrayed in the movie. I was able to get to know really well in a 2.5 hour time span. I like Chris a lot. A guy who doesn't have much career but takes pride in his physical strength / integrity and has no fear. Rick can be lazy and emotional sometimes, but is constantly pursuing to get his career back on track.After watching the movie, I learned about the Tate story. I was able to recall details / scenes / plots of the movies that i previously found unnecessary, brilliant and very detailed oriented. The movie strikes a really good balance between the historical facts and the imaginary elements of the story. I'd definitely watch this movie again. Highly recommend this.", "A good movie, another alternate reality effort": "Tarantino is in the zenith of his alternate reality movie phase. In this effort, we see a glimpse of the life of Hollywood actors, complete with an alternative \"what if\" idea of what if the Manson criminals had instead \"picked the wrong house\" to attack?But, in spite of that quirky aspect, the real purpose of this movie, and its real exploration, is of a person in history that we got to see far too little of, actress Sharon Tate, who in reality was murdered by the Manson thugs far too early in her life.Margo Robbie made this movie! Her presentation is of a sweet and charming young woman, full of life and happiness. And in her presentation, some of the \"what if\" of Sharon Tate's unfulfilled life is played out before us. As the final scene is played out, and the movie title is strategically saved to the very end, we are left with the sense of sadness about how one small group of psychopaths can destroy a life full of interest.Concurrently, the movie explores another theme of the older actor filled with personal doubt and paranoia that his career is winding down in an industry well known for its fickle nature and quick loss of status for roles.The main take away is nostalgia, for a time in 1969 when Hollywood was in many respects at its high water mark for relevance and financial influence. The moral lesson is that the Manson murders may have represented the beginning of the slide of lost dreams and destroyed futures, all of which may have been avoided if the Mansons had simply picked the \"wrong\" house to attack!", "Take off your Tarantino hat": "Whether you choose to watch this movie based on who the Director is or who the actors are, make sure you get yourself comfortable for a steady, sometimes witty, strong script for character development. If you want guns, gore, and those classic scenes which possibly drove you to think of watching this movie, look elsewhere.However, you will not find many better films this year that tell a true account of developing a set of characters to tell a story which finally (you'll get what I mean) reaches its crescendo and boy when it does, you don't want anyone else to take you through it other than Quentin Tarantino.Brad Pitt gave a stellar performance, Leo was good but just short of the mark of 'Leo great', and Mrs Robbie, the jury is still out on a few charges, but she offers a strong foothold in the story so just bear with that.", "Really bad": "You are looking for 2,5 hours to absolutely nothing. Nothing happens, it is completely boring.

The next several years of the 1970s were a pale reflection of 1964 through 1969 and then Disco ended it all. I watch shows to see how closely they come to the actual time period and I'm invariably disappointed. Man From Uncle tried but got 1962 through 1969 hopelessly muddled. Once Upon A Time did a better job of recreating 1969 but still missed it. It seemed I was watching 2019 people trying to act like it was 1969 and, as they weren't alive then, not getting it. In 1969 the country and indeed the world was being run by people born from 1900 to 1920 and they were still around but not seen in this movie. There were hats, and wide ties from the 50s and narrow ties from the 60s and short sleeve white shirts and black ties with silver tie clasps and there were still 1950s cars on the street. Watch Bullet or some of the other movies from the 60s or even newsreels and you'll see what I mean. It wasn't the nostalgic trip I was hoping for but I'll still see it again. Brad Pitt was great and the rest did just fine also. The ending was pure Tarantino. UPDATE: Saw it again. It's even better the 2nd time because you've had time to digest the ending and can pay more attention to the details before the ending.", "8 stars just because this movie appears to have cut scenes and because of the stupid portrait of Bruce.": "Good movie, excellent recitation. It's a pity that Nicholas Hammond has not get an Oscar for his extraordinary performance. Another problem on this movie. Many of the characters Tarantino describes are stereotyped. So Bruce Lee doesn't appear as Bruce Lee is, but as many of Chinese Bruce Lee's characters he played in his movies before the Enter the Dragon character which is a bit different from its predecessors. So it seems that Tarantino ridicules Bruce Lee which deserves a lot of respect as a person rather than just as a martial artist. A severe error Tarantino made on Bruce that I hope he will fix with a movie about Bruce Lee.", "2.5 Hours wasted 10 minutes Tarantino action": "The dog Brandy and the 60's cars gets two of my stars.The rest was boring , a lot of unnecessary scenes and indifferent caracters.

Bored with the film industry?": "Terrible movie: too boring, too long and with a horrible plot (if there's any). I do love all Tarantino's movies, except for this one.

The first hour and a half of this film I really didn't like, it drags heavily and I found myself dosing off at times. But on the other hand, the last hour was absolutely amazing and I loved every second of it.\nI have to give this film the benefit of the doubt though and give this a solid rating.The first half of the film I feel has some pacing issues with some long drawn out shots that I feel are unnecessary and make the hour and a half seem a lot longer than it is.\nThe second half is really what redeems it for me, it seems a lot faster paced and does the whole film more of a justice. And holy, the last 30 minutes are amazing and so outlandishly crazy compared to the rest of the film.\nAll throughout the film the cinematography was great, as to expect from a Tarantino piece. The acting, though could be better, was still great and I was very invested in Brad Pitts character all the way through. And although there were moments that reminded me that I was watching a Tarantino film, the majority of the time I didn't get that same charm or spark I feel with a typical Tarantino film. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just something to point out when being compared to his past 8 works.\nI saw this when it was first released in 2019, or should I say forced to see it with some friends. And I think it would be an understatement to say I despised this film. Was I hard on this film? Extremely. Do I wish I could rewatch it for the first time again with a better outlook? Of course. Do I think it's better now that I wanted to watch it and will never go see a movie against my will again? Yes.", "Unedited boredom": "The script is weak, nothing happens in the first 2/3 of the movie.

Not even sure why MR or AP even accepted those roles... may be some quick money they needed which is better than personal loan, I guess.\nJust don't watch it.

Sets design and good performances by Pitt & Caprio are the main highlights of the film, not the best work of Tarantino but surely not the worst as screen play had not much to offer \".\nThis is a one time watch movie if you have enough time to as length of the movie is also one of the issue.", "Mostly restrained Tarantino that is one of his best movies": "Tarantino is growing older, and this film, along with his previous picture, the mostly hated but still well-done \"Hateful Eight,\" are slow burns. His days of torture scenes, jamming hypodermic needles into chests, swordplay in sushi bars, and smashing the heads of Nazis with baseball bats apparently behind him, QT fashioned a 1969 Los Angeles-set comedy/thriller/fantasy, containing appealing performances and impeccable set design.Leo DiCaprio, ever the Oscar darling, didn't get a nomination for his performance of Rick Dalton, former B&W TV western star, now relegated to playing villains in shows like \"The FBI.\" Perhaps the Academy felt that his recent nominations and win for \"The Revenant\" were sufficient. Oscar's attention in 2019 instead went to his co-star Brad Pitt, who plays his easygoing stunt double who has a questionable past.As the case with Inglorious Basterds, QT is heavy on the history re-writing; this time instead of Nazis, the group that gets it are Charles Manson's mostly female followers, who decide to break into not Polanski and Tate's house at the end of the movie, but Dalton's. QT fans ready for violence had to wait nearly three hours to get it, but the violence delivers.What makes this film so fabulous is not the violent ending, but the characterizations, the believable story of a \"washed up\" actor having to go to Rome to make movies, his loyal stunt double who becomes his best friend, and the set design. This is what LA and Hollywood looked like in 1969, with the neon, the drive-in movie theaters, the cars, the random oil wells, the parties in Laurel and Topanga Canyons. The movie was released the same year as the love letter to Laurel Canyon documentary \"Echo in the Canyon,\" a movie that would, along with QT's film, make for a great double feature (and to make it a Laurel Canyon/LA in the late '60s triple feature, add Jacques Demy's 1969 film Model Shop).Viewers on IMDb calling this movie \"boring\" must have been expecting nonstop Kill Bill action. QT is not at that stage of his career (and life) anymore. I've read in various articles that \"OUAT...IH\" may be his final film. Surely a better final film instead of the \"Kill Bill Vol. 3\" that some fans are waiting/hoping for.", "I don't know how to describe it": "It took two hours to go back to Hollywood half a century ago and bury a bunch of mines. In the last 20 minutes, it was detonated with a not-so-new creative chain, but the effect was very good. Surprise to the explosion, perhaps the best for Sharon Tate. The way to pay homage. Sure enough, it is the least spoilers of the year.This is the gentlest movie to Hollywood and the most vicious movie to Bruce Lee. Quentin used a movie to round out the California dream of all Hollywood filmmakers, but woven a vicious spider web in the hearts of Chinese fans.

He and his stunt double are hopeful that the good times are not yet over.Featuring delightful star 'cameos' and lavish shots which ooze 60's nostalgia, OUATIH makes no attempt to be follow any genre rules. The story, at face value appears to be mundane and a bit pointless.If you know nothing of the history surrounding this moment in time, the movie will appear to be going nowhere but I was feeling the crushing tension of what was building, very slowly, throughout the film.It's hard to talk at length without revealing too much; the finale was, for me, a triumph.OUATIH is filled with Tarantino's shameless, naive exuberance and will either have you buzzing or groaning by the end.

The movie by director Quentin Tarantino. So let's see what Trip has to say.Trip Fontaine: Most fairy tales begin with those famous four word: once upon a time. Quentin Tarantino's 9th film as writer and director, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, alludes to the promise and magical romanticism of those children's stories. While not necessarily a fairy tale, this film leans into the romanticism of Hollywood and the despair of when the realization of the Hollywood dream begins to slip or is otherwise threatened.Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is an aging television and movie actor in the 1950's and 60's, whose career is on a downturn. His confidante, assistant and longtime stunt double is Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt. The main plot of Dalton and Booth is a little bit character study of two actors, who must come to terms with the impending end of an era, and a little bit of a buddy dramedy in which each willfully supports the other. The subplot involves a rising starlet, Sharon Tate, played by Margot Robbie. Tarantino firmly sets the main action of the film in 1969, a turning point in American counterculture, which is particularly resonant considering the other characters that are encountered throughout.For the uninitiated, it may be a good idea to do a quick Google search: Who is Sharon Tate? If you don't already know a little bit about the actress, it may be helpful in orienting yourself on the time and significance of both Tate and the mysterious hippies Cliff meets. While not strictly necessary for enjoyment of the film, it does add some rich texture to where Tarantino is taking us. There's some joy, but also impending doom.At 2 hours and roughly 40 minutes runtime, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood tells its story with a deliberate pace. This runtime is pretty standard for a Tarantino film. It doesn't feel like there is a wasted moment. The core contrast between Dalton's downward career trajectory and Tate's promise of future stardom is enhanced by DiCaprio's almost manic desperation as Dalton tries to save the parts he is getting and Robbie's luminous sequence reveling in watching Tate on the big screen. Pitt has never been his Pitt-est than as Cliff - he's confidant and brash, no nonsense with a sense of humor. There is a hilarious scene between Pitt and Mike Moh, as Bruce Lee, that will be one of the most talked about. It all comes together, so surprisingly, in the last 20 or so minutes that you walk out a bit dazed and giddy. And, if you know the history, it is satisfyingly bittersweet as well.For Tarantino fans and true Cinephiles, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is a must see in the movie theaters. Get your tub of popcorn (and other snacks) and settle in for movie stars being movie stars and a film-loving director directing a film about loving films. For the rest, I still suggest seeing this movie in the theaters. Tarantino films are meant to be seen on the big screen.Thanks Trip for your review, I agree with you completely. The acting are Leo and Brad at their typical best and thus Tarantino also rebounding to his best after the Hateful Eight. There are two points I want to drive home for general moviegoers, aka the non-Tarantino fans or non-Cinephiles. First, general moviegoers, this is honestly a borderline matinee film for you based on the length of the film and because of point number two. Point two is that you if you don't know who Sharon Tate is, you will be lost in the theater and will overlook the brilliance of the story being told to you to make this a definite big box film. I almost want to say don't look up who she is until after the film because that just might enhance you intrigue in the movie and make you want to see it again for certain easter eggs.Long story short, for general moviegoers catch the matinee if anything, but if you know the story of Sharon Tate, then this will be a great film to see in theaters.", "A rough diamond": "There was so much I liked about this film but, and it's a big but, it TRULY felt like a rough cut edit of a final film.A sharper more satisfying film was so close to the surface I felt - especially in the first 2 hours. In many ways it reminded me of how I felt about Death Proof (or my 'recollection' of how I felt about Death Proof - I watched that a long time ago!) which was that the preamble was just about worth sitting through to get to the climax.Anyway, I'd read enough to know the first two hours were slow so I prepared myself for it, expecting I could withstand a meandering love letter to Hollywood, but even with this knowledge I genuinely struggled with some of the longueurs.Having said all that it is still worth seeing and there's many moments that show Tarantino can still surprise and delight. I just wish he had more trust in an editor at this stage of his career. It would do him the world of good I feel.", "Excessively long until they arrive at Ranch": "There were two story lines basically . A) the life of movie star Rick Dalton on set B) Brad Pitt after he picks up the hitch hiker. Then a climax. After watching this film, storyline a is way way way too long. Almost 2 hours. It's a unique film as it potrays life on a movie set I suppose but I didn't fancy watching Leonardo DiCaprio \" as an actor acting as an actor \"...for two hours . Only once Brad Pitt arrives at the Ranch is when things really start to become intriguing. Looking back on the film now, the first part did not have to be that long. The only thing that connects the climax to story line A is that the characters are the same. Nothing that happened Rick Dalton shooting scenes (story line A) had anything to do with the ending of the movie really.", "Good actor, but bad story": "Good actor, but bad story.The talent of the director was only shown in the last half hour of the film", "What storyline???": "I am not necessarily a QT fan, or a Leonardo fan, or a Brad Pitt fan. I am just a fan of a good movie, and I just do not know how this is a good movie.The acting from the two lead actors is great yes, but where is the story guys?? I think somewhere half way through the movie I wanted to look at my phone and see how long the movie had got left...What does the character and the story line of \"Sharon Tate\" have anything to do with anything? She lives next door, she goes to see a film in which herself acted, takes a selfie in front of the movie poster, explains a little how she became a dirty movie actress, feels tired from her pregnancy and in the last 3 mins, her storyline merges FINALLY with the main one. Maybe I am not artistic enough to understand the subtleties of QT films, but this character literally has 0 thing to do with the whole film. In this sense, even the poster of this movie is a scam.I don't know what message this film is trying to send, or what inspirations it is trying provoke because I honestly feel none. It is almost like one of those movies - you see some action but there is no story. It is utterly bland, long and boring. And it's even worse than it would normally be because it's made by one of the most celebrated directors and 2 of the most talented actors alive in Hollywood.", "Part 3: alternative endings to actual events, a proposal": "On the 10th of september 2001, Jack (played by Chuck Norris) is having a bad day. His wife just left him, his job with the Russian mob as a kung fu hitman is going through some rough patches and his mistress is pregnant with triplets (girls).To blow of some steam he decides to go party in Boston with his good buddy Frank (Steven Seagal). They take a lot of drugs and do silly things. When in the middle of doing all these silly things, they run into a group of five nervous and overagitated young men.Things take a turn for the worse. Jack and Frank end up killing all five in terrible but very creative and inventive ways. They head on home to New York on flight 11 the next day with a crazy hangover.The End", "Nostalgia all over the place": "When you love the old movies and old tv series and much mure about that era, fifties, sixties. seventies.This movie will suit you just fine.Great acting by all leads, Pitt and DeCaprio have stand-out performances.Instant classic if you ask me.Try and see it.", "Definitely Worth Watching": "While I must admit It did take me about a half an hour to really get into this movie. But after that I was hooked to the screen. The story was very interesting and the cinematography is outstanding. You can really tell this was made by somebody who loves the art of filmmaking. The acting of course is top-notch. You can't go wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt. Those two scenes with Leo and the flame thrower were my favourite scenes in the movie. I enjoyed watching the film overall and would recommend watching it.", "Hate Tarantino": "Loss of 2:45 hours for tarantino!!!!!\nActually the play of the stars are great and watched that movie just for them but thats it! Hate Tarantino!", "For lordofthethundercats": "Specifically wrote this for the reviewer in my title who clearly thinks because he found an average QT movie a pure masterpiece when others recognised it for what it was, a great acted movie with some very good scenes, but suckered everyone in (like him) by putting every big name in Hollywood in it and forgetting to write a worthy plot. That we are simpletons. People like you make me laugh, you watch a few films and think you know more and are better than everyone else. Get of your high horse, you clearly don't know as much as you think, you probably rate everything 10 cause even a broken clock is right twice a day.Anyway good movie. Wouldn't pay to watch at cinema. Not QTs finest hour. But great performance from Dicaprio and Pitt.", "QT's Weakest Entry, but a Well-Made Film Nonetheless": "Brad Pitt HAWT.In all seriousness though, he's very easy to look at and hands in a great performance especially leaning on his comedic chops during those final 20 min. All-in-all I enjoyed QT's love letter to the industry and a bygone era, but also, that's all it is. Its strengths are also its massive weaknesses ultimately crippling and interfering with the storyline. Editing didn't feel great either and that leaves us with a film that basks in it's polished late-60's era a bit too much and never truly delivers any statement beyond remarking on the time.I do love QT's passion for the Western. And scenes with Leo's Rick Dalton acting are some of the best scenes in the film.Also, I loved seeing some hippies get what they deserved!Potentially QT's weakest entry.", "Exclusive storytelling": "Enjoyable but history needed.\nIf your going to watch this film, I'd suggest briefly looking up Sharon Tate and the events on August 9-10 1969. I went in with little knowledge about these aspects and as a result I couldn't help but wonder what was the point in Margot Robbie's character or why do we need to know about the people next door, but after researching a little it gave the film clarity. Knowing these events will add more tension and gravitas to the feature.The actings good and the way the 60s films are shot is interesting. However, there isn't a clear plot as we just drift around the world and the pace is slow.A good film but my least favourite Tarantino picture", "I'm as real as a donut": "First off, I'd like to address that I understand why some people didn't like this movie and were pretty bored with it, I think they misunderstood it. Regardless if they were a Tarantino fan or not, this movie isn't for everyone. This is due to the fact that it's basically a love letter to 60s Hollywood and only people that know of that era's background would get who any of these characters are and what they do, if not then you'd be pretty lost on it. I also believe that most people went into this expecting this to be another crazy Tarantino movie, I was one of these people. but by the first hour I came to realize that this wasn't one of those, this is probably Tarantino's most mature film and I appreciate the standard he's set himself in and improving on his work.The acting from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio is nothing short of astonishing, the chemistry between these two is one of the best I've seen in a while. Not only them but Margot Robbie as well (although underutilized) and pretty much every other character in the movie is interesting to watch and I never felt bored when switching to any of them.The screenplay was great as always, hearing these characters interact with each other was definitely a treat and you can't help but admire how Tarantino can keep the consistency in his films with his quirky dialogue choices and make them sound so natural in them. Although I have to admit, it's one of his weaker scripts. Yes, the quirkiness is there but it's not as sharp as some of his previous films. Nevertheless, it worked all the way through.Now for the story, I can see why people say that there was no point in the whole film and that nothing really happened, and I can see that. But, I believe that this was intentional, the ultimate proof of this is that the whole film concentrates solely on it's characters and only in it's characters. Rick Dalton's (DiCaprio) struggle as a movie star as times change and the trends move on with the latest hot thing and him coming to grips with it. Cliff's (Pitt) in a bigger hole than Rick since he's basically jobless due to this ongoing rumor of him murdering his wife and getting away with it (they never confirm if this was true or not) and his struggles with that. So again, the movie concentrates a lot on it's characters and there's no real driving plot in the film. Things just happen and I'm completely fine with that, it was definitely weird at first but I got accustomed to it pretty fast and just accepted the movie for what it was as a laidback film to just sit back and enjoy it.In the end, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is an obvious love letter to 60s Hollywood and the events taken during that era while intersecting in the lives of these two men, if you don't mind a slow burn, laidback film, or if you're just a Tarantino fan then I recommend you watch it with open arms.", "Charaters carry this aimless tour of Hollywood 1969": "The film has a lot more of Tarantino in it than a lot of his other movies. It's the only film of his I would say doesn't at least slightly fall under the banner of \"action movie,\" and is focused more on character and less on violence. It also ends up feeling really aimless. There's not a straight forward plot or even a series of shorter stories, it's just things happening. There's barely any build up to the climax, it's just a thing that happened in this series of events. This is less of a movie, and more of Tarantino showing us around LA circa 1969. The shows he liked, the types of movies he loves, the places he wanted to visit, the actors he never got to meet. Which is fine as a back drop to a better story, but this a nearly three hour movie with hardly anything resembling a story. Honestly, the best parts of the movie are the extended sequences from the movies and tv shows being filmed within the movie.\nThe characters carry this movie hard. Tarantino is a great writer of characters and dialogue, and the only thing that kept engaged the whole movie was just seeing what these characters would do next. It almost manages to make up for the lack of narrative, since I did sort of enjoy seeing the random things these characters got up to.\nA big part of that is the acting. DiCaprio and Pitt have both established themselves as great actors, and they both shine in this film. DiCaprio is required to play an actor who's honestly not that great and he manages to pull off bad acting without seeming like a bad actor himself. That said, his greatest moment in the film came in one of the sequences he was filming for a show within the movie. Robbie is also very well cast as Sharron Tate, despite having a smaller role. She does resemble Tate quite a bit and she really embodies what Tarantino was going for with that character. A lot of other decent actors were cast to play various celebrities, from Steve McQueen to Bruce Lee, and got only one or two scenes. Most disappointingly, Manson, who was hyped up leading up to the movie, appears in one scene. The Manson family is a constant, but the man Charlie gets one moment that I think easily could have been cut from the film and no one would be confused.\nWithout wanting to reveal too much, I have a bit of an issue with the ending of the film. It's reminiscent of what Tarantino did in Inglorious Bastards, but infinitely less satisfying. The violence almost feels unnecessary, like Tarantino couldn't go one movie without some hard R gore. It's not the ending I wanted to see, honestly.\nI don't want to make it seem like I disliked the film. Overall the good outweighs the bad for me, and probably will revisit this movie. But for a director I love as much as Tarantino, I expect more from him. This will undoubtedly go down Tarantino's lesser known films like Jackie Brown. A good movie, yeah, but there's a reason it's not as well remembered as Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill.", "I really expected more": "The truth is one of those films that invite you to see it taking into account the quality of the actors and the producer. But let's be honest, apart from having a luxury cast and one of the best directors of all time ... the truth is that the film leaves a lot to be desired, it is very weak, there are two hours of dialogues that are summarized in a single scene that for everyone is cathartic !, we all wish that the reality had been what we saw in the end, contrary to what really happened with Sharon Tate and this is achieved with the magic of cinema, but I was really very disappointed not only in the movie but in addition to the general critics who rate it as one of the best movies of all time ... I would like to see how they would have rated it if the actors and the producer were not known ... It must be admitted that it has a very good scenery of the time and costumes but I really do not recommend it, it seemed a waste of time. It is only my opinion to judge for yourselves.", "I don't normally nip out to the toilet during movies...": "...but there was plenty of opportunity to do so in this movie due to a lack things going on.Whilst it was shot very well, there was a whole lot of nothing going on for most of the movie. That led me to boredom.Boredom of watching scene after scene of self indulgent 60's depiction. There was little in the way of dialogue and an often pointless scenarios.As others have said, it amps up towards the end of the film but there's so much wasted time in the movie. It doesn't really set the scene.At times I found myself wondering what the point in the previous scene was. As much as I love DiCaprio as an actor, I don't think he suits Tarantino characters.Pitt stole the show. Robbie was scarcely utilised.That's the last three Tarantino movies I've thought were substandard. Django Unchained was overrated, Hateful Eight I gave up with after an hour and this latest offering was a waste of a rare date with my wife.", "Waaaaaaay too long": "And not engaging enough in the least. Not only is there a lack of the quintessential trademarks of the director, but both Pitt and DiCaprio seem as though they're sleepwalking through their performances. It's a cool concept that ultimately doesn't payoff.", "Movie is too long": "The awful depiction of Bruce Lee is so despicable! It makes me lose all interest with the Director and his movies!", "Quentin Presents old recipe with spice": "Absolute Tarrentino flavoured movie. The last 15min was stunning. decaprio and bratt Pitt are delivered a flawless performance.\nA treat for Quentin fans.", "Is it really happend ?!": "I expected some kind of story or maybe a twist about anything, something. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a story about nothing. I tried really hard to see point in this cast, and i found , nothing. Al Pacino is the most useless character ever. It could be John Smith in his place, i wouldnt notice. Margot has 20 lines , maybe. I dont see a single reason why she is in this movie. This movie is perfect to watch while you sit on toilet. But not for long.", "Good music and dirty feet": "Apart from Pitt's interpretation, which is definitely the best thing in the movie, it is very hard not to think of it as just a mixture of good music and close-up dirty feet. In the end, age kicks Tarantino too.", "Slow...": "I dont like it... If I have watched it home I would stop it after 1h... To slow... Only last 15-20mins are kinda funny...", "Yup, Still Quentin": "I didn't feel the runtime on this one quite as much as I did on The Irishman, but I can see how most people find it a bit long or boring, it's one of Tarantino's slower and more reserved movies. It really is about the characters and showing their fantastical and surreal Hollywood existence. I loved pretty much everything about it's presentation except for the awkward narration, the sometimes seemingly aimless plot, and the constant and hilariously over-emphasized foot fetishism. It seriously got distracting at a few points. Overall one of the best movies by this director.", "Can't deny it's charm but there is no real substance": "I like the setting, the acting, the characters, the occasional bit of comedy all that stuff is fun but if only it was in a better structured story, this film felt disjointed and pointless, Quentin Tarantino films useless all have big finishes be it killing Hitler or Jamie Foxx messing those fellas up or whatever but the big finish while quite amusing wasn't exactly worth the 3 hours, I'd also mention the lack of screen time for Al Pacino, Kurt Russell and even Marhot Robbie really despite being the gemake lead on the poster she was probably in the film for 20 minutes or something. This movie is amusing and isn't a definite waste of time but it's kinda pointless so if your expecting a full and worthwhile story look elsewhere, Also and Brad Pitt where very very good in it tho so it gets a 6 needed more Al Pacino.", "A Really Good Film": "I think the point of Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood is that you don't need a point to tell a good story. Way too many movies are made with a focus on special effects, witty banter, and heroic fanfare, leaving the plot full of holes, corny one liners and clich\u00c3\u00a9 sentiment. Quentin Tarantino delivers as he usually does. The acting is superb, as you might expect from the cast credits, and the era seems well represented (though to be fair I wasn't alive). It is as unique and interesting as anything I've seen in recent history. While this may not be for everyone, it is a lesson in story telling from one of the masters.", "a not always gentle hommage to Sharon Tate & a former hollywood": "I did enjoy this film, despite its length, probably because I didn't expect it to be earth-shatteringly brilliant. DiCaprio & Pitt are as good as ever. It's not either's best role but they're always watchable & good company, particularly in a film which involves strolling through so much of Hollywood history.As some point out there isn't that much of a story going on with the male leads. DiCpario plays a fairly successful TV/film star whose career might or might not be about to go down the pan, while Pitt is his stunt man, driver & friend. We get to see them go about their daily lives & careers & although DiCaprio's actor has his ups & downs most of what happens is just portraiture.One notable & controversial scene involves Brad Pitt's character besting an insufferable Bruce Lee. Why Taranantino chose to show Lee in such an unflattering light is unclear, but I suspect it has to do with something close to the heart of the film, which is something akin to revisionism, Bruce Lee & at least one other 'real character' is subject to some major critical re-assessment in this film, something which with respect to the other personage, & in light of the speculative nature of that re-assessment, is done rather obliquely, presumably so as to skirt anything too overtly libellous.Though we spend most of the time in the company of Leo & Brad (a man known around town for having got away with the murder of his wife) the real heart of the film is of course about the impending catastrophe that we know is approaching in the house next door to where DiCaprio's actor lives on Cielo Drive.This foreknowledge of what must be brings a real poignancy to every scene featuring Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate, the young actress (& wife of absent director Roman Polanski) who was so brutally murdered along with former boyfriend Jay Sebring & some others on 8th August 1969.I don't want to say too much about this, except to say that in many ways the central conceit of the film in relation to this amounts to a what-if twist on the idea that maybe the killers did go to the wrong house that night.What Tarantino does with this, is, in a small way, kind of ingenious. Robbie's Sharon Tate is portrayed as an innocent, full of joy for life, revelling, in the right way, in her success, even though she isn't quite a household name. Tarantino clearly had a soft spot for his leading lady Uma Thurman, & it's hard not to imagine him feeling something similar for Margot Robbie, who, in this film, is the centre of every scene she is in, ethereally captivating in that particular sixties/seventies way. Except it might not ultimatley be Robbie who Quentin's obsessed with but the Sharon Tate herself, both her story, tragically abbreviated, but also the possibility of a kind of justice, something which strangely we witness delivered somehow in the closing sequences of the film.A part of this justice perhaps, is in a third Tarantino re-assessment, that of the murderous Manson family itself. Oddly, Charlie himself, makes but one very brief entrance. All other encounters with the family are overloaded with mockery & contempt. Margaret Qualley's youth buys her some slack, but for the rest of them, they are portrayed as fundamentally weak, cowardly, envious, & in equal measure both predatory & incompetent. There's a reckoning due in this film for such people, & with Tarantino in charge of delivering justice, one can rest assured it isn't going to be pretty.Altogether a fine return to form for Tarantino, if rather too long, but not at all surprising that's it's divided so many reviewers", "It didn't feel like a Tarantino film.": "For starters I have been a fan of Quentin's for many years, I have seen everything from Reservoir Dogs to The Hateful Eight. All of his movies (including what he wrote but didn't direct) were great for one reason or another but this film, his 9th film felt more like someone was trying to do a Quentin Tarantino inspired movie, not an actual Quentin Tarantino film. Long, drawn out scenes of dialogue, obvious \"feet\" scenes that felt forced and almost done in a joking way. Everyone who knows his movies knows theres always some scene with women's feet but this felt forced. Maybe he was forced to change scenes, edit this, edit that or even had limited time to give us what he gave us. I don't know but it just didn't feel like his work we all know.\nThe Bruce Lee controversy, I am a big fan of Bruce's and I can understand why Shannon, his daughter is so upset. While yes this is just a movie, when you are using real life people as characters in your story it would be wise to have respect (and show it) for said people, especially because they have passed on.\nAs for the movie as a whole, it just didn't move me as his other movies did. The fact that this has an 8 star review is very strange to me. I thought it was kind of boring, very little action and excitement. Too much dialogue and not enough action, every single one of his movies you can point out an epic scene with this movie though not much comes to mind except for when Brad Pitt goes up against Mike Moh as Bruce Lee (and for the wrong reasons) I feel like this was a missed opportunity. I give this 5 stars only because most of the acting was great, the imagery was wonderful and the soundtrack was brilliant. I wish I could say that I would watch this again but the only way that would happen is if theres a secret directors cut with more action and interesting scenes in it otherwise I have to pass.", "Bit too slow": "Very lethargic and slow, only positive was the picture was great and top lineup of stars from young and older. Great costumes and represented a great era and time in the US, inclusive of a beautiful selection of automobiles and memorabilia. Some scenese were exciting and funny, keeping my attention going especially at time.Very lethargic and slow, only positive was the picture was great and top lineup of stars from young and older. Great costumes and represented a great era and time in the US, inclusive of a beautiful selection of automobiles and memorabilia. Some scenese were exciting and funny, keeping my attention going especially at time.", "Day in the life": "This movie was definitely not for everyone. I really enjoy \"day in the life\" movies when they follow people whose lives I could never lead. This movie takes you to a different time and a different social class. It's a little window into the past, which was glamorous for a chosen few. I would agree that, overall, nothing happened, but I could've watched another two hours. It sort of reminded me of 'Bojack Horseman.'", "The best scenes are too short and the worst scenes are too long.": "I wanted to see more of old Hollywood and the classic timeless actors that were around at the time and the movie didn't want me to have it !!!-Bruce Lee fighting Cliff Booth is a great scene cut too short.\n-The movie is spliced with long scenes from old Rick Dalton spaghetti western.\n-The Spawn Valley Ranch scene with the horse riding hippies could have been a exciting but Tarantino thinks we want to see Cliff Booth talking with an old man for 10 minutes...You tried Quentin but it's not your best.", "Totally boring for me, unfortunately": "Di Caprio's acting, as usual, spotless. Pitt is Pitt, with his usual charisma, thank god I had the worth of my ticket when he took off his shirt. The parts about the-then-Hollywood were long and boring, I sympathised/identified/empathised with none of the characters. The whole movie was sort of a build up to the usual Tarantinesque bloodbath and then nothing. Disappointed.", "Very Good, Very Tarantino, And This Time That Made Perfect Sense": "In my review for Django Unchained I said that the ending of the movie was very Tarantino, and that that was part of the problem for that particular film. I also said, \"Tarantino got in the way of Tarantino,\" in Django, or something to that effect. I won't go into detail here about what I meant by that statement. You can go read it if you really want to know. However, I only bring that up now, because I want to say the opposite here: For Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood, Tarantino ends the film in good ol' Tarantino style! And it fits perfectly here. He most certainly did not get in his own way. About mid-way through OUATIH, I started to get the feeling that the audience was going to get a Tarantino version of a history lesson, much like they did in Inglorious Basterds (now don't get me wrong, this film is not as good as Basterds, but it is still pretty doggone good). Which is to say, not a history lesson at all. More like the version of things that many people would rather have seen play out in the pages of history. In Inglorious Basterds, Hitler receives the type of justice most of us would have preferred he received at the close of WWII. And here, the Manson clan that committed that unspeakable act of evil in August of 1969, gets their comeuppance in very Tarantino-like fashion. And that was exactly what, not only I was hoping for, but what everyone who I saw the film with was hoping for, as well. The only thing that could have made it any better, as far as I am concerned, would have been to have Manson, himself, meet the same type of fate some of his followers met at the conclusion of this film. But, that is a very small complaint in an otherwise very good movie.", "Wonderfully made, but so sterile": "Good actors, doing their best with QTs overlong and embarrassing words. Folk waiting for their lines, doing their best with a mess of a story. Many reviews are along the lines of \"it's good, you just don't get it\", like some teenager explaining to his parents the joys of modern music. We do get it: Tarantino is indulged as he did some great early work; he must be defended. Sadly, the last few movies have been indulgent and overlong, and they get steadily worse.", "6 only because it's Tarantino's": "It's too long move without any plot, if it was someone else I would give it 2-3 stars, like this gave it 6 only because it is Tarantino's movie.Expected much much more from this long movie. And especially from Tarantino who doesn't make films very often so when it does come out it should have been much better.\nI feel this was some expertiment and not the actual movie.", "Tarantinos weakest film": "I am a huge Tarantino fan. I think he is a modern Shakespeare in the cinema world. Pulp fiction is the best movie of all time for me. I freaking loved Django unchained, inglorious basterds and reservoir dogs too. I liked the kill bill movies too. So I went into this movie thinking it's going to be a classic Tarantino movie with crazy intense dialogue, some good violence and a great story written by the modern Shakespeare himself. But almost for two hours in this movie nothing major happens. I almost got bored during some scenes. If you were alive during the late sixties then this movie is a love letter to you otherwise the first two hours are hot garbage. It's not even funny don't know why it's tagged as comedy. It's lacking all the typical intense dialogues which Tarantino has in his better movies. Crazy good interactions between characters it's lacking that. Interesting scenes it's lacking that. If you have watched inglorious basterds, pulp fiction, Django unchained and reservoir dogs then you know what I'm talking about and what this movie is lacking. The typical Tarantino writing comes after two hours into the movie. The final 40 minutes were entertaining as f. That's why I gave it a 7. Otherwise for the first two hours I'll give this a 4. I was disappointed with the first two hours of the movie. It didn't feel like a Tarantino movie to me. It felt like some average director directed the first two hours. The story was boring and very slow paced. This is the weakest Tarantino movie I have ever seen. And I will never see it again. If you were alive during the late sixties then I recommend this for you, otherwise don't watch it. It's a waste of time. It's not as satisfying to watch as some other Tarantino movies.", "A massive waste of time": "I love watching quality movies, but this one ... It was the first time i had to walk out the cinema because i felt like i was gonna fall asleep. Half the people there walked out as well.", "Good, but just good": "Real action starts at 2h25m and lasts for only short four minutes. What about the rest of the movie? Well, Brad Pitt (Cliff) is stunning, Di Caprio is forgettable. I think what I enjoyed more was the beautiful friendship between the two main characters: it looks like they are always there for each other - that's a great thing.", "An extremely boring 3 hrs.": "This is trying way too hard. Tarantino is a joke and this movie was nothing more than actors being in a sub par Tarantino film. He is nothing but a pretentious snob, who doesn't know how to tell a story. Of course there is the language and the over the top violence that had become Tarantino's calling card, but that got old when I graduated from high school.", "Boring... somehow": "Surprisingly this film is both visually stunning yet entirely boring. Its lack of any plot or even meaning. Its unusual to say in the least, this film seems to be some kind of revenge flick. On top of the meandering, it contains a bizarre scene in which a titular fights Bruce Lee and wins, which has been contested on its portrayal of the mans legacy and battle with being a minority which has its merits, but this critic feels the necessity to point out that the mans legendary skill was also marred when it was well known that he was by far the most capable fighter in most of time. (If it's not obvious this fanboy feels like Bruce was far more capable than the movie let on.) Rant aside, the film carries the stunning visual and camera work that is the style of Tarantino.", "Great for KHJ, BAD for HIPPIES": "The mood and zeitgiest of LA 70's was the best. KHJ and pop rock were LA. Q.T.'s distain for hippies was perfect especially since the core of this audience were/are hippies. Brad Pitt is too good looking. My wife thinks only Paul Newman is handsomer. \u00f0\u0178\u2122\u201e\nThe cowboy scenes are way too long but everything else is so good the mid movie drag is forgiven. Leo's fatface makeup (? )is perfect, he and Pitt are really fun and Pacino is Mr. Shwars, not Schwartz, funny. Dog food scene, superb.\nI was a Capitol Records promoman in the 70's, the Tower is LA, and the soundtrack's use of minor hits support the MASSIVE PERFECTNESS of KHJ playlist and spots.\nLoved most of this film.", "You'll need a few whiskey sours to really enjoy this.": "Tarantino fell in love with a weak script here and unfortunately wasted a lot of time and talent that could have been spent elsewhere with a better story to tell.As a director, he should think about challenging himself more. This isn't a challenge, it's an homage, recreation, retread, and while technically an achievement in terms of the time period re-creation (they did a fine job of envisioning 1969, and maybe it deserves an Oscar for art direction), the storytelling takes no risks and breaks no new ground. It's simply boring in too many parts, where I found myself asking why I should care?Whether it's Tarantino-esque or not misses the point, it's simply not a \"great\" film because the script is lacking and it wouldn't matter who directed it. It drags. The narrative meanders. It's a simple film with ordinary characters. The weak script sucks the life out of it.As for the Manson murder re-imagining, it's satisfying enough, though not quite as bombastic as I expected it to be.", "Another great director that after I know him well makes a movie that may be his least best!": "I was very excited to see this movie, it has been in my watchlist since it was announced or even before, but I have to say this disappointed because rising the expectations after what was said about this film and giving it a 10/10 by the president of IMDB or whatever he is. The movie may be Tarantino's least film in my opinion. Leonardo DiCaprio is the only great thing in this movie, his excellent performance really is what made me love the movie though I don't get the story but his story is the most clear one in the movie. I really won't accept less than an Oscar nomination for him being the only living actor still did not disappoint us. I am reallly deeply in love with the scene in the trailer where he says \"Rick Fu***** Dalton\" that scene is a story by itself and may be one of the greatest scenes ever which counts for Tarantino. Brad Pitt also performed a descent performance as he always does and had a good chemistry with Leonardo. Margot Robbie's role is the strangest thing for me that It didn't need to exist at all, I didn't know what was the purpose of having here in it, it didn't make any impact thought she acts good, If you erased her from the movie nothing and I repeat nothing will change or anything gets affected by it's absence even if it was a parallel story, it didn't seem of what was represented in the movie a rich story to tell. Tarantino tried to make it have a dramatic scene of loving cine,ma but it failed for me greatly. The idea of the story is great but I say that Tarantino didn't make the best of it as we didn't see any scenes of real stunts during shooting with the presence of Leonardo and Pitt together as Pitt is his stunt double so wasn't it logic to see one scene where he is stunt doubling him! Also Brad's story had some action that lead to a grand great finale which I consider the real part of a Tarantino movie and one of the best endings ever.\nIn the end, It's a movie that has some touches of Tarantino but not all of it. 7.5/10 for Margot's unnecessary role as it has a big part of the film and the boredom at some points of Brad's story and the movie as a hole.", "buddy movie supreme": "This movie makes me smile and smile... i've watched it almost every day since it's been out. great music, the time period is captured perfectly. the chemistry between brad and leo is seamless and believable. they balanced each other out, like good friends usually do. for me it's my favourite Quinten movie. it makes me long for those days again, without the sexism though. my buddy and i wish the ending was what really happened. thanks Quinten, the Manson fight, flawless. this one belongs in my all-time favourite movies list.", "Maybe This Isn't The Way It Was - It's The Way It Should Have Been!": "This is the second \"Maybe This Isn't The Way It Was - It's The Way It Should Have Been!\" Tarantino movie creating a parallel history. The first one was the \"Inglorious\" movie.\nThe above tagline is just suggested only by the music at the film end, because that music is the main theme of an old, John Huston directed, movie: \"The life and times of Judge Roy Bean\" with Paul Newman, Anthony Perkins, Ava Gardner and many other famous actors of the '60s and '70s. That movie is about a parallel history of an outlaw who self-appoint himself as a judge to bring law in a lawless Texas town.\nThe Roy Bean movie has the above tagline: \"Maybe This Isn't The Way It Was - It's The Way It Should Have Been!\" and the Maurice Jarre composed music, Tarantino choose for his film ending.\nI'm pointing to this detail because no reviewer, public or film critic, has ever mentioned it.", "One of Tarantino's Best!": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is easily one of Tarantino's best movies. Probably his 5th best in my opinion. As a huge Tarantino fan I was really looking forward to this movie and it did not disappoint.I love for many reasons but one of them is the plot. I love the first 2/3 of the movie really much. It's slow, yes but that's what's good about. I love how we get too see all these all these recordings for the 60s westerns that they include. I like that it moves slow so that there is time to explore all the fun stuff of the 1960s Hollywood. But then of course the ending of the movie is amazing. I won't spoil it but I love how it's made. The narration from Kurt Russell, the writing and direction from Quentin Tarantino and the acting makes for one hell of an ending.Speaking of the acting. It was really good in this movie. This probably Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance in my opinion. He fits perfect for the role. And it's probably Brad Pitt's second best performance in my opinion (after Tyler Durden) He also fits really perfect for the role. I really hope they both get Oscar nominations for this. And then Al Pacino is in it (my favorite actor) and he is also really good. I wish he would've had more screen time though but I'll get to see more of him in The Irishman so it's not a huge issue. Basically everyone is good in this movie, even the dog who actually has a pretty important role.And of course there's the good writing you would expect for a Tarantino movie. He always writes amazing dialogue for his movies and this one is no exception. There's lots of quotable lines in the movie like there is in all his other movies. And for this movie he has as I said earlier written a really good ending.So basically I liked pretty much everything about this movie. It's definitely the best movie this year so far, I only imagine The Irishman can beat it. So Quentin has made another masterpiece that I can't wait to watch again when it comes out on Blue-ray and DVD.8.5/10", "Honestly a waste of time.": "I sit here afterwards, thinking about what I just watched. I cannot explain it. 161 minutes of nothing. Anyone who gives this review anything above a 2 must be a bot, there is no explanation to anything, things just happen and don't mean anything. Awful, could not recommend less. People who have it a 10 star rating should be banned from every rating movies again.", "Special Movie For Special People!": "Once Upon a time... in Hollywood is a art to drama genre, i am not a fan of long movies but this was the one that kept me engaged till the end, yes at first i needed sometime to get into the movie atmosphere until then i was leashed till the end, i think there wasn't much of story as i know there was nearly like (2 hours) of the movie event happend in one day or more in a detailed way such good backstories and all things happen fast at the last 50 minutes but you won't be lost with it, when you hear names of (Leonardo DiCaprio) and (Brad Pitt) what greatness comes to your mind as long as Leonardo was great in the lead role Brad is also the same as the supporting actor but this remains to you who you liked more i personally liked Brad more such a powerful acting from the guy, the role of (Margot Robbie) that was added was such another beautiful thing we aren't focusing on such main character there are others too to care for, one of the point that i mainly liked the movie is the calmness the way the movie expresses itself there are movies that are long,boring and you don't understand anything but this was such a simple thing, it does return us to the (1960)s where it recovers the life of that times, setup for everything thing in the movie is classic it's the movie that fits detail to it's scenes colorfull and premium feels, so our two main characters were fictional at the ending i was waiting the real event to happen but it just didn't couldn't they deliver the realistic event? even if you have two main characters i think it would be such better but here's the point it's a movie so it's ok, i couldn't believe the fact how time flew didn't feel how it finished, am sure everyone doesn't enjoy this but every movie enthusiasts surely enjoys it, highly recommended if you have patience with movies, 9/10\u2b50", "Worst Tarantino film by far.": "Worst Tarantino film by far, prepare yourself to be sorely disappointed.", "Tarantino K.O , Di Caprio K.O only Pitt on top": "A very disappointed movie of Tarantino...\nTrying to joke with some Hollywood urban legends I didn't like at all some jokes about Polanski's massacre and very disappointed the configuration of Bruce Lee like an asshole. The movie was very slow , very deep sh*** jokes and mentally k.o.

And it IS good, but only good, which is a sore let-down for anyone expecting a knockout blockbuster.\nI found the opening hour a plod-along, not boring as such but 'meh'. It definitely picked up, there were a handful of compelling scenes, notably Brad Pitt's visit to the cult compound, Leonardo's acting with the little girl, and the violent climactic scene in Leonardo's house. A film of two halves, so to speak.The unquestionable highlight for me was Leonardo's acting, absolutely superb, something I'm coming to expect every time from him. I completely disagree with the people who rave about Brad Pitt in this. For me, he was basically on auto-pilot, half the time I felt he could have just been being himself. He looked like he was having a great old time throughout, which is hardly the sign of an actor who has thrown himself into method acting the way Leonardo clearly did. It was the performance of an actor who looked way too comfortable with his life and status as a worldwide household name. He put in as much effort as Al Pacino had to, i.e hardly any.I am 40 and British so the endless Hollywood-of-old references mean virtually nothing to me. This was very much a self-indulging vanity project for Tarantino and whether he has earned the right to do what he wants or whether he has an obligation to his fans to keep providing his 'usual' type of film is up there for debate.Good film, well worth a watch, but probably just the once.", "Why is this getting perfect reviews?": "Extremely long and boring. Was really looking forward to this but it's by far Tarantino's weakest and slowest movie. Only thing that makes it a bit interesting is the tremendous acting by Dicaprio and Pitt, yet it is all in vain due to the terrible script.All the 10/10 reviews here are either forged or by blind fanboys who already know their review before they watch. In my theater, at least 5 people walked out mid-movie. Everyone else was kinda looking at each other and whispering in boredom, wondering where this movie is trying to go. Only the last 20 minutes finally got some positive reaction, claps, etc. but it was not worth the 2+ hours of lost storytelling.", "A Refreshingly New film from Tarantino!": "Yep ! Finally a new Tarantino film that doesn't centered around crime/ gangstar / revenge etc. This is a light hearted film about old Hollywood and struggle of an actor during the transition. Of course the character manson is in it but him and his crime isn't the focus of this film. They're used to deliver another message!\nThroughout the film old Hollywood and surrounding area , car , theater, people looks authentic (as they are in 60s ) . Production design is top notch. Leo and brad together holds good. Their chemistry as a actor and his stuntman is friendly, funny and overall awesome. Al Pacino is just in cameo and margo's role is extended cameo. The film never gets boring, hilarious scenes here and there , good dialogue, interesting scenes like cliff visting Manson family yard will keep u going. I don't find Bruce lee a arrogant in the film , his and cliff's interaction is funny as cliff got fired. First meeting between leo and little girl is good and the ransom scene is really well acted , quite funny.\nFinally climax is quite shocking, violent and yes hilarious too. Tag team action with cliff and his dog and finally rick with his flamethrower is cherry over top. When rick said 'I torched them ' LMFAO scene. A really feel good ending as rick and sharon got to know each other.", "Checks all the Boxes...but That's It.": "Everything you would expect from Tarantino.

Other wise, it was just ok.", "Good movie but a bit too long": "Tarantino chooses a story located in the 70's, he has a great cast who play very well (especially Di Caprio). It's only too long but I wasn't bored. The final is great, it's worthy to wait. It's a very good movie, but not the best of his production. His fans will love it, the other ones will have to think before watching it.", "Wasn't a bad \"What if?\" movie": "This is the most tamest movie Tarantino has done with his name being attached to it as writer/director. Violence overall maybe lasted a total of 10 minutes out of 160min long movie so if you're expecting more of a Django Unchained movie you'll be quite disappointed.The performances were pretty solid from both leads. DiCaprio being DiCaprio (poor guy just doesn't get enough Hollywood Awards love for what he does time and time again); Brad doing a solid job as an aging stuntman facing the end of his career as his meal tickets career looks to come to a halt.Stop reading if you don't want spoilers.Now this isn't a specific spoiler in nature as I'm not going to spoil how things turn out or what happens. But this movie is essentially a Butterfly Effect/What If movie. An alternate timeline movie if you will. The ending was not what I expected to see and was a riot.", "He is still there": "After seeing it for the last half hour, it was still the most imaginative genius Quentin we are most familiar with. He laid a gentle undertone under the heart, and no wonder he wanted to prevent spoilers. Xiao Li and Pete are very cute friends in the film, taking us like children to travel in the 1969 era of dissoluteness, disorderly etiquette, anxiety and good times. Many stalks, many beautiful feet, many old friends, great performances, and the day when we can be discussed enthusiastically, there may be a little fan threshold. Xiao Li's madness is still cute, but Pete made me regain the sensation of his junior high school.", "Once Upon a Time": "Second favorite Tarantino movie thus far (behind Django). It's more of a slice-of-life story and so there isn't a lot of action driving the plot forward, which seems to bother some people. But the slice-of-life aspect is what makes it fun to watch. Knowing what it was about beforehand made me dread the ending, but it was well worth it. This movie also had some of the best acting from Dicaprio that I can think of.", "3 stars for Margot, Brad and Leo": "I was 14 years old when I sat down to watch the release of Pulp Fiction at the cinema. It was a significant moment as Tarantino set the bar for movie excellence.Hate to say, but Once Upon a Time fell flat. I was bored. Not sure of the direction Tarantino was heading, but the first two hours had zero plot. An unnecessary two hour filler to get to a half hour climax.Disappointing, but the actors were excellent. Brad Pitt carried the movie, he personifies old Hollywood glamour.", "Confused about my opinion": "The movie is really a complex to me\nBeside the good acting and the amazing efforts of the director and the suspense of what would be next\nBut the overall of the movie was dull and disappointing because many events in the movie did not have any impact in the story flow\nBeside that I did not catch the moral of the movie or the back story that I should tho k about after I go out of the theater", "Why...": "Why did i watch this s#&@\nToo long, too boring, first time I fell asleep in a movie theater \ud83d\ude02\nDo yourself a favor and skip to the last 15 minutes or 20 minutes max", "History Re-written": "There is much to love about Tarantino's sprawling 60s tribute, the style, the flourishes, the homages and the wonderful spiky humour.It's confidence in itself propels it along and despite its lapses in what one may consider plot devices and storytelling, any more criticism aimed at it would have to be considered nit picking by any half formed cineophile.While the chaotic finale transfers it's allegiance to wish fulfillment from the Nazi enclave to the infected hippies of the era and once again registers familiar shades from a previous work, the film however is so immensely watchable that it's hard to deny the director his preferred prognosis of events.The performers are all a joy to behold and identification is solid throughout for denizens of the era, resulting in that rare example of filmmaking whereby at the end, one feels and recognises the compulsion of wanting to visit it one again in the short term.", "Great film! One of Tarantino's best. Could be shorter though.": "This film is awesome to watch it's so well filmed. Tarantino has got every detail done to the best he can for showing his version of 1969 hollywood/LA. My only thing I had to complain about is its the length. There was just some bits in the film you just thought ok was that needed, but I guess that's all the fun Tarantino makes in his films he makes an eye for detail and confrontation between characters. All in all I loved it especially the ending it had me in stitches. Reccomend to anyone to watch if you can stay with it. Top Mark's for Tarantino yet again!", "Comforting but confusing": "I find this film strangely comforting for some reason.As a background piece it's quite nice as you don't have to concentrate that much as there's no story to concentrate on. Rather it's a period piece that really does make you feel like you're in the 60s but ultimately I wonder what it's point is which makes for confusing viewing.What was the point of re-writing history? What was the point of Margot (look at me) Robbie as Sharon Tate watch the actual Sharon Tate in the cinema? All that did was remind me Margot Robbie is not Sharon Tate. What was the point of the (painfully cringe) Bruce Lee scene?All in all it's a piece of cartoon cinema that in no way reflects the 'real' world. Maybe that's its point??? That this film is as much a work of fiction as the 'history' that is presented to us??Wouldn't that be something? If that's the point then this is a darn fine piece of work.", "Disappointing Quinton": "Acting was fine, everybody played their parts well. It had the \"feeling\" of being 1969. But, for a Tarantino movie, the dialog was severely lacking in comparison with little more than a sentence being said by each character at a time. No real in depth character development that makes you connect with them. Lots of superfluous shots that while we'll done, feel more like just included to pad the run time. Worst part was probably the plot, or more like the lack of one really. In the end, not horrible, but nothing special and not what you would think of as a Tarantino movie.", "mostly long and boring": "Way to long for nothing..seems like quentin is making movies now just to indulge his foot fetish and toss it hearing his long winded dialog..jokes aside the last 10 to 15 minutes were ok. anyone that knows QT knows what to expect. mr tarantino dont be scared to edit that down to 90min, it just might improve it", "Good, not great.": "Coming off of such amazing films like Inglorious Bastards and Hateful 8, I fully expected to see QT in prime form and there were bits and pieces of the Tarantino brilliance but I would rank this work right above Jackie Brown. He is clearly a fan of the long master shot aka spaghetti westerns and we thought we got our fill with Hateful 8 but he continues this ode with Once.The production was on point with the time references and the soundtrack was like the Greek chorus and serves as a mini narrator with tone, mood, and foreshadowing. And as great as actors Brad and Leo are, they play the roles exactly as you'd expect them to. Still it was so cool to see these two finale make a film together.The ending was pure Tarantino. But if you're expecting the plot(s) of Pulp or character dynamics of Django, or the script of Inglorious, you may be disappointed.Like I said it was good and I enjoyed it. Not a 10 by any stretch. Like most of his films, they are very polarized by fans and that in itself is a sign of a great filmmaker which Tarantino absolutely is. But this particular story could have been told in 90 minutes maybe 70.", "Self indulgent tripe": "A film about nothing.... about the only good thing about this film that it's Set in the sixties and beautifully filmed . I cannot fault the acting.Just like the hateful eight QT bores us to death with meaningless dialogue and mind numbing boredom.This film was like watching paint dry .", "Not Tarantinio's best peice of work": "Really disappointed with this film, I am a complete Tarantino fan and really enjoy his films but this, apart from the last 20 to 30 minutes is terrible and just boring !", "50/50 feeling.": "It is not really a stupid film and you won't get bored because the actors are amaaaazing.\nCamera movements and angles were breathtaking. We can say the same about the soundtrack and the edit. That's what defines a QT film.BUT.... the ending made no sense compared to what the viewer gets to see during the projection. Most of the people in the room had all at the exact same time the same WTF reaction.", "For those with an attention span longer than that of a Gold fish!": "Slow burning film with an unexpected twist at the end! Would recommend.", "Very boring": "The most boring movie I watched for a while.\nNeither funny, neither interesting, zero.", "Disappointment...": "True Tarantino fan, very high expectations but it was a downright disappointment. Once upon a time .. was extremely slow paced, thin storyline, flat underdeveloped supporting characters, only a couple of those typical Tarantino dialogues, just one true climax at the end, missed the music, only for some short snibbits, all in all not worth the wait. Despite a load of brilliant actors and DiCaprio having his moments, one of Tarantino's most boring films.", "Something's missing": "First, I ll advise anyone to go see this movie not because it's good or bad but because the only way to have an opinion on a movie is to watch it. This one needs to be seen on a big screen cause there are some very nice shots!I can t really say that I didn't like it but something was missing: consistency throughout the whole movie. There are some really cool scenes in that QT but there are a lot of why-is-this-in-the-movie scenes.Acting's good, music's good, production design's brilliant, editing not so much (the opening credits: you think it's gonna be good andddd.. it's not)There is no define plot but I m fine with that as long as it's well done (The Hot Spot by Dennis Hopper). Unfortunately, this is not well done. I think I couldn't get into any of the characters and if the plot is missing, you need to feel for the characters.I love the late 60's vibes and I love to have LA in the background.So to sum up: go check that movie cause it's something interesting to see even if at the end of the day, yes, I was disappointed.", "Atypical Tarantino film but worth watching.": "Started slow but Pitt and Dicaprio's star power kept my interest. Certainly not the typical Tarantino film but a welcome change. Definitely an Oscar contender for acting and directing. Very enjoyable, a must-see!", "Really boring": "I had high expectations as I'm usually a Tarantino fan but this movie is so long and boring and has no plot the only thing that kept me from turning it off was Brad Pitt he has a few good scenes and the last fifteen minutes are great but still not enough to make up for the previous two and a half hours or so", "Booooooooooring": "I'm giving this movie 3 stars. One star for every hour. The acting was great. The sets were great. The music was great. The plot and dialogue was so slow I was crawling out of my skin. It was brutally boring. The last twenty minutes was the only entertaining part of the entire movie.", "GARBAGE!!!": "Read this carefully - Quentin Tarantino IS OVER-RATED.This movie should not have been allowed to be made. Tarantino's creative juice has run out. His last two movies were pure garbage. Unnecessarily drawn out, poorly edited, poorly written, poorly directed.I am baffled by this absolute nonsensical movie.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY WATCHING THIS TRAVESTY.The big hollywood names not attached to this movie (Pitt, DiCaprio were great, over-acting queen Margot was pathetic, the rest were so and so) made this movie just 'bearable' to watch.Tarantino should consider leaving Hollywood and making 'Bollywood' movies instead - yes - that's how bad this movie is.Such shame!!", "QT movie doesn't make it good": "Nothing happens for 2 hours, it's not a slow burn, it's a no burn, then last 20 minutes stupid random scenes that in absolutely no way save the movie and make it worthwhile.

The cast is great, it looks great, awesome time period with its style and soundtrack. Scenically, it's a love letter to vintage Hollywood.I'm a fan of Tarantino and and either like or love his movies. I admire him as a director and a storyteller. This movie has his direction... but not so much his storytelling.I never mind watching longer movies... as long as there's enough story to tell. I just didn't feel there was enough story... at least not compelling enough to fill the nearly 3 hour runtime.I still recommend the movie. But doubt I'll be revisiting this Tarantino film as much as his others.Now give us a third Kill Bill!", "Brad Pitt battles evil in this alternate reality period piece...Part Deux!": "See: Inglourious Basterds.Hype and social media seem to be driving the high ratings of this somewhat mediocre film. If you are not a Tarantino fan, catch this film on Netflix in about six months time.", "MIssed Opportunity!": "Tarantino missed a great chance to make a masterpiece with this. Instead of delving into what motivated one of the most sinister murders in history, he centers on 2 has-been losers. And to top it all off, he changed history to boot. But the world doesn't live in a fairytale, Quentin. Bumbled opportunity.", "Lots of wasted talent here": "By wasted talent I mean acting and directing. Tarantino did a wonderful job turning this worthless plot into art. Problem is...the entire story. Lots of fun build up for basically nothing, some random scene to rewrite history and really not tie into anything that happened the first 2 hours. Was beautifully shot though, some great driving scenes, fantastic production design, and some great acting.", "Tarantino at his comedic best": "Contains mild spoilers:How hilarious is this film.It's fun, it's loose, it's casual, the acting is great and the cinematography is splendid and colourful. But above all else, in terms of the script and direction, it's Tarantino at his most self indulgent as a filmmaker and I love that about this film; because Tarantino is a director who wears his passion for cinema and influences on his sleeve so yeah give me more of it. It is indeed a love letter to Hollywood and cinema as a whole, you can see that in the attention to detail Tarantino and team put into the production design to recreate Hollywood boulevard to that level of perfection all the way down to the pamphlets in the windowsills, and it's Tarantino putting on his nostalgia goggles and mining through his youth for inspiration, which makes it personal for him and I like that, you can feel the passion.\nMoreover, I also love that Tarantino chose to center his story on the day to day happenings of Hollywood movie making, the day in the life of the Hollywood actor ( a washed up, grasping at straws Hollywood actor, which adds a level of desperation, which I find interesting), the Hollywood stuntman, the casting agent, the cast and crew working on the sets. Just the kind of thing that makes a film fan like me very happy. I mean foreheavens sake the man directed a depiction of a fictional show within the film being directed(if that makes any sense) with camera movements and retakes and DiCaprio,as his character, hilariously messing up his lines. The scene just keeps going and going and holy crap did I love that, to be a fly on the wall like that I thought that was cool. Additionally, I feel this film is also kind of a love letter to cinephiles and cinemagoers as well. Particularly in the scene where Rick(Leonardo DiCaprio) and cliff(Brad Pitt) sit down together to watch Rick on t.v, the back and forth, and enthusiasm for what they love to talk about and experience together was relatable and to watch these two big stars depict something we've all done as movie fans was entertaining. Plus the friendship they have together felt very believable, you could see a story there stretching back a lot of years through the chemistry and dialogue of each interaction.Not too mention Margot Robbie's performance, which was brief granted, but I think it was admirable; I felt it was subtle and humanised, it shows Sharon Tate the human being as appose to Sharon Tate the gruesome murder victim ( not saying it would necessarily be wrong to have that but it's a change of pace and something we've not really seen before) The supporting cast was terrific: Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Margaret Qualley etc plus the Manson family storyline, which does weave in and out almost independently from the rest of the film but my God does it pay off. Culminating in a 3rd act no Tarantino fan is likely to forget anytime soon.Overall this is a time period I love( the sun drenched streets of los Angeles in 1969 a time of great transformation and hippies galore!!!),Filled with some of my absolute favorite actors and directed by my favorite director of all time what's not to love. Tarantino shows it's okay to have a bit of fun and present a contraversial time in American history through rose coloured, nostalgia lenses instead of the intense sociopolitical landscape that it was. And by choosing to exlude, or in one particular case, reinterpret certain historical events doesn't make those events less important or significant.it's Tarantino's Hollywood fairytale and it works.", "As a critic, the movie is good and as audience it is boring and waste of time and money.": "The movie is a masterpiece. The movie is so boring, that 90 % of the audience may think of walking out of the theatre and some may sleep. Yes, but the movie is masterpiece. Great great acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, and stunning looks by Margot Robbie. The movie is so slow and boring, you have collecte many references from the 70s and 80s Hollywood TV shows, so audience didn't relate it. The movie is masterpiece, but don't waste time and money to watch this movie directed by Quentin Tarantino. Eles, search on internet and watch Quentin Tarantino's movie \"Django unchained\" where D is silent and that will entertain you.As a critic, the movie is good and as audience it is boring and waste of time and money.Verdict: Nothing paisawool.", "Plot?!": "Absolutely dreadful. Slow, boring, no discernible plot to warrant 2hrs 40mins of drudgery. QT is taking the p**s isn't he?!", "Stellar cast carries movie to fantastic climax": "This movie is a slow burn, being set in fictional Los Angeles. The chemistry between the two main leads is just as good as you'd expect and their charisma and screen presence carries it for the first two hours. The last forty minutes are comedic ride. I naively thought it might follow historical events, but QT puts his own flair and it delivers. Pitt exudes a coolness that you just have to love. DiCaprio is his usual solid self. Plenty of good supporting roles add to it. Not tarintinos best work, but a fun movie. The absurdity of the final climax will have you laughing.", "Where do we go from here? My second review of OUATIH.": "My second review. Perhaps I was overly summarizing in the first one. The point is, I took it for granted that there was no necessity to say anything about the plot itself or point out which parts of other people's reviews I agree with.I agree with most of the reviews with 9 stars. A \"10\" would mean one of the greatest movies of all times, which OUATIH is not (yet).The plot:Rick Dalton is a \"has been\" B-star.\nCliff Booth is a \"has been\" shadow of a B-star.Sharon Tate is an angel with seemingly bright future. She is the next hottest thing in town (that is, after her husband).Therefore, Rick and Cliff represent the past, a wish for \"Status Quo Anthem\". Sharon represents a possible future. However, \"the hippies\" out there represent another possible future, or at least a pivot point for such to happen. Sharon is another pivot point in these temporal-spatial coordinates.As we know from history, the Manson pivot point prevailed, and we are living in a 2019 reality as it is. If, on the other hand, the other pivot point would've won (as described in the movie itself), we would, perhaps, live in a completely different 2019 - perhaps more alike to 1969?Probably not. However you look at hypothetical mind games about alternate realities (histories), there is an element of continuity, saying that the course of predetermined history will correct itself \"back in line\" despite individual interruptions, then again, some claim, that the \"pivot elements\" can really change the way the history goes, and the main problem is to pinpoint such \"pivot elements\", as for the present and for the future such is impossible, but for the past they are not distinguishable enough.Then we have some multiverse theories, saying, that the timelines split all the time into multi-realities (universes), that exist in parallel. I find the latter theory the farthest off, as we have no way of observing, recording, or moving between these universes, if they exist.The important thing in all these observances is, that it doesn't make any sense to further complicate the above concepts, as then they become even theoretically untraceable, i.e. we shouldn't use multiple \"what-if\" set-ups upon the same framework, or we run a risk of a total loss of any coherence. (Example: \"the hippies\" should not be unsuccessful and successful at the same time and Sharon should not be alive and dead at the same time, and Rick should not go down and up at the same time - if we sum up all these propositions upon the same timeline, we result in what can be called \"un-collapsed\" wave function everywhere.) But all this, I believe, is slightly beside the point.The point being, who or what are the exact pivot elements in 1969' LA, who (or what) are they directly influenced (orchestrated) by, and by which degrees of force (accuracy etc.) did this elements actually cause a deviation in the timeline from that point, meaning: did they actually de-track a predetermined timeline or not, and, of course, the same goes for alternative pivot timelines, resulting in what might have caused a totally alternate course of history.A history in which Sharon Tate would have lived and prospered.A history in which the 1960s never ended, the 1970s never happened. A history in which there would be no need for QT. And a history in which we would not watch with wonder in 2019, what \"otherworldly\" 1969 QT dares to present to us, as such world would not be as far removed from ours, as it actually is.Another thing: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood reminds me, more and more, on Mulholland Drive, not only for the obvious reasons.\nOUATIH feels, after a couple of viewings, like one of those \"lucid\" dreams, where the dreamed reality resembles the actual reality to a degree, that it is believable and undistinguishable from the latter. A dream, that has sequels, just as the waking reality does. To a degree, that while in one of either \"stories\", you are not aware of the other timeline, although, obviously only one reality seems to be the one we always return to (guaranteed), while the other timelines come and go and may have the \"next chapter\" only else-when, or even not.\nTherefore, in the same way that the two realities presented in MD converge and diverge at the same time (albeit in different movie-timeline directions), in OUATIH we have just the \"dream\" reality and no \"real\" reality, therefore we are probably invited and allowed to - just dream on...\n...which, in my opinion, really transcends anything we have seen by QT before.Thank you for your attention!", "Had to stop watching after 1 hour": "I watch movies because I want to be entertained.. this movie is just boring and a waste of time. I didn't like the movie.", "Was I supposed to like it?": "I enjoyed the first half of the movie, because usually QT's movie start as a number of seemingly unrelated stories and come together towards the end.\nThis is not the case this time.It felt like Quentin was trying too hard to be Quentin!!\nAlso when a movie like this comes out (one that's talking about actors), and the regular viewer like me is bored, they are immediately attacked, and the movie is hailed as \"not for everyone\". Remember \"birdman\", well that movie had a strory to tell at least.I hope the next movie is either something like Hateful Eight or something else altogether where Quentin tries something new instead of applying his \"style\" to a bunch of unrelated scenes and characters.", "Much Potential But Falls A Bit Flat": "I tried and tried and tried to really like this movie, but I couldn't and didn't. Save for a few moments here and there...mostly there. I'll give DiCaprio high marks, as he had the tougher job of an \"actor playing an actor\". His scenes at the end are also a must see. I'm still laughing to be honest with you. The rest of it though just kind of plodded along with no real point, leaving the viewer tired, uninterested, and bored. Grade: C-.", "So beautifully done.": "And written. This film is a true insight to what Hollywood is really about behind the scenes and the pressure of being an actor. Not many people would think making movies is so hard...", "Where is a line between tale and lie?": "In 2019, two projects told us horrific stories based on real-life, that touched me so hard. One of them tried to convey the causes and sequence of the tragedy at Chernobyl power station as closely as possible. Another showed the murders that caused the Manson Family in the most unreal way.\nIn the first case, it was necessary to bring in mass information that was criminally concealed or simply unknown to the viewer of the West. At the same time, the Hollywood murders trial turned into a whole show in the 70s. Therefore, the film's director focused on the lives of people instead of the deaths.\nIn my opinion, Quentin Tarantino is one of the most respected directors of our time, because in his films every detail makes sense, even one that may seem like a flaw at first view. Why did the movie lack dynamic? Why is the end so unrealistic?\nYou know what has to happen and waiting for it whole movie. Its creating unbelievable suspense. And a happy end, where all villains with crushed brains (and not only) and all heroes stay alive and well, it adds incredible drama. You catch yourself thinking that this is wright eng for the story in tale country Hollywood. Cuz the true world is too rude and unfair to show it on screen.\nTarantino's movies remain one of the few that can be called works of art for a wide range of viewers. You may not understand them, hate them, or do not believe in what is happening on the screen. But they do not leave you uncared and push you to the limit.", "Was a good entertaining movie": "I enjoyed this movie but the ending was a little over the top with questionable acting and screaming. Overall, good flick.", "Absolute disdain towards the audience": "This is more of a documentary for the previous generation of american cinema audience only.\nIt felt as if the director showed absolute disregard for the viewer without any kind of connected storytelling.\nScenes don't really connect with each other.

Absolutely!Did this movie had an actual plot? No...it as just a story with nothing happening.Don't get me wrong.

I love his movies and put this one on my Watchlist as soon as I saw it was coming out just because he directed it. However, throughout the majority of this film I was bored out of mind. I literally was falling asleep at multiple points. It just felt so disjointed and all over the place. When I watch movies, I tend to think to myself what I plan on rating them. During most of this film, I was thinking \"3/10\". While the ending brought it up some, it wasn't enough to save it. 90% of the film just felt useless. I really don't see how people are falling in love with it. The acting, for the most part was good, but the story was mostly garbage. I feel like Tarantino sat down to write this and purposely made it as off-the-wall as possible because he knows people will like his movies regardless. Not this time, Quentin. Hopefully, the next one will be better.", "Nearly perfect": "I love this film so much. However, I have to admit it was the last bit that made me really love it. So, to be clear..while I really enjoyed the movie, my love for it really comes mostly from excitement over the premise, rather than the content of the entire film, QT gives us the delightful gift of a re-do of that fateful night in 1969. Who could watch this and not say, \"yeah!\", or \"nice!\", or laugh out loud in glee as Cliff's dog does his stuff on the dirty rotten hippies. It just felt soooo good to watch.I would've given the movie a 10, but for Robbie's Sharon Tate. She does a lovely job acting, but she just isn't the same\n\"type\" as Tate in looks or vibe.

Pitt and DiCaprio were both great, however Margot Robbie was wasted as Sharon Tate. And then the Ending... After Inglorious Ba####ds I did not expect Tarantino to again alter the history. Whats the point to recreate an Era and ambient the movie in a specific point in History and then change it. I liked it in Inglorious Ba####ds, but to repeat it is lack of originality. I also did not like the mocking of Bruce Lee. Tarantino tried to defend himself by stating that the Brad Pitt's Character was ficticious but that does not explain Bruce Lee's depiction.", "Not for the public ?": "I understand that nostalgia gets you at some age, but keep it relatively personal. Don't make a movie out of it, because, besides real actors nobody understands what's going on, or what's the point of what's going on.

I did not.The +2 stars above junk are:\nthe very good play of the actorsthere were several actually funny scenes", "The worst 2h 41 to spend": "After hundreds movies thousand hours I spent on imdb, I created my account on imdb for the first time just to write how bad I feel after watching this movie. from start to end I'm just watching with FLAT EMOTIONS it's not a comedy, not a drama as well, nothing to wait and just waiting maybe something at some point will change telling myself its impossible to be like that with all those big names. but unfortunately it is like that and worse and I lost 2h 41m I wish no one else will lose it after my review. it's not a spoiler review, because there is nothing to spoil in this film!", "It was interesting": "There is no story. It is a group play.\nI didn't know the Sharon incident.\nIf it wasn't taken by Tarantino I will gets bored and can't be watched more than about 30 minutes, but the turns this not so interesting story into a movie so well. It may come from the actor's charm, camera work and the use of music. That said, the screenplay isn't bad at all, and it has been written deliberately to bring you interesting episodes in good timing and make you not get bored. Or if the person who knew about the incident of Sharonteat early, it would have been able to watching without getting bored by the suspense effect of what would happen at last.\nA characteristic of camera work is crane shooting. There is a scene where you go up many times with a crane and look down from above. Looking at what this means, the last part is again crane camera work. That's right. . .I felt the love of father as a human and as a senior great director of movie. I was glad that I felt it. There is also a scene where the camera stops in front of a fence. I thought that the camera will approach the fence and get over it. This camera work was a hint in advance and the effect works well in the last scene.\nIf I watch this movie again, there may be more discoveries, but this movie isn't so interesting. So it will be a few years before I will watch this movie again.\nTarantino always shoots movies with film. This is because filming is more beautiful than filming digitally. The beauty of film shoots is particularly apparent in human skin when exposed to complex natural light. The background lens blur is different. I think that anyone can understand the beauty of film if you watch carefully. Film director, take movie with film.", "Poorly scripted": "As enjoyable as any individual portion of this film may be, the very fact that we have to digest it in \"portions\" points to the ineluctable fact that it is poorly scripted.\nThe first half or so is a feast for '60s nostalgia fans, who will get some enjoyment from trying to name all the brands and trends, as well as film trivia, mixed in with enough portent in the names and settings that we all know - or think we know - what is about to happen next. Fun enough, but just as this starts to get old, it breaks off into a European foray, fast-forwarded through by an omniscient \"narrator\", though no previous or subsequent portion of the film was to use narration. Then, as if all of that had never happened, we are returned pretty much to where we left off to witness the slam-bang ending and surrealist outcome. This disjointed artifice notwithstanding, the writers and editors were still unable to keep it at less than 2 hours 40 minutes.\nThe film abounds with talent, from great acting to splendid cinematography, dazzling costumes and props; almost enough to save it. But when all this dazzle is in service to such a disjointed, rambling and uneven script, one is left wondering what about it was worth spending the last two and a half hours upon.", "You can't go wrong with a Tarantino movie.": "It's loosely based around the Charles Manson era. Great acting. Brad Pitt and DiCaprio are amazing as always. I recommend this movie.", "Most limited audience for a QT film": "I can't help but feel that this is a movie made for a certain audience. It will also, most likely, be the most limited audience for a QT film too. Ironic considering some of its themes deal with creative anxiety and acceptance. (I can't see myself watching it again, unlike so many of his others).Yes, as many have said, this is a long film. Scenes fail to build the plot let alone maintain any momentum. As a homage to the industry and era? Wonderful. The absolutely beautiful sets and whole production design is remarkable. The acting, stellar. Particularly Pitt. But for me, this is lost when the story moves at such a glacial pace. Particularly for the first hour and 30 minutes.Compare this to Django, Basterds, or Pulp and the script and dialogue are light years apart. Is this a reflection of a more assured and mature QT? I'm not sure because it does have a whiff of self indulgence too. Especially following from the gorgeous but overly long Hateful 8.I don't know, your mileage may vary, but for me it's a miss.", "worst movie ever!!!!": "I am very disappointed by my favourite actors and director. Unfortunately this was the worst movie I have ever seen . Nothing made sense, the plot, the story. one word, \"Garbage\".", "High Quality But Self Indulgent": "I've seen this film twice to make sure I absorbed the nuances and objectives of Tarantino. I overall was left feeling it's definitely one of his weaker films but still has a lot of love and quality put into it.The highlight of this film is the character development of Rick Dalton (Leo). While I'm not in that phase of my life quite yet, the theme of feeling past your prime seems very relatable for the right audience and I think the script and Leo's wonderful performance show that in a very compelling way. I didn't find Pitts character all that interesting. I know we're supposed to be intrigued by his past but I found his main utility was to highlight a very touching, loyal friendship...which was nice in of itself. I didn't grow up while Sharon Tate and Manson were in the tabloids (though I know the highlights). I will say however that knowing what happened in real life helped develop high tension throughout the first viewing with an ending that totally threw me with its twist - nice play on our expectations. My understanding is that Tarantino put a lot of effort into trying to celebrate Sharon as a human being rather than just a famous person who was killed. This is a very nice sentiment but simply made for the most boring parts of the film as we watch her listen to music, run errands, and go to the movies (snore).All in all 2h and 40 min is a big commitment to ask of the audience and he's filled runtimes like that with much more captivating stories in the past. This one becomes a bit of a chore albeit not without its pearls of quality here and there.", "It's kinda messy": "Even tho movie is pretty messy i enjoyed it very much.Movie feels like it doesn't know in which direction it wants to go. Also it doesn't feel like Tarantino movie. If i caught this on TV without any knowledge of it, i would think it was Wes Anderson movie. Except for last act of course, which is very Tarantino style. Overall not a bad movie, but not the best of Tarantino either.", "Painful": "Painful by all means. Noone would ever see this movie if it weren't famous names in it. 15mins are kinda watchable, first 2 hours felt like a documentary... a bad one. Overall it can be summed up as a lot of scenes poorly connected, plot is nowhere to be found, characters are plain with no depth whatsoever. For this amount of money for the cast they could easily make a whole documentary series about Hollywood in 60's...", "Not worthy of watching on the big screen, or at all.": "When I saw the poster for this film, I thought it looked like a heap of garbage, but I am usually a huge Quentin Tarentino fan, so when I discovered it was one of his films, I immediately booked tickets to watch it at the IMAX.That was a huge mistake. There is nothing about this film that makes it worth watching at the cinema, let alone at the IMAX. I regret wasting my money on this movie, it was the biggest disappointment ever, and the worst Quentin Tarentino movie ever made.The story is all over the show, and extremely boring. I almost walked out of the cinema, but the 5 minutes at the end of the movie are the only part of the movie worth watching, so you may as well fast forward to the end and skip all the boring bits up until then.This is supposedly the 2nd last film he is making, and I won't be watching the last one, if this is the type of garbage he is unleashing on his fans.I would give this film zero stars because that's what it actually deserves, but unfortunately, I am forced to give it a 1 star minimum. I am not sure why it has a rating of over 8 out of 10 because it certainly doesn't deserve it.", "Close to leave the cinema": "I am big fan of QT movies, but this one was tought to watch. Half of the movie they just drive in a car, and the other half hardless anything happen. I understand that it is connected to true events, but this per se does not make a movie good. In shord words: boring movie that does not deserve all the buzz around. Never happened before, but we were quite close to leave the cinema several times...", "WTF is this?": "I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around why anyone would like this movie. The style? That's pretty much all it had going for it. Nothing happens! It is very boring until the violent end.\nWhat floors me is that people think this end is funny and awesome. How is 2 old white men shown violenting beating and killing 2 underage girls ever funny in any circumstance? I get they were trying to kill him in the movie but you still shouldn't enjoy 2 grown old white men violenting beating and killing underage girls seen on screen. I say underage because Cliff asks one of the girls her age and confirms she is under 18.\nAnd don't even get me started on the racist Bruce Lee treatment. I actually bawled my eyes out hours later when I processed what just happened in that scene. I am not a sensitive snowflake and I do not play the race card ever! But to revert him to racial stereotype just to bring the white man up? Even Polanski a convicted child rapist was treated with more respect.\nI feel like Tarantino's true colors came out. He's old hollywood, racist, pedophile.", "Lacking a strong story": "Ok, so I'm not a Tarantino fan. The guy loves film, and loves references to film and to 20th Century pop culture. So, the film meanders around for 2hrs, with lots of extended scenes of people driving too fast to parties or home in tiny stylish open top cars. It seems like most of the scenes were irrelevant to any story line but were a self-indulgent delve in to some semi-historic events so that Tarentino could reminisce. The final ten minutes were a twist on an actual event in Holywood, and was probably the nub of an otherwise plotline free film. Had Bad Pitt and Leonardo de Caprio not been the stars, it would have been an exceptionally dull film. However, this film showed they both have an amazing screen presence with Brad literally being engrossing even when he's just opening a can of dog food.The question is, was it a film? If I had been editing it, it would probably be 20 minutes long, the rest contributes nothing to the story. Thus, it's more like an extended mockumentary on 60s Hollywood but with no real thread.", "Boring slow paced": "I wasn't entertained nor really enjoyed this movie, found it really dragged and was mostly 2 hours of just references to the movies of the 50's and 60's. No real story even the humour fell flat.", "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood - Revisited": "When I first watched this movie, my biggest problem with it was that the plot was meandering, but watching it a second time with the plot structure in mind, I had a lot more fun with it. The main thing I like about this movie is the atmosphere. Tarantino truly transports you back to 1960's Hollywood and its a world that I couldn't get enough of while watching it. Also, Dicaprio and Pitt put on great performances and their chemistry with each other is breathtaking. It took me a re-watch, but I really like this movie.", "TARANTINO IS TALENTED BUT OVERRATED": "I respect Quentin's work very much. I really do. His legacy in modern culture is virtually unparalleled, as much of modern cinema could be considered 'post-Pulp-fiction'. I consider him the Hitchcock off our times (in talent, not similarity of style).\nBut being a fan doesn't necessitate adoring everything he's does; and frankly I find his 're-takes' on history somewhat wearing. I understand he likes to genre band, and kudos for trying something different. But there are a few things in OUATIH that irked me. Without going into details and spoiling it I'll just say a martial arts legend gets poorly treated in order to flesh out Brad Pitt's character, as well as the obviously huge retake on a certain event that happened in L.As Cielo Drive - and is the basis for the notion that the 60s lost it's \"innocence\"... or does it? Well it would be if it happened slightly differently to how we see it. And thus is my issue.\nAnd I guess what frustrates me is I don't know why he does it. But I guess maybe that's just him, that's just what he does. It's not my cup of tea, per se.\nIt's also nearly four hours long. Not necessarily that it feels it to a fault.\nI will say it's a fun romp notwithstanding So suspend your inner critic (if you can) and enjoy a fabulously acted 'period piece'.\nDiCaprio is OUTSTANDING.\nQTE", "terribly long": "I waste of time. Dicaprio played his role very well and so did Brad Pitt. there were some funny scenes in it but all in all it is way too long and not much happens in all the time. I loved the dog scenes though, for that I am glad that I eventually watched it but otherwise it is not worth it. The 'story' is told in almost 3 hours and there are about 2 suspenseful scenes in it. The main part is the last 10 or 15 minutes and that's it.", "On the fence with this one, im going to view it again but it was definately good.!": "The haunting of sharon tate a movie which i recently watched on netflix has ruined the viewing of this quentin tarantino version, im a big fan of quentin i think his films are excellent - every scene is watchable in all of his films , hes a brilliant director and writer with a wicked imagination , he makes art understandable in a movie sense , ive enjoyed watching his movies over the years , and hes the kind of guy i would hang out with , this adaption related to the manson family murders is an excellent concept of mixing his fictional characters with real life characters which works for me and its a new genre which should be explored .....leanardo di caprio plays rick dalton an aspiring but failing actor in the 60s who has a pally relationship with his stunt man cliff (brad pitt ) who seems to be more dangerous than his job title ; di caprio plays the conflicted actor who is trying to further his career whilst cliff the stuntman is happy been daltons stuntman , double and friend , whilst the two characters eek thier way through thier career they become heroes and alter history in the movie time continium which is original , .di caprio uses his usual talent as the failing actor who has his buddy cliff to fall back on , brad pitt as cliff is one of the coolest characters in movie history he has alledgedly killed his wife and got away with it.... he insults BRUCE LEE behind the scenes and beats him up lol priceless , an excellent take on the movie industry and genre conflicting episode \ud83d\udc4d", "I didn't get it": "Classic Tarantino with the classic soundtrack and beautiful and unique cinematography but it felt like Reservoir Dogs where the whole movie was slow build up the last few minutes and you're left with \"what was the point of that?\". It was very slow throughout almost the whole movie which I didn't mind as I enjoyed what how every detail of what's being done is shown and especially heard. They're pouring a cup of coffee? You'll hear them slurping it...alot, but there were many scenes that didn't seem necessary. I suppose it's to give more personality to each character going farther in depth in their lives but I don't see how it added to the story. It just seemed like an attempt to get you more attached to them. It was definitely entertaining but didn't feel special to me.", "My cut": "The movie is too long, with unnecessary scenes that add nothing to the story. Accidentally is nearly all the scenes where Di Caprio is on stage without Pitt plus the one where Robbie goes to the movies. So what I have done? I made my own cut editing all that fluff, it was 39 minutes of boredom, on a dvd. Tarantino obviously has only yes men around and that is not good for him. Let's have a party with my version and icy beers.", "Good cast, Poor story. Hit and miss.": "Two completely separate stories that don't make sense in the same movie. One of the two stories is very interesting. I wish the movie was just about that. I really hate movies about show business. Sorry guys, show business is dead boring.Anyway, love the cast. Some good directing, but the story is all over the place and for the most part, very boring.", "Like looking through a glass pane into the 60s.": "What a film.This film managed to meticulously bring to life many fantastic characters, two of those being Rick Dalton ( Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt).Both of these characters were amazing to just watch and observe their lives and both actors played their roles to absolute perfection.My favourite character to watch was probably Cliff Booth as he was just so fun and even in the eerie situation of the Hollywood Cult, he still manages to be a sort of badass funny guy.Leo was also absolutely amazing as Rick Dalton, the scenes where he was on set playing Caleb DeCoteau, genuinely made my eyes tear up when the little girl was speaking to him about his novel and he started to break down. Fantastic acting from both of them in that scene!This is also my first Tarantino Film that I've watched and I loved it! I noted the excessive amount of people not wearing shoes though.Margot Robbie wasn't in this film as much as the promotion would lead you to believe but when she was, she was really great. She captured Sharon's friendly essence perfectly and it was beautiful.I loved this film all throughout because it was a great window into the era of the 60s and the lives of the people who lived it, and were involved in Hollywood during that time, which I find particularly interesting! But as much as I loved the film, I couldn't watch during some of the final scenes, because I was wondering how it would play out since I already know the real tragedy that occurred in August on 69', but this film took the real events and spun them on its head, crafting a very vicious and hostile yet satisfactory scene where the Cult Members get hell delivered to them.The cult members were also creepy all throughout their screen time, putting me on edge and even at the end making me cover the screen and turn my volume down because the tension was too much, Austin Butler was the standout as Tex, he was just so unsettling, he's becoming a real star recently and I'm glad!It was also really cool to see Bruce Lee show up in a couple of scenes! That built the immersion of the time period some more!That final scene with Rick going up to meet Jay Sebring and Sharon Tate also made me teary eyed after knowing what happened in reality. What an ending.Overall I loved this film and thought that every actor in it played their roles to perfection (including Brandy!) and I can't wait to rewatch it! This also makes me excited to see more from Tarantino!10/10!", "An absolute disappointment": "Admitting that I was unfamiliair with the Charles Manson madness I did do my research after seeing this film.\nIt made a lot more sense once I knew what this story is based upon.But, truth be told, this movie is just plain boring.\nThere was absolutely no need for this movie to be as long as it is. There are so many unnecessary scenes that dragged on forever.It is proven once more that Tarantino can't rely on his celebrated dialogues all the time because some of them are way too long and way too meaningless.This movie truely lacks a good story. The actors can't be blamed for the failing of this film. They all did a great job. Margot Robbie's character of Sharon Tate was very boring to watch. Her presence added nothing and every scene with her felt like another stretch to make the movie last even longer. Brad and Leo are a golden combination and perform like one can expect from these professionals.Unfortunately, the movie needs to rely on unnecessary voilence like most of Tarantino's films. It was hard for me to watch, and to hear how much people seem to enjoy this type op filmmaking.\nTo me it seems like we are dealing with a one trick pony, not with a director with his own 'style'.I have not heard one person say they actually thought this is a good movie. On the contrary, this movie is breaking records everywhere on how many people are walking out of the theatre before it is even finished.", "Do not watch": "Very bad movie. Please do not watch it, save the time and your nerves for something useful.", "Disrespectful": "So boring, so long, nothing happens really, but most importantly how dare of Tarantino to make fun of Bruce Lee. Those sounds Brad made so disrespectful to such a legend and icon. He'd be kicking all your asses if he were still alive today. He never fought like that, didn't make those noises and never had that character.

In Hollywood: Episodic Tarantino Film Has Laughs, Gory Ending": "3 out of 5 stars (average)Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood is the newest film from Quentin Tarantino, and it's unlike any of his others. He isn't exploring any deep themes, giving us nuanced characters, or making a statement about old Hollywood. With this film Tarantino has gotten many of his previous collaborators together for a fun, episodic romp about the day-to-day lives of Hollywood hopefuls, with mostly enjoyable results. Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood is no classic, but fun performances, good writing, and a wild ending make it worth seeing at least once for Tarantino fans.We follow washed-up TV actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), his pervy stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt having the time of his life), and Rick's next-door neighbor and actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Rick and Cliff are both seeking further status in 1969 Hollywood, and Sharon is a rising star living life to the fullest. All 3 will experience the highs and lows of the Hollywood life while trying to advance their careers.Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood is less a movie than a series of connected episodes featuring its characters. While I typically dislike these kinds of films, enough of the scenes hit their mark thanks to Tarantino's writing and direction of his actors that I enjoyed myself. DiCaprio, Robbie, and especially Pitt are all having a blast here, with the latter giving one of his most entertaining performances in years. The film also subverts expectations effortlessly and gives one of 2019's nuttiest (and bloodiest) climaxes. Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood won't rank among Tarantino's greats, but it's still fun viewing. See it if you like his stuff.", "DONT SEE IT EVEN IF SOMEONE PAYS YOU - one of the worst movies i saw in a while": "Apart from the acting this movie really sucks.\nboaring as hell, i cant belive that it is made by Tarantino", "Trantino's last movie seems much more inspired by Fellini than Leone.": "Despite the title, for most of the time this movie feels and looks more inspired by a Fellini's movie then a Sergio Leone's one. Anyway, It just misses some epic dialogues to be the best Tarantino's movie till now.", "ok": "Probably a movie with extremely high knowledge reserve requirements for fans, it is indeed comparable to the ultimate battle in the sense of the history of pan-film. The test preparation is not as good as mine. It is also hearty to watch the last 30 minutes. If the front stalk is unreachable, it may cause a lot of urine spots, and intuitively Bruce Lee 's passage may be risky in the mainland.", "A good Director made a boring film": "This film shows how a good metteur en sc\u00e8ne can still make a bad film, boring, not worth it.", "Are you kidding me !!": "What a disappointment it was , if it's not for the big names no one would even say a word about this very very boring ordinary blot ...WTH !!", "Is like wow, this is what you guys get to do for kicks": "Seriously, I get it... ya'll can and should have fun... what a blast", "A turn for Tarantino": "Mostly: an actor achieves stardom playing a cowboy on TV. After that show ends, his career begins to decline, and he knows it. Can he rekindle his career or come to terms with his new reality?The TV star's best friend and stunt double is in much the same professional boat, but he is a very different person with a different life, and doesn't suffer from the same angst at the boat taking on water.Tertiarily: a group of hippies one of whom has a crush on the stunt man. That relationship goes very sour after he learns the hippies are squatting on the land of his former colleague and one of them knifes the lead's car's tire.I call this a turn for Tarantino because it's very different from his other films. Most of his stories center on violent criminality and this one is more of a typical character drama. It feels disjointed, though, as the hippie storyline seems to have basically nothing to do with the main story; it's like Tarantino felt a need to inject a fight scene into it, and they exist to make that happen. Similarly, I didn't understand all the screen time given to the neighbors, who also had nothing to do with the central idea and had little interest of their own. The disparate storylines converging at the end reminds me of Pulp Fiction, but this isn't that well done.Overall, this was only somewhat satisfying to me. I enjoyed the parts where DiCaprio's character struggled with his position and his habits and I enjoyed Brad Pitt beating up hippies. But those pieces don't work well together and most of the movie is neither of them; much of the rest that was shown had little appeal I could discern besides '60s nostalgia.", "Boooooring!!!": "I've seen things like this movie before - wait! I did! In hundereds of documentaries about this time and event. Tarrantino is a hack, pure and simple! No tallent, no vision, no understanding of real people. Just taking videos of friends and neighbors. What a loser.", "The worst Tarantino movie ever": "As a Tarantino fan I feel cheated and disappointed. Apart from the climate of the 1960s and 1970s, the film brings nothing at all. It's fatal and boring. Watching it you only lose time and money.", "Far from the reported magun opus, but still one of the best": "Just to be clear, I am a huge fan of Tarantino. I have seen every movie his made and found enjoyment in every one. None since Pulp Fiction have ever come close, although, this film definitely makes the top five. It's absolutely not his worse as that could easily be From Dusk Till Dawn although there is quite a bit of enjoyment in even that.\nI'm reviewing this on a second viewing because, like many other big Tarantino fans, I didn't like it so much when I saw the movie in the theater. At first viewing it can be disappointing for people of my same disposition. It's quite different than the usual Tarantino universe. I was already wary when first seeing this because it was the first movie I had seen by Tarantino to be listed dominantly in the comedy genre. Coming into this thinking that you will get the usual ultra violent crime thriller that the sadistic fans have come to guiltily enjoy, you will be disappointed. But, the as well \"usual\" humour and dark wit that often persperates from the Tarantino works is simply heightened to dominance. On either a second viewing or the preposition that this is different than what you are used to, this film shines in a whole new light.\nThe movie is heart-felt and extremely funny. Even laugh out loud sometimes. If you can get over not seeing the Tarantino film that you're used to, this is definitely worth the watch. Plus, without giving too much away, if you were a fan of the Inglorious Bastards style of rewriting history than you will greatly enjoy the ending. It may even be the best part of the movie, which is a ringing endorsement in that the end of a story is often the hardest to get right. Truly satisfying.\nThis is a movie for the devote cinephile primarily, but it is also for anyone that is used to Tarantino or may want a fresh take from the renowned director.\nThe only reason I can take one star off and give it a 9/10 is that it does miss the usual astounding writing that made me fall in love with Tarantino films in the first place. It is no philosophical pulp fiction and no subtly poetic Inglorious bastards. But, without preconceptions, it is still a fantastic film.", "Film review": "The film begins with the usual style of Quentin Tarantino, telling you that this is a fairy tale full of fiction, fantasies, fun and moral; you can carefully analyze and delve into every detail in the film. Where does the prototype concept of each plot come from? you can also drop everything and listen to a madman who is passionate about the film, telling what kind of crazy story, and simply enjoy it in his works.", "Classic Quentin": "Exactly what it says on the tin....or at the top of the cover in this case. What we've come to know and love from Tarantino films....the acting is immense and the ability to twist fact with fiction in the storyline is transitionally smooth and unexpected. You know it's coming....but you never know where or when. Must watch!", "Where is the story?": "This movie was beautifully filmed. The production design, cinematography and attention to period detail are all top notch. The cast all played their parts well. Nothing seemed forced. I believed I all of the characters.Where this movie fell apart was the story...or more accurately the lack of story. There isn't much character development. This is somewhat understandable as the movie really just takes place over two short time periods that are six months apart. I was waiting for something to better tie the plot together between the Sharon Tate / Charles Manson group and the DiCaprio / Pitt group. It didn't really happen until after the climax. Even that felt forced for the sake of the movie. The \"big action scene\" at the end was good. Unfortunately there was no story that led up to the climax. It was just there.Maybe I'm missing something because I'm not a Tarantino fan. I like some of his movies and dislike others. I gave this film a chance. Sadly, it just didn't deliver.", "A beautiful odd to Hollywood": "This film is Quentin Tarantino showing us how much he knows about film history. In general it's really good, the cinematography is outstanding the retro nostalgia and the acting are the main attraction here, especially Leo and Brad pitt who gave a very memorable interpretations and the last part of the film is typical Tarantino carnage. However it felt like it lacked a stream and a story it was spinless, even if the overall build up is something to admire it didn't go anywhere special in term of story telling. But that didn't bother me particulary because I was able to enjoy every other great thing in this movie from the beautifully Filmed and curated sections and scenes to the perfect soundtrack.", "Well shot movie but the plot is just awfull": "I think that Tarantino wanted to do something similar to the European movies but wait his American and deep thoughts expressing emotions it's not his best. Don't get me wrong the guy is a genius but the film is just about the boring life and problems of actors of the late 60s and nothing more.\nIf you like that is ok if not then don't watch it.", "Best 2hr and 45min in my life!": "This movie is very good, not only does this move have great acting, but it also keeps you at the edge of your seat and it makes you laugh a lot. I highly recommend this movie if you want to watch a good long movie.", "Definitely the Worst movie of the year!": "Totally useless, no story, weak scenario, total disaster. I used to like Tarantino...", "Wasted 3 Hours...": "Hello ThereI will review another aspect of the movie in each paragraph.I don't even know where to begin reviewing this movie but it is full of flaws. Like cmon I am not expecting it to be flawless but this is way too much. Everything except the world building, choice of songs and acting is terrible in this movie. And none of these are enough to carry the movie on their own when rest of the stuff is absolutely terrible.Tarantino just tried to show how much he knows about the 60's Hollywood in this movie and because of his brag, there is no storyline. Movie is just like 60's Hollywood this, 60's Hollywood that... And it goes on.As the man himself says a good movie should make you wanna go sit down, get yourself a slice of pie and talk about it. But when I was out from this movie, I didn't want to say a single word about it because it was obvious that it was really bad but all I wanted was to tell my friends to not waste their 3 hours with this.Movie's plot end in the first 15 minutes and rest of the movie is just random events that have absolutely no connection between each other. This is what it says on IMDB page: ''A faded television actor and his stunt double strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry during the final years of Hollywood's Golden Age in 1969 Los Angeles.'' and it is a big lie.Then lets get to our characters. To me, Brad's character was the only tolerable character is the whole movie. Caprio's character's personality changes drastically over time but when it is about to take the sharpest turn we just get a ''6 Months Later'' and boom, over a narration his character is a whole new person now.. Don't get me started on Sharon Tate, her whole arc was about the last 20 words she said at the end of the movie which took like a minute and yes that is her whole arc.I thought this movie was going to be about Manson murders but then no again. Movie has nothing to do with that. Nothing in the movie leads up to the murders and then it just comes out of nowhere. I know that the nothing in real life led up to the Manson murders but if you put that in your movie, you need to set a backstory for it otherwise it just makes no sense.Ending was great (still not enough to make you sit down and go through this movie just for the ending) but it was predictable. Because that is just what Tarantino does. He takes inspiration from real life events then changes them and makes is satisfying for the audience. It was obvious that none of our guys were gonna die and it was going to be murderers who dies at the end of the day.Some people think that Tarantino just created a new genre of movies with this but soon they will understand it. That kind of people think something is very genius and smart when they see it for the first time but when they see it for second time they just realize it was just a stupid attempt.And I might call this movie a ''Modernized'' Pulp Fiction considering this movie tells you multiple events but this time these events has nothing to do between them and they are completely irrelevant and another difference is that we don't get different characters in these events.Lastly I don't even know how this movie got a 10 minute standing ovation at that film festival and I had went to the Hollywood with this exact same script, they would reject it instantly and laugh at me.", "No one under the age of 50 will understand this movie": "Quinton latest film is finally hear! His movie is a fairy tale about Hollywood, presumably set in the 1800's because everything is so old and boring. Billy Beane from \"Moneyball\" stars as stunt guy James. I think Duke Boom Boom from Pixars latest film \"Toy's Alive 4\" was a much better stuntman. And, he was playes by Keeanu Reeves. Leo returns to the silver screen in his very first role since Titanic! Now, Leonard is older with a big beard and disgusting dad bod.Unfortunately, I'm a bratty 16 year old and do not understand the constant references made towards old timey hollywood. I would have much preferred the film to be set in the modern year, and maybe make Billy Bean the stunt man for Avengers or something idk.My suggestion is to go watch spiderman, unless you are an old dork. Spiderman has more webs, and explosions which makes it a superior film.-Rusty", "A braid of fantasy and reality": "What's real and what seems real are the real topics of this film. Please make note of the stunning Julia Butters when you say \"up and coming\". Just imagine being HER age, acting with DiCaprio and being directed by Tarentino and doing it as naturally as breathing!Ditto to all the other positive reviewers, raspberries to the older ladies next to me who kept stumbling out of the theatre grumbling \"That's not what happened to Sharon Tate\", and perhaps one critique, it does ramble in some areas with especially long driving scenes.", "B.O.R.I.N.G.": "Succcchhhh a waste of time. 2 hours and 30 minutes of complete nothing for 11 minutes (MAX) of action. My god. Don't waste your time.", "A class act": "It's covered the 60s, the 70s, the 80s and to a great extend the 90s... A classic masterpiece for a viewer who's lived all of the modern era and knows how it was back in the days... Never loved Brad more than in this ever.", "Such a disappointment.": "I waited 1 year and a half for this movie to come out once it was announced, I had the highest expectations hearing it was gonna be quintins 9th film and he had the likes of Leo and brad Pitt on the cast, this movie was a major let down 1 hour and 30 minutes into the movie and nothing happens, the storyline just isn't there it's no we're to be found they had so much potential with cliff booth and rick dalton but they just stayed as wash up bestfriends trying to figure out life, the scenes with Margot Robbie almost gave me an anxiety attack she had like 30 minutes of screen time and 25 of it was at the theater with her just watching herself, I know what some of you people are saying \"it's a love letter to 1969 she's so amazed to see herself on the big screen\" yea yea I get it but so far I just explained 2 hours of the movie and nothing happened the movie some what picks up towards the end but it was still flat. Nothing exciting nothing crazy just plain out flat, I was really thinking about walking out the movie but then there lucky the Manson murders finnaly showed up, the cinematography and the music and the acting and the directing and showing us all a visual picture of how the 1960s was in normal life with cliff booth and in the cinema life with Rick dalton was cool I admit it was cool. But this movie does not deserve the reviews for \"10 out of 10 and quintins best movie\" it's just extremely disappointing as a quintin Tarantino fan I really wish I can say this is one of his best films but it's on the other end, I really do hope someone sees this review and chooses not to believe the 10 out of 10 reviews like the mistake I made before going to see it", "Good Movie": "The movie was definitely a 10/10 and I liked it a lot. Leonardo DiCaprio did a really good job and so did Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt deserved to win the Oscar he won for his performance. I enjoyed the movie a lot and one of my favorite parts were whenever the hippies were trying to attack Brad Pitt's character and Brad Pitt tortured them and so did Leo.", "Please do not waste your time on this!": "Pointless movie, no plot at all. I mean what the heck?", "Painstakingly attentive to period detail and pretty light on an actual plot.": "Quentin Tarantino's tribute to classical Hollywood's twilight years looks great, the acting is pretty strong, and the sixties setting is commendable.Except there's really not much going on in the actual movie. The closest thing to a character arc is Leonardo DiCaprio's character Rick Dalton coming to terms with his best years of his acting career behind him. His faithful stunt double and confidant Cliff Booth (a stoic steely Brad Pitt) provides Dalton with friendship and a chauffeur. Meanwhile, his new neighbors moved in. Their names are Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Yeah, you can guess who else shows up later.DiCaprio and Pitt's performances do help make the film's ponderous length more tolerable. The pair are different sides of the same coin when it comes with careers. DiCaprio's insecurity is constantly on his mind whilst Pitt seems to have acheived an inner zen.", "To much length for so little...": "The expectations were high because after all it was a Tarantino movie.\nIt isn't a bad movie, its just that i was expecting a lot more. After an hour i started to wonder what was the story all about. It's just an ordinary story of an actor with a gore ending... and that's all folks.\nIf you are expecting something like Kill Bill, Inglorious Bastards, Django, Hatefull eight,,, this is not your movie. For me it\u00c2\u00abs the worst movie Tarantino ever made, theres something missing...", "Batmaaaaan, oooooo Batman.": "This story is not about Sharon Tate. This is the story of Rick Dalton. Rick Dalton is the image of classic Hollywood. Excellent shows 1969. I'm used to seeing a bloody movie from Quentin. This film is soft and 1960s style. The film is full of references and Easter eggs. Scenes of August 8, 1969 I was shocked. I did not expect such a turn!", "Boring & Plotless": "Watch the first 15-20 minutes, leave for dinner, come back for last 30 minutes (yes, it's that long and horrible).

Where is the rest of this movie??": "I was so hyped this movie. The story, actors,70's theme and of course the director Quentin Tarantino in a tarantino movie, sometimes story move on so slow, characters, they stories introduces the audience and most important it has a Breaking Point. I wait wait and wait.. For what? 25 minutes cheap fight. Total disappointing for me.. And may I ask what is the main idea of this film? I understood that if this is a 70s documentary instead of a tarantino movie. Perhaps I missed something IDN but all I know is this movie a huge waste of time. I gave 6 because in my opinion best thing in the movie is Brad Pitt. Thanks for read.", "Thoroughly satisfying": "A great mixture of truth and fiction. Knowing the real events and characters makes this film really enjoyable. The ending is the most touching rewriting of history you might ever see on film, and though you know it's fantasy, you are left with a thoroughly satisfying feeling.", "Good acting, not much more than that": "This was all Quinten Tarantino's fault. Leo and Brad did an amazing job in their roles. Great acting. But this movie lacked depth, it lacked story line and I felt like I was waiting 2 hours just to see something actually entertaining. Hard to believe Tarantino spent 5 years on this. I'm sorry to the all star cast that will be brought down from mediocre screen writing.", "How Re-write 1969. Genius": "This movie can be boiled down to one scene. Burning up in someone else's swimming pool because you're too stupid to go underwater and put yourself out. This is genius film making. And in the end...", "Ok Boomer!": "Once upon a time in Hollywood (2019)\nScreenplay and Director: Quentin TarantinoIt is funny that every young generation feels that they have been taken for a ride by the generation before them and that there is a dire need to put things in order. Invariably, they all fail miserably. Look at the timeline at which this film is based. It is the late 1960s. The world is in chaos, yet again. After getting the world crippled with two world wars, the baby boomers got the world upon its feet again. But that was not to last. Within a decade, the world nestled back into two camps yet - the 'good' and the 'bad', and the whole imbroglio of violence and killing is to repeat. The youngsters see this as the failure on the part of the adults to set a just world. They venture into the realm of the unknown to set into motion a new world order.Just like Greta Thunberg and the angry kids around the world in the 21st century, the 60s had their share of anti-establishment. The anti-Vietnam demonstrator, the hippie culture and the flower power movement are examples of the above. Unfortunately, they chose many self-destructive avenues to mull their pain of an unknown future. A group of them built a commune in the middle of the Navajo desert with an ambitious plan to plant crops. The plan failed miserably, and they end up having free sex, booze, illegitimate children, drugs and crimes under their belt to support their sustenance. Their dreams of living in a free world never saw fruition. They ended up in the same world that they abhor, of subjugation, control, dominance by one party and victimisation. The ladies thought they were liberated by burning bras. They felt they attained women empowerment through contraception. They got neither. They found themselves getting unknown diseases, unshakeable baggage and answering to the dominant force they were trying to shake off.We are angry, and it is your fault!It must be the curse of mankind. They are forever trying to find the best way to find peace with themselves and their surroundings. They have trying multiple economic modules with the same disastrous results. Trickle-down economics, fountain effect using the market forces or a utopian leftist agenda, it gives the same answer -disappointment.Coming of age around the mid-70s and early 80s, we are all too familiar reading of Marilyn Manson and his occult cult. The tabloids kept us informed of the pretty Natalie Wood and the mystery surrounding her yacht accident and the gruesome murder of a gravid Sharon Tate in her exclusive Hollywood home.Not knowing what to expect but deciding to watch it anyway after finding out that it is a Tarantino movie, I was wondering what the movie was all about. At first it about the story of a struggling actor and his stunt double. Then it moved on to 1969 Hollywood, the commune of hippies, Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski and the murders towards the very late part of the show.The author took the liberty to give a totally different twist to the course of history as we know it. The three members of the Manson cult/family end up having a duel with the actor and his stunt, as well as dying in their hands. Tate is nowhere nears the assassins. In fact, at the end of the movie, she calls her neighbours over for drinks.Maybe Tarantino is hoping for an alternate universe where Tate becomes a big star, and the world would come together and sing Kumbayah!", "A trippy daydream": "A brilliant portrayal of another era that feels like an authentic daydream to me and probably anyone else who was around back then. It burns in moments and drifts like a river the rest of the time. If you could take the best moments of a time in your history and then spin it around to a way that could make it better, you might be able to do what Tarantino's done here. It's a trip alright.", "A tarantino film for non tarantino fans": "If you're not a HUGE fan of tarantino like all the people who are writing these reviews, I can nearly guarantee that this is more than just watchable. This movie has fed into the hopes of tarantino fans (such as myself), but kept the storyline in such a way that you dont have to be fiending for excessive violence like the rest of us. The acting is GREAT, The comedy is hilarious and it puts a very happy spin on an otherwise, really dark topic. MUAH, TARANTINO, MUAH. Im impressed.", "Surely this isn't Tarantino": "I understand what this movie is about but just because it's obtuse doesn't mean it's good. It suffers horrendously from pacing issues. No clever, witty dialogue, which is Tarantino's stock in trade. I don't like Brad, which doesn't help, but how the hell he won an academy award for this defies logic.. a pity Pitt award? Watched it on Amazon Prime and ended up cleaning the inside of the fridge out of sheer boredom. The only redeeming aspect of this borefest is the trip down memory lane with late 69's TV and movies. Very disappointed.", "Amazing acting performances saves poor story": "I'm a HUGE Tarantino fan. Every movie release is an event with me and my friends. This alone makes his movies a notch better than most. You are never disappointed with the EVENT. You leave the theater saying the 2.5 to 3 hours were worth it. This film isn't an exception. Actually I was surprised when it got to the ending so fast because it didn't seem like we had been in the theater that long.With that said, the problem with this film is that DiCaprio's and Pitt's performances literally carry the 3 hour running time. Unlike his classics, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, that had a stellar script with amazing performances, this one had a C-rated script with Phenomenal performances. As a duo, I think Pitt and DiCaprio's performances were the best of all of Q's films. Even better than Pulp Fiction mainly because I thought S. Jackson was the better out of the two between him and Travolta.The story is basically about a struggling actor who is at the end of his relevance and his friendship with his psychologically more grounded stunt man. This alone is a GREAT premise and really is enough to give those two actors enough material for them to hypnotize the viewers with magical acting.The development of that premise alone would've made this film a beautiful study about male friendships and brotherhood. But instead of completing that story arc, Tarantino abandons it to add, what I think, is a expository on the changing of the guard....or times......or generations......or Hollywood. The point is.....whatever he was trying to say wasn't clear at all. On the surface , if the above mentioned was the secondary premise, it was done WAYYYYY better by the TV series MADMEN . In this film, it just didn't work or gel within the 3 hour time frame. I don't know if he was saying that the Hippie Generation ruined Hollywood or that DiCaprio's character couldn't stomach the change that Hollywood was going through or both . The reason it is was unclear was because it wasn't carefully crafted. As a matter of fact , to me it was developed clumsily by tying the whole story with the Manson killings, especially in the films finale.The end, although taunt with suspense and high in action, was really pointless, except to maybe say that the,\" OLD guard wins at that end\"..... \"Or that they should've won\"...... Either way, this was done better in Tarantino's previous film \". This one, with the few exceptions of DiCaprio's character yelling \"G-D Hippies\", had only one developed set up scene ( of which was done extremely well) and that was with Pitt's character. The next thing we know we are viewing a major battle between the two generations at the end.I gave this one a 6, one of the lowest ratings by me for a Tarantino movie because it ranks right there with his other average film Jackie Brown. The big exception is that Jackie Brown lost points for its acting and not its story. OUATIH is the exact reverse. I seriously think this film desperately needed DiCaprio and Pitt, because without them , we may have actually witnessed a first and that's a failed Tarantino film.", "QT magic": "Quentin Tarantino takes us on a nostalgic ride back to the 1960's. In this movie, Actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) gained fame and fortune by starring in a 1950s television Western, but is now struggling to find meaningful work in a Hollywood that he doesn't recognize anymore. He spends most of his time drinking and palling around with Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), his easygoing best friend and longtime stunt double. Rick also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) -- the filmmaker and budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.Quentin Tarantino's 9th film as a director doesn't have just one story to follow, and for a 2 hours and 40 minutes movie, I think that's suitable. Those stories reflect life in Hollywood from different perspectives (actors, directors, hippies...) to show us how different it was back then. However, despite the fact that these stories were disconnected, Quentin managed to connect them smoothly. If any writer pitched this screenplay to any production house in the world, it would be thrown into the garbage bin, but Tarantino's passion radiated through the movie, as he wrote about the time and place where he, a film enthusiast, fell in love with movies. Moreover, he managed to choose big actors who understood his vision and were able to execute it perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio was of course phenomenal in his role, and so was Brad Pitt who won the Academy Award's Best Actor in a Supporting Role for this movie. And as usual, Margot Robbie played her role with extreme professionalism along countless big name supporting actors.To go back about 50 years from now is not an easy job, but the production design and decorating teams made it feel like a piece of cake. All the set designs, wardrobe, make up, and hair make you feel like you're in Sunset Boulevard or Hollywood Boulevard.Let's make it clear though, the movie isn't for everyone. Even with the action packed ending and the bits of comedy, a lot of people might find the movie really boring and lacking a plot. However, nostalgics would really appreciate this movie and the visuals and phenomenal acting it provides.Score:7.5/10.", "Don't understand the praise": "As for any Tarantino movie, I was expecting something different, something new, something riveting. For sure, this movie is from a genre I'm used to watch. Actually, I don't even know what genre it belongs to... definitely different from anything else.\nOn the positive note, I really liked the atmosphere, visiting this Hollywood from the 60s, the dresses, cars, houses, streets and studios. The music is excellent and serves the movie well.\nSo, what's wrong? Well, first of all, the plot. If you are not familiar with Sharon Tate's story, you won't get it. I read about her afterwards and finally put the pieces together... too late to really enjoy, even retrospectively, the movie.\nThe actors, apart from Pitt, are underused (Margot, where were you?). Why destroying the idea we have of Bruce Lee? What's the point? Why shooting a movie about Sharon Tate's possible tragic ending and not having her present more than 10% of the movie?\nFinally, in my opinion, the movie could have been much more rhythmic if shorten by an hour. When you start checking the news on your mobile in the middle of a movie, it's generally a bad sign...\nIt's not because it's a Tarantino movie that we have to deify it. I read many critics that I just don't get: I would be curious if they would have been similar if the director had been John Smith...", "Complete Washout": "Tarantino was batting 100 until he made this wreck!", "Unique historical masterpiece!": "I watched this a second time, it helps to fully appreciate some minor nuanced features which make the whole movie a joy to watch. Like in the 1960s before seat-belts and speed limits, this movie is an hilarious and exhilirating ride. For the haters, your mothers loved Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth.", "Interesting but not ask well crafted as usual for Tarantino": "I am usually a fan of Tarantino movies. I think of them kind of like comic books and not to be taken too seriously. Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood is a little different. It is really really slow. Probably 45 minutes too long. I'm old enough to remember 1969 and was very entertained by the extreme detail of life in 1969. Most of the cars and backgrounds were pretty accurate. I liked seeing real footage of Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie is pretty but Sharon Tate is hard to replicate. The main characters were well acted. Lots of cameos were cute. I wish Tarantino had performed his usual quality of editing and pacing. We saw much to more detail on preparing dog food distracting from good performances and story line. It is still a movie to watch but not the creator's best effort.", "Great twist to an American tragedy": "Was curious how Quentin would show the Tate murders, but got a nice twist on history. It's like he did Inglorious Basterds. He does revenge movies pretty well. Kill Bill was female revenge. DJango was slave revenge. Inglorious Basterds was Jewish revenge. No one cares about the brutality in this movie if they know what really happened when they went next door. Guess this was a Hollywood revenge movie. The cinematography was great as were there set designs. This film is awesome. Quentin is awesome.", "Simple and beautiful": "It was nice to see Sharon Tate alive in the end.When i see cast and Quentin Tarantino i expect a huge movie but no actually it's just a Hollywood story,something you enjoy.If you want a movie like a puzzle dont watch this.This is just a simple beautiful movie experience", "Why Quentin Tarantino?!": "Yes, the acting is exceptional, but the screenplay is terrible, the climax is lackluster, and I got in a fight with my girlfriend because I told her this movie would be awesome. I hate to say this, but I would rather watch from dusk til dawn. I've been tracking this film for the last year because Tarantino's a genius, but this movie sucks", "Great Flick!": "Filled with great stars and their performances. But, you can always expect that from a Tarantino movie. Julia Butters stole the show with her amazing scenes!", "Switched it off after the first Bruce Lee scene.": "I couldn't watch any more after the first scene with Bruce Lee. Embarrassingly dreadful. I would advise to give it a miss.", "All right": "Not gonna say this is the best movie experience ever. It was like there was good stuff going with Leo and his acting within the acting and the evilness of Margaret Qualley's character but she didn't partake in the murders but I liked how she posed on the street as the peace hippie but there was a dark side and that was cool.", "Good Movie Overall": "This a good movie with overall great acting from everyone. Leonardo brings a excellent acting performance no surprise, being able to play a cheesy actor in 1960 is fantastic. The movie benefits from this. Tarantino is a great director and you can see some of the Tarantino formula here, including feet. i didn't like the portrayal of woman in this movie being careless and messy. Margot Robbie was wasted with her talent. The ending act was easily the best part of the movie although alternating the past. in the end Brad Pitt takes acid and is out of his mind high while dealing with assault and a tense situation. the end is equipped with the Tarantino violence. In the end you should give this movie a look at this is a movie with not a great plot but is not looked at because of the great performances from the two leads.", "Dont know what to say.": "I may have walked out before the good stuff but this movie put me to sleep and I left. Ii'll try again on rental. Terentino usually does not compete with everyone. I just couldnt watch it I was so bored. Maybe because I'm not a country western fan or maybe it was just the style of the movie. Oh well.", "Waste of time and money.": "This has to go down as the most over-hyped and poorly reviewed movie of all time. To say positive reviews are misleading leading is an understatement. You will genuinely be bored out of your brains for 90 percent of the time watching this mess. There's no plot, nothing clever and the dialogue is uninteresting, even for a QT movie. Honestly, save your money and avoid the garbage paid reviews that give this a ten.", "One of my favorite Tarantino's movies": "Overview:\nSet in Hollywood's golden age in 1969, Rick Dalton (Leo) was once the popular actor in western films but now, he is struggling to his next carrier. Cliff Booth (Brad) is Rick's stunt double, and also he is best friend of Rick. Polanski and Sharon live at next to Rick's house.\nIt's about the story of the tragedy in golden age of Hollywood and the life of one actor and one stuntman.Review:\nIt is Tarantino's 9th movie. Before I watched it, I had check out the case of Sharon Tate, and Manson family. In my opinion, some people are crazy about Tarantino's movies, on the other hand, some people can't understand his movies. However, I think it matches to general audiences' preference than other Tarantino's movies because it kept a good pace, was able to follow story-line easily, and didn't have too much violence scenes. In addition, the performance of actors was amazing. Two talented actors, Leo and Brad Pitt led movie all time, and Al Pacino gave us an impact although he was in few scenes in a movie. The last scene didn't betray my expectation, so I realized again it was definitely Tarantino's movie! I highly recommend to watch it, and you will be able to enjoy actors' performance purely!", "Disaster": "I'm a really big fan of his movies, but this one is a total disaster. There is no story, no culmination, every scene is the same. A lot of characters doesn't even fit to the story. Also, the dialog and conversation is really cheap, like I am watching some low budget movie and not Tarantinos movie. The actors are really great, but their acting can't save a bad movie script. Very disappointing.", "A big sloppy mess": "Just walked out of the theatre and I'm still wondering what the hell did i just see on the screen. Tarantino Must have put this movie together while smoking those acid dipped cigarettes. No plot, and an ending that makes you scratch your head and look around. First the positives. The soundtrack is excellent and tarantino really takes you back to 1969 hollywood you actually feel like you are back in time. Pitt steals the movie as the laid back stuntman nearing his golden years. Robbie played a great sharon tate I wish we would have seen more of her on the screen and less of the bromance between pitt and leo. Dicaprio is good as always though at times seemed to be overacting. The whole spahn ranch with the manson followers had great potential but fizzled out like a match. Manson is seen in one scene in the movie and that's it. One thing i did not like is tarantino made bruce lee look like a punk with a washed up stuntman slapping him around. As for the much anticipated ending i thought it was horrible and cartoon like. He should have stuck with the real story not his delusional fantasy. Thumbs down for this movie.", "Tarantino's Love Letter To ... Quentin": "I watched this and simply couldn't come to terms with the fact the movie had ended. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is beautiful, the actors are some of the best you're going to currently find in Hollywood and I think people are just plain interested to see this chapter of our history on the big screen. That being said, I have to then ask myself the big question; was I entertained? Yes.There's no doubt about it how can you not be entertained given the information I've just detailed?\nThe real problem with this film? It's certainly a broken promise. I can (almost) guarantee, while you're watching this film you too will be entertained. And you'll sit watching, waiting and watching, waiting for something ... ANYTHING! But the moment never arrives ... never appears. Not only does this film fall short as a Quentin Tarantino film, this film falls short period!And it's funny reading some of the reviews which gave this travesty a high rating.

I dont know why people are on here saying that he is passed his prime and is just writing bull because compared to hateful eight this was much better. This was right after the metoo movement so i think people hate commented this page just because Harvey was friends with Q and then they were mad that Robbie didnt get much screen time but at the same time it was not a movie about her. It was a movie about two guys getting old and facing the idea they may no longer be in movies or loved by everyone. Not a tate movie. I would say it is not Q's best for sure but it def isnt worth the 7.6 it is at. It should be at least an 8.", "Too slow": "The movie was too slow, had a boring storyline but amazing acting by Pacino, Pitt and caprio which was the best part of the movie", "A-Typical for Tarintino--hoping Trek project is less boring!!!": "I was thrilled to hear Tarantino was doing a Trek film, and figured this film would help boost that anticipation I'm feeling\nIt did the opposite. I'm now less hyped than ever for his Trek project, and considering the ideological turns his most recent film is showing signs of -- I'm leary to say the least about his 10th upcoming project.\nAs for his 9th (this film):Not enough action. No, I wasn't looking for another Pulp Fiction, and what little we got was somewhat realistic--but I seriously expected to see a *SPOILER* Charlie Manson appearance, and hopefully--a murder or two at his hands.\nWhat I got was an off camera post credit assumption that yes, Manson killed these people eventually, about 5 minutes after the credits roll....\nand after seeing the lead up to why maybe Manson chose the victims he did from the characters in the film--it suggested their murder had motive and wasn't just senseless. That was the real insult, we were denied seeing that play out. *SPOILER*What we got, was a double dose of Tarantino's female foot fetish (and unfortunately, no girls desperate to pee like he also tends to throw into the mix--fetishes are fine with me) and some action... but did we need to see Leo freaking out about acting so much? Those scenes would have been better filled by--the Charlie Manson murders I think most of the viewers were expecting.\nI sure was.\nNot as terrible as Ocean's H8, Not as bad as the Supergirl plan to kill all former supermen of the 21st century with their F rated (F as in FAIL) crossover event--but only slightly less disappointing than Avengers and Dark Phoenix turned out being.If this is what we can expect from Tarantino in his 10th film--I hope the 10th is his last, because he's clearly losing steam or had to sell out to some extent to even get his projects green-lit.Sadly, hollywood producers are trying to sell idealism to an audience that just isn't interested in politics when they're tuning in for theatre. Theatre is what we engage in to escape political issues-don't fill our films and series with it anymore. It's very unoriginal, and if you haven't noticed yet: is causing your studios to lose money... to the point Disney can afford to buy them all.", "Tantito is a genius": "Quentin Tarantino did lots of great movies this one might be my favorite, DiCaprio played an astonishing actor which really felt like Leonardo DiCaprio was actually him and not just any actor portraying his character. hats off to Brad Pitt for filling those funny moments altogether with DiCaprio.

It was a good movie but for a Tarantino movie... This wasn't his best work. The entire cast was good. Brad Pitt was really good.. but an Oscar nod?? And a possible win?? For this?? Uhh.. I'm just not seeing why. He was really good in this but definitely doesn't deserve an Oscar for this. He's had much better roles & performances.", "Tarentino at his best!": "This movie won't be for everyone as is normally thay case with Tarentino but those it is for will absolutely love it.

Absolutely brilliant film!", "Mixed emotions": "Not the best of QT but definitely one we can enjoy.", "NOSTALGIC, GOOD MUSIC, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT": "Wow, lots of big names in the movie. I was really excited to watch it. I did enjoy the memories of the 60's. All the attention to detail wasn't lost on me...everything from the clothes, music, and even the radio commercials were authentic. I'm old enough to remember all of it and that's probably what kept me watching the movie.\nUnfortunately, it was way too slow for me and I did fast forward through some parts that seemed unnecessarily long. Although I felt the movie was an accurate depiction of life in the 60's like the carefree attitude, drinking, smoking, watching television, movie making, etc., the movie just didn't have a storyline.\nI had to read one of the spoilers here on this site to figure out the ending. I think the ending was the only part of the movie where something actually happened.\nSo, if you want to take a trip back in time, go ahead and watch it...you'll see some of your favorite actors. But if you're looking for some excitement - you may be disappointed.", "Painfully boring and patriarchic": "I used to be a big QT fan. I ignored the bland trailer and watched this movie anyways. Hours of self-indulgence, celebrating Hollywood and paying endless homage to the good old days.\nMost disappointing was probably that there is no main female character. Margot Robbie seems central in any of the promo material, but you could cut her out of the movie without affecting the story at all. None of the females have any agency. All they are allowed to do is smile, scream and be eye-candy. Just like in the good old days.", "Great acting on a very loosy script.": "Tarantino has a great sense of parody on his own industry. So he needed only the collect some of the most mediocre dialogues from western movies and fill in with weak storyline and very thiny dialogues with no smart writing. Nothing comparable with Tarantino previos well-written scripts.\nSure all the actors and director had fun in ghe shooting.\nFinal 20 minutes saved it to 4stars from zero.", "Ok film.": "The film was ok, but not nearly as awe inspiring as everyone would like to believe. Maybe if the critics would stop blowing Tarantino so much, we could get a honest review.", "It was better than I expected": "Well this movie was a nice surprise.

It is clearly a love letter to 60s Hollywood that can be very enjoyable although it can also feel a bit like it is just meandering in 60s cinema nostalgia. Let's start with the things I liked. I absolutely loved the writing and dialogue but that is kind of to be expected seeing as it's Tarantino. Every performance is kick ass especially Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. And for a movie that is almost 3 hours long it totally doesn't feel like it. The only problems are the story and pacing. The movie kind of feels like it is building up through the entire film and when the end comes it kind of feels a bit unsatisfying. When I first saw it and the credits started rolling I was like \"Wait, it's over?\". I think the point of this movie isn't to make a super encompassing narrative though. Kind of like Dunkirk, and like Dunkirk I think I will like this movie more and more over time and rewatches. Even now though I would highly recommend watching it as it is wildly entertaining. I would give Once Upon a Time in Hollywood a B.", "That.. was a surprise - and a very carthartic one": "Tarantino did a good bait-and-switch on me with this one, although the movie title should've tipped me off.I watched this knowing next to nothing about it, and I know only the bare minimum about the real-world events, but when Sharon Tate and Polanski showed up, I felt pretty sure about the direction this was going (which is exactly what Tarantino wanted I guess).When *that* night approached, with the the time-and-date overlays, I was convinced this was a story based on true events with a few fictional characters thrown in the mix. Needless to say, I was oh-so-wrong. After the slow and deliberate build-up, in the last chapter of the movie you get treated to a very abrupt and jarring transition into Tarantino territory. And then when the credits roll, the next surprise to me was that the movie almost has a feel-good happy end.Performances are top-notch, and without knowing much about the setting, the meticulous attention to detail is obvious. I enjoyed this plunge into the late sixties immensely, and the cathartic burst of violence at the end was the cherry on top.", "Quentin's foot fetish is getting out of hand.": "Seriously, the moment I saw the feet of Sharon Tate I was reminded that this is a Quentin Tarantino movie. Then later we see the feet of the under age nymph \"pussycat\". Both feet are dirty and the one of pussycat has lumps and stuff on them.Anyway, I sorta liked it but something is off about the movie. The whole Sharon Tate thing made me uncomfortable and the entire movie long I kinda wondered if they would portray her horrifying murder by the Manson cultistsThe child actress was absolutely phenomenal. Wow, back in the day most child actors could barely say a line properly. This little girl acted better than most adults.I don't know what I was expecting from this movie, but this wasn't it. It was entertaining, but not as good as I hoped. In the end it feels like a sort of ode by Quentin to Sharon Tate and even to Roman Polanski. Like he made a movie just for Roman or to honor Tate, to act out some fantasy of his to save Sharon Tate. I hope it was more about Tate than Polanski since that guy is accused of some terrible stuff involving children.Tarantino is a weirdo. And that's ok. But it's seriously strange that he has these shots focusing on the feet of actresses every single movie.", "TRASH and anyone who says differently is a paid shill": "WARNING- When reading these reviews, scroll via \"view date' as all early reviews are shills!!

His movies are always cool and unpredictable but this might be in the running with Pulp Fiction as my favorite. The ending was Tarantino on steroids. That's all I'll say.", "Perhaps it has to grow on you": "Being a Tarantino movie you go with some expectations to the theater. The acting was great, but it was slow, minimal story line and what I missed especially was a great soundtrack. Tarantino was so good with that, but now I cannot remember one song from the movie. If this movie would be directed by anybody else I think it would be burned down by the critics. Lets see, it might grow on me, a bit.", "A film needs a story": "We go to the movies to watch a good story don't we? As a huge Tarantino fan, I have never been so disappointed leaving a cinema. First half hour, thought to myself, this is a bit of a slow start for a Tarantino film. After an hour I thought, well the second half of this film should be amazing. 90 mins in, really needed the loo but didn't go because something big is bound to happen any minute now. 2 hours gone, the couple in front of me were also gone, never to return. Final 15 mins and at last some action, but all too little too late. Never thought I'd write this about a film from my favourite director.", "Quentins worst movie so far": "I love Quentins movies so my expactations were high for this one, but sadly it was a big disappointment. The acting is generally good but the movie is uninteresting, slow and gets really boring.\nIf you wanna see a comedy - see something else. If you wanna see an action movie - see something else.I really can't see how this movie got so many nominations for the Oscars especially how it got a nomination for best movie. There\u00b4s some action in the end that\u00b4s pretty cool though.I think he peaked with Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill - this is just a medioker movie and probably Quentins worst.", "Its great and absorbing in detail.": "This film will make you feel like you know a little piece of LA. Flashback to the 70s. Porches, mexican food, movies, the street and bars and fame scene.... I thoroughly enjoyed the genuine acting from these guys. Realistic and down to earth performances. Ironic how this did feel like \"real acting\" as it felt indeed as coming across so real. As if you know these guys personally (You'll know what i mean after you watch it) . But absolutely worth all your time! Maybe not a bucket lister, but its definitely almost up there !!!! 9/10 for sure.", "Not his best work": "I'll keep this simple\nThe very good: Cinematography, acting, soundtrackThe bad: Disjointed story ...i fell asleep twice and had to rewindOnly Quentin Tarantino could have gotten away with this.

Amazing cast and great performance by Leonardo as always. However the first couple of hours are a mismash of biopic and docu type storytelling.I wasn't really enjoying the journey until all of a sudden the final 20 minutes throws up a classic Tarantino gem of a scene.If it weren't for the finale I'd rate this a 4.", "Dumb and Duller...or Dull and Dumber, Same Crap!": "Oh my, oh my.....what a lot of crock that was! Tarantino-shmarantino...never was so much dull and pointelss drivel written by so lauded a fake \"auteur\". I read all the 1-star reviews here, I looked at the overall 8-rating and I thought this must be a case of see-for-myself, what with being open-minded and having enjoyed Django Unchained and Pulp Fiction in the past. So I bought a ticket....and when I finished my popcorn and coke, having watched 40 minutes of mindless dialogue I promptly got up and walked out of the theatre. But here is the good news: YOU do not need to be as silly as me! If you fancy popcorn and coke, just buy the stuff, take it to a bench in the park and listen to the birds sing :))", "Only for the purists": "I simply didn't enjoy watching this film. However, I did appreciate the effort that went into harking back to a bygone age. Everything in this regard was classic Tarantino and many people need to be reminded that he was a slightly obsessive film fan and that is what made his earlier work stand out in the first place.Brilliant as all that is... The film seems like a slap in the face to the consumer as Tarantino himself is essentially type cast and consumers have certain expectations. It is great to see him show his true directorial chops and knowledge, but the product advertised to me was simply not what I ended up watching. That said, this could be a real turning point and we may witness Tarantino transform ala Roman Polanski, who I assume was put in place as a side character for some such link. I could be wrong though.Watch this if you want a cinematic journey and can appreciate what Tarantino is trying to convey, but don't expect old school Tarantino.", "Weird": "Weird. Weird. Weird.Enjoyable, very long. It's as though there are two films going on here simultaneously.", "Strange and fascinating": "QT is now simply showing off his tireless talent through the complexity of the storylines intertwining together. I didn't know what to expect but not such weirdness and over three hours long!! And what's up with the close ups of dirty feet and women snoring - inside joke? I had to look up Tate murders and I am glad QT re-wrote the outcome of that evening giving the memory of those killed a new life. I think this is the first film where I truly came to appreciate Brad Pitt's acting talent.. and Brandy is adorable!", "Awesome :)))": "A movie with a seemingly slow start, but everything amounts into an epic ending that on its own justifies this film as truly masterful.\nThe visuals (cinematography, production design, costumes) and acting throughout were insanely fun and enchanting.The only thing keeping this film from a ten for me is the inclusion of Margot Robbie's character: I love the actress, but I found her character added nothing to the story and could've shaved off a good 10 minutes of runtime, but I guess QT would've lost some premium FOOTage there.", "One of his best, though one needs some 50's-60's knowledge": "After watching I realized: that's part of a trilogy. \"Basterds\" was to present an alternative to WWII and the Holocaust. \"Django\" was to provide an alternative to Black reaction to slavery. \"Once\" was to satisfy those who still bear the scars of the tragedy of the 50's & 60's, culminating in Sharon Tate's ritual-satanic murder, which people who lived through that time still mourn. QT builds slowly, throughout the movie, the basis for the Tate tragedy - symbolizing 1969 - which he replaces with the alternative of two nobodys who could have saved America, and Tate, had the people around Tate paid attention as did those two. They were no heroes, despite their TV exploits. But Pitt noticed the hippie camp, which we thought was a boring addition, and the leggy girls were working for Satan. The movie presents an alternative to how America could have been saved. That's not the first time QT touches the subject of fate. See \"Pulp\" and its theme \"kissmet\", which in Turkish means fate. Good stuff, though you require patience and stop waiting for fast action like Statham's movies.", "Go read the story it is based on first": "For people that don't know the story it is based on, this movie doesn't make a lot of sense. But if you do know it, this movie is one of the best of QT.", "Such a great cast wasted!": "Pretty much all of Tarantino's movie have some great scenes with lot's of garbage. Tarantino is way overrated. What a waste of many talented actors", "That Tarantino Vibe": "Love it or hate it, Tarantino movies just have that little something that sets them apart. He really lets the actors act, with an especially strong showing from Leo DiCaprio. There's a scene where Dicaprio (The actor) has to play a character (who is also an actor) performing a scene in a fictional movie, and do a bad job, followed by doing the same scene again but doing it well. It's incredible.", "Let down": "Had very high expectations but was let down by the lack of a plot and boring scenes. The movie is all style and no substance. I get QT wants to pay homage to Hollywood (and himself?), but constant pop culture references are a cheap pander to a certain audience that do not make a great movie. The few themes in the movie are spoon fed, the dialogue is not witty, the characters predictable and boring.The acting, direction, and style are great but even Brad Pitt driving around for 3 hours is boring. I don't see a phenomenal movie here, I'm shocked at the reviews. The story had potential, the actors delivered, but the script and plot fell short. 5 minutes of gruesome violence do not make up for 2 and a half hours of boredom.Sharon Tate's character could've been completely cut. Her big moment was being amused by people's reaction so that we feel empathy for her? Or that we thought she would get killed? Lackluster, given the 30 or so minutes developing her story which was not entertaining.The girl Brad Pitt befriended was not in the final sequence. Wouldn't that have made for more interesting dialogue?The first fifteen minutes setup a very interesting story but it winds up dragging on and on and on until over the top violence that somehow got cheers", "Great in parts. Poor in others.": "Have mixed feelings about this film. Loved how it was made, filmed, scored and directed. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were both great. The story was good in parts but just ridiculous in others. The film reflects Quentin Tarantino's personality which is part genius, part man baby. I know it was meant to be a fantasy version of that period, but to me it was just weird and stupid.", "Not Your Typical Tarantino Film, But Definitely a Classic": "I just watched Tarantino's latest film, \"Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood.\" This film truly surprised me, because it is not your typical Tarantino film, but it was a love story, and how the magic of Hollywood can turn a nightmare into a fairy tale.I mean once you understand your fictional characters and if you know your real world history around the time frame this film takes place in, you are left with unease, but unmistakable interest to what you know the closure point to be, and then it pulls a Keyser Soze on you. Intertwining the non-fictional with the fictional into a partially real life story mixed in with a historical love story, that could end in a fairy tale like fashion. It's genus, and leaves you, well it left me with complete and utter satisfaction upon the conclusion of Tarantino's ninth episode with one more to go until his finale.I definitely recommend seeing this film. Some may not be able to get through it, others will find it extremely boring, but I hope many find it to be another Tarantino classic, although it's definitely different from his previous installments.", "His lone misfire..": "Don't get me wrong.. this isn't a \"bad\" film.. by any stretch! But, although I enjoyed it, I couldn't help but notice that it completely lacks the signature hallmarks that are typically associated with a Quentin Tarantino film.. specifically, scenes, settings & DIALOGUE that GENUINELY and relentlessly, create tension between the characters.. and ultimately drive the motivations & plot forward.As much as I enjoyed this brief nostalgic trip through the Hollywood of yester-year.. I do genuinely believe that this film will, in due time, ultimately be regarded as Tarantino's lone misfire.", "Criminal waste of talent and time": "QT has committed serious crime in wasting Leo, Brad and Al Pacino. Two and half hours of utter gibberish going nowhere. Only one star for Leo to entertain us in his flagship acting in some scenes.", "Brad & Margaret": "Brad Pitt and Margaret Qualley really steal the show! Every week they share the sorts really fly. Between her youthful exuberance and Brad's laid back cool the two captured the spirit of the film. The ride out to the Spano Film Ranch had me smiling for the whole day.", "Tarantino's most misguided, slight narcissistic, but cool moments film.": "This movie had some really cool visuals. There were a few moments I laughed out loud. The scene within a scene, Leo acting in other films was really cool. Brad was funny.\nLeo with a flamethrower is classic. But I can't help but feel throughout 3/4 of this movie that it was just full of itself, and Hollywood elite stuff none of us care about or relate to.I like buddy cop movies (in this one, two, aging actor/stunt double combo) but for 3 hours and with no story? Can't say it worked just for a thrown in violent ending (which is not as great as everyone is making it out to be) with no other characters returning or really doing much.I'm a massive Tarantino fan, but I feel like this idea was not fully developed or even about anything worthwhile. Yes, we understand the changing of times, the struggling to adapt, the Manson murders, but we also understand that Hollywood is completely full of itself, and that's how this movie feels.Maybe it will grow for me like the Hateful Eight did, but as of right now this stands at the bottom for Tarantino films.", "what a pompous pile of garbage": "Nothing good to see here. DiCaprio is the only real acting force and he's crippled by a horrible script.", "I usually like Tarentino - but not this time.": "This movie is just awful. Slow, boring and unsatisfying bizarre non-historic ending. No A list actors could have made this movie any better. Just one extremely random scene after another. They tease Charles Manson early in the film with a brief appearance and he never reappears. WTF? The film is about an hour too long and pretty much no plot. Can't understand the good reviews. Don't waste your time.", "What was the storyline?": "I was waiting to see it for so long and was very excited about it when it finally came out and then left the cinema theater very disappointed.I kept waiting and waiting something to happen, some interesting plot, story or whatever you may expect from Mr. Tarantino but none of that happened. The movie for me was the last 15 minutes. That part was the most exciting and most enjoyable and it felt like a Tarantino movie. But that's all.I feel like he did this movie because he is so nostalgic about 60s and he just wanted to feel what is it like to make a movie about 60s without any plot or story in mind. The dialogue didn't feel like other Tarantino movies except few lines where you may think \"ohhh yeah that sounds familiar\".There were a lot of scene where you feel like something gonna happen but again nothing happens, it is just a normal scene with pointless dialogues and nothing happens at all.I think that's the problem with the whole movie - nothing happens, nothing to be excited for. Yes it had that 60s feeling but we wanted to watch some of those Tarantinoesque story lines. Disappointed.", "Hmmm...": "Like others have said, this movie goes nowhere. The movie is just missing something. Although the ending was the most entertaining part of the movie, I think it would've been better if the actual events of the horrific night would have played out like it really happened. With our stars with some near misses with the Manson famiily and no clue with what was going on next door.", "Self indulgent": "While this was beautifully done and had s great cast I found it rather self indulgent on the part if Tarantino and I dislike the way he changes history to suit his stories. Rather slow and dull.", "The worst Tanrantino movie by far": "I really looked forward to liking this, after being somewhat disappointed with the Hateful Eight. However, this movie is even worse. So many pointless scenes (like seriously, do I really need to watch the entirety of Brad Pitt driviving home and chill in his van?). The movie also lacks both clever dialogues, and suspension build up that are Tanrantino's hallmarks. All in all, I give it a 6/10, mainly because the cinematography is excellent, but if it wasn't made by Tarantino, I doubt I would give it higher than a 5.", "garbage": "Only garbage\nwithout beginning, without end\nanother nonsense movie", "Just ok": "Very drawn out although still has that's Tarantino magnetism. The acting is superb though", "Conflicted about this flick": "This movie has some great themes-friendship and loyalty, the challenge of aging, career decline and reinvention, moral codes and the differences between kindness and evil...all wrapped up in a story about acting and Hollywood. The acting is great by everyone and the story is interesting. The thing about this film that is disturbing is realizing that Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring were mercilessly murdered, and the Manson family killers were not stopped. So whats the point of this storyline? Somehow it seems disrespectful of the memory of the deceased to create an alternate happy ending for what was a horrible crime. That's what has left me conflicted about what is otherwise a very good movie.", "Style Over Substance?": "Firstly I would like to say I thought this was the most beautifully shot movie I have ever seen. It really transports you straight to that era and the attention to detail is phenomenal. The acting as others have said is faultless and there will be awards.\nThe problem with this film is it has nearly two hours of bland meandering which is quite interesting but nothing special. The majority of this movie is actually quite dull.\nThere are very funny parts and there are very violent parts but apart from the beautiful cinematography this movie is pretty average.\nOnce people stop thinking they have to give it 10/10 because they are experts in cinema and it's the cool thing to do the IMDB rating will drop to around 7.5/10.\nThere will be lots of people going to see this with 10/10 expectations and many of those people will leave disappointed.

Me, my ass was aching after 30 minutes and after 1hour I couldnt take it anymore and left. Nothing had happened until then, except for the usual closeups of Brad and Leos faces.

Most of the film could be left out.It's like a sewn together timeline of individual good moments, but together it makes no sense.Not great.Go see it and make your own judgement though. You might enjoy it. I just didn't.", "See-worthy because it's Tarantino, but that's all..": "Tarantino changes alot of his tune for this one. Love the guy. Been a loyal fan for decades. However I may say this one was a bit of a snore fest, for me at least...+ Epic music as usual. Great photo and camera work.The script. The boring dialogue and the style of storytelling, did not like it. Also an unusual pretentious and flat performance from some of the actors and actresses.Tarantino, you can do better than this!\nI'll be waiting for the next Kill Bill. Cheers!", "Insulting to Bruce Lee and the Asian culture": "I was totally angry with the way they portrait Bruce Lee in the movie. Made him a phony arrogant a**hole who is full of himself. Completely disrespectful to the person himself, his family, and the entire culture.", "Beautiful": "Sit back and relax as Tarantino takes a time warp back to the 1960s, where tv cowboys, Marlboro cigarettes, and a hard margarita were at their peaks", "headline": "Solid film with the lead duo's chemistry feeling authentic, their individual arcs were a pleasant experience to watch. Although the presence of Robbie was enjoyed, her story, along with certain other characters, did feel overstretched and at times pointless.

However, in the previews I did not realize this was a gruesome semi-true story of what happened to Sharon Tate and others, until I had invested all of my time in the film. What started off as a 75% great film ended in a gruesome and unwatchable horror film that I had to turn off. The preview showing for this movie made no correlation that it would end as a horror film based on the charles manson murder in Hollywood. Gross film, don't know how people can watch horror and rate it as a good film. Disgusted", "So sixty": "Di Caprio and Pitt at top, in the last years Brad Pitt grove up in my personal actors top ten list till the apex!\nThe film is 100% Tarantino style, and that's why I love it!", "new era": "It's a contemporany kind of artistic movie, not a Tarantino classic, as for life description. Bit borring but with steps and other kind of Hollywood, more realistic, life passages!", "Not for everyone. Great acting.": "I recognize is not a movie for everyone, if you are a F9 person or you are the movie watcher that watches super pop corn movies. This is not a fun movie for you, is slow paced, lots of talking and boring at times.If you like drama, build up and good acting you will enjoy this movie a lot.Di Caprio performance is fantastic.", "Questionable": "There are great performances in this movie, disturbing scenes, fascinating perspectives, and beautiful shots. But I cannot get over the shameful portrayal of Bruce Lee. Shameful.", "Totally disappointed": "I could not believe how disappointing this movie was. The cast was full of nothing short of an all-star lineup. So many favorites but the storyline was so slow I kept losing interest. It felt as though half the script was missing as if they changed the direction midstream and then tried to turn back again.", "Tarantino did it again... or did not?": "Due to fashion people and models admire Tarantino, this film is again accomplishment in that purpose, though for a regular spectator the film can be a disappointment.\nThere is no actual plot, and we are forced to watch beautiful cars, daily life of aging actors (DiCaprio and Pitt) in skin tight jeans in beautiful LA sunshine. There are also beautiful women who don't have any role in the process except getting married.\nBut everything is stylish, very stylish.\nIt is a surprise that there are no typical Tarantino twists (ill-omened visit to hippie community does not lead to action etc) and that's why the movie is overall surprise. More descriptive than unpredictable.", "Great what-if story": "I usually am not too impressed with Tarantino's self indulgent films but this one gives a loving romantic wink and nod to a Hollywood gone by. I can understand QT's fans that think this is his worst movie but I think it's one of his best. It's pace is deliberate, like watching an artist paint a picture. DiCaprio and Pitt are both wonderful without being over the top. Pitt steals every scene he's in, and I think he earned his Oscar. In the end though, the real stars are a dog and a flamethrower.", "I came into the theatre a lil late, was my only 2nd Tarantino film i watched at the cinemas.": "Was a great piece of tarantino film, but felt it was a linear story, without something to say, and he Inglorious Basterded the ending. Definitely watch this movie when you have the chance", "hear me out": "I loved the aesthetic of the entire movie. i was also glad to see a positive change on history....but by the end of the film i was sadly disappointed. i will probably see it again because i can't stop thinking about it and i hope my initial opinion will change...not a typical tarantino film, but a cool spin on one. i recommend giving it a chance even if you aren't impressed by the plot, the vibe is amazing.", "I'm not reviewing. Just happen to look over the cast..": "There's literally one Asians and one African American. I realize it's 1969, but I think there were plenty minorities then too.", "good": "It\u00b4s a good movie, good plot, shows the history of cinema and actors in those days. It can be boring at moments if you are not interested in that. The last part is very violent like the director\u00b4s movies.", "Tarantino's worst movie ever!!!": "Very disappointing movie indeed. I don't care about the so talked about 'era', the 60's or the 70's or what so ever. This is a work of an amateur. It's a waste of time to watch this movie :(It's not worth it! With all do respect, if there is a zero star rating, this movie should be rated so.Yeah, once upon a time... indeed!\nThank you Tarantino. Great job!", "Definitely not worth it": "I'm a big fan of Brad and Leo and their performance was brilliant, but the movie itself made me believe I was either high or drunk: there is no connection between scenes, there is no storyline and things seemed randomly built. I would not recommend this.", "Breathtaking.. Pitt and Leo made it lit": "Great music, Pitt and Leo complementing each other, hippie vibes. Pitt playing off his character easily and owned it like a boss.", "Not nearly as good as everyone on here says!": "First, let me say I love Tarantino movies, but this one just fell flat. Except for the last 20 minutes this movie drags on and on without much to keep your attention. There's lots of star power in the cast, but the story just seems to drag on without really going anywhere. Maybe to people in the movie industry this is more entertaining but to the normal person on the street there isn't much here. Really a disappointment!", "Utter crap!": "Other than to rewrite the Manson murders! What the hell is the point in this movie? There is no plot, no story? Just endless scenes of tarantino trying to be different and failing tragically? Do not waste two and a half hours of your life on this giant, steaming pile of crap!", "One of the IF NOT the tamest Tarantino film so far": "I recommend knowing all about the Manson killings before watching this movie to fully enjoy it, no actually just watch it and cry cause this movie friggin' ends.", "Like music without sound or a book without words. Nothing basically.": "It happens to all artists. They have their peaks and then they fade. It is inevitable. It is normal. Natural. There are few exceptions like Rolling Stones and may be late David Bowie. One has to understand this and do not expect talents, no matter how great they are, to last forever.", "loooooooooong ....": "This felt as if I was on a very loooong flight that I couldn't get off from. I was fidgeting and my ass... was hurting for sitting that long.... I would of get up and left half way in, but because my friends took me and purchased tickets I just had to suffer till the end :( This would of been great flick if it was half the length...as cinematography was excellent and acting, writing not so much and only action you get is on the end of the movie. Ouch lol", "Dont get confused , this is not an action movie": "I know a lot of people gave this movie a bad review mainly because they expected an action movie with Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio. Expecting that , they missed to see a perfectly written and directed movie.I had a blast watching this movie. Tarantino made the old Hollywood come back to life. The reincarnation of that time is just lovely to see and makes you nostalgic but the movie has soo much more to offer besides just looks and design.The characters are well written and both Cliff and Dalton have a nice arc till the end of this movie. Quentin can make almost any scene suspensful and interesting and you will definitely find that here.I love how certain little minor things shown in the beginning of the movie come back by the end in the most epic way ( For example , scene showing how Clif Booth's dog is well trained ).This is a type of a movie that you either 110% like or 110% hate. It is not made for everyone and not everyone can appreciate how well most of the scenes are written and directed you just HAVE to see this movie yourself so don't miss it.It is not a thriller movie , it is a movie that will bring you to a happy place while you are eating warm popcorns.PlatinumanYT 8.2/10.", "Do not watch without knowing the events it based on!": "Having no clue what this movie was based on or about when I watched it, and because I have already seen it, it's sad that I will never get to enjoy it. While watching I thought it was so slow and boring and turned it off a few times. The plots seem to just exist but never seem to tie together. The uber violence is too much and didn't make any sense. So as movie in itself, it wasn't great.Now if you know the premise and the event surrounding it before watching it would be a completely different movie. Slow building suspense that comes to a head when you see a couple sick people get what they should have gotten that night. You have to know that it is a remaking of history otherwise it just makes no sense why they are following Sharon around, and I would have thought, due this fact they would have somehow clued you in to what actually happened. Much like \"Inglorious Bastards\" there is something gratifying about watching people get what they deserved, even if its fake.", "It's pretty good, if you understand the back story.": "I found this movie intriguing, but only because I have seen so many Charles Manson documentaries and adaptations. The tension in the movie is built by knowing what will eventually happen to these people, but if you are unaware of who these people are, you may get bored. I suspect a lot of the reviews that said it was horrible, had no plot, and was too long, were from people who did not understand the connection with the Manson gang. Even so, it was a bit repetitive, and much of the movie seemed to be about waxing nostalgic instead of advancing the story.", "self indulgent mess": "It's ok to have a love of old movies, but when you over indulge in homage and forget to tell a story you are not really making a movie for anyone but yourself.\nsure this movie is shot with the director showing all his cinematographic tricks, but he forgets that viewers sometimes expect more. like a coherent plot line and characters we can relate to, like or dislike. this rambling and ultimately unsatisfying trip through the late sixties is not worth your time.", "Pointless and confusing": "There is no real story/plot in this movie. It is going nowhere and just seems to be a lot of random namedropping. I sort of get the feeling that Tarantino wanted to make a Coen brothers movie and failed. Good acting though, and good set/costume/props which is why I give it 4 Stars.", "I got a love/hate relationship": "Unlike most of the reviews I enjoyed the first half of the movie and didn't like the rest. The first half was all about the vibe, the beauty of the 60s as well as introducing the characters that I found very intriguing! The second half was just weird and didn't make much sense! I agree with most people saying there was no storyline, I honestly still don't understand what the movie was about. It seemed way confusing, switching scenes and different people constantly without any point. There was no connection to each scene. I wanna love it and I do love parts of it especially how good the cast was, how precise he showcased the time back then and THE MUSIC. Which I always love in his movies! But there was something missing in the story and even though most ppl seemed to like it I thought the last 15 min were just ridiculous... not in a funny way just plain stupid. The killings were so over the top ...to me not in a cool way! I miss the old QT movies. Anyway I'll rewatch to give it another try!", "I'm giving this 2 one for Brad and the other for leonardo that is it really.": "The acting was very good by the two wish I seen more of Al Pacino.\nSo no storyline nothing exciting till the last 10-15 minutes from a director who is well known for that.\nI don't know if I'm missing something but giving this film a rating of 8.4 is way overrated in my opinion", "Collossal Joke": "Finally saw this movie on cable last night. What a colossal waste of talent, money, and time.Watching the 60's in Los Angeles roll by was kind of, it was a fascinating decade.Watching Rich Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) bang around his demons while failing to stop drinking and make the most boring Western ever put to film was pointless.Watching Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) strut around the set and take his shirt off isn't anything we haven't seen before when he was younger.Watching Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) float around the scenery was nice, and she was able to convey a '60s mood, but was that acting?Then after about two hours when you expect to happen doesn't happen, it all dissembles into fractured dust.What did I just watch? Quentin Tarantino playing a huge joke on the audience. What an insult to the viewers. If Tarantino had half the ego, this would have been twice the movie.", "Revisionist history with great technical value": "It's a Western where Hippies are the bad guys.Technically very well made, very good cars, sets and costumes, a great reconstruction of the era, expect for the revisionist Manson storyline which seems like the wet dream of a trope-like 60s conservative man who hates evil dirty hippies. Is it a satire?The historical subject matter around the murders and the family is only explored extremely superficially and underplayed. It seems like most of the interesting parts about the family were cut out in favor of boring Western film set dialogue.The scenes with the Manson girls, hitchhiking and roaming around the city collecting food and also all scenes with Margot Robbie are tough brilliantly acted and the highlight of the film.Lots of time-period film references, weird how Dragnet \"the Blue Boy\" episode wasn't featured.Really cool to see Bruce Dern, one of the typical B-movie biker gang movie actors.What ultimately ruins the film for me:The scene discrediting a martial-arts hero is stupid and unhonourable !", "I made an account just to review this movie": "Terrible, any rating above three is simply blind tarantino meat riding. Do you like your movies to have plot? Well you're barking up the wrong tree with this one. You wait for over two hours for the movie to start just to be let down. Do not see the movie unless you have a Margot Robbie foot fetish because in that sense Tarantino delivers", "A long boring story": "This film has literally NO SENSE. It is a long and boring patchwork of dull scenes that culminates in an even more stupid and meaningless ending. I gave it two stars only for the good acting. Almost three hours of my life wasted.", "beautiful visually, but very weak story": "This film is a Tarantino visual montage of a time in Hollywood which he obviously adores. But even though i enjoyed watching some of these well-acted vignettes, the lack of a real plot here made this one forgettable.", "Not the best Tarantino's work, but still good": "Great acting, brilliant dialogues. A love letter to the 60-s in every way.", "Very enjoyable": "Great film,Pitt and DiCaprio are excellent actors...\nI'm not usually a fan of these sort of films but enjoyed every minute of it...", "A crime against cinema": "A crime against cinema and viewers is just randomly collected scenes", "Not Your Daddy's Caddy": "I was almost 1/3 through watching this before the LIGHT went off that allowed me to appreciate what QT was up to in this wonderful masterpiece that defies any and all expectations one might have walking into a theatre to see it. Therefore it is quite understandable that a lot of people did not like this film -- even fans of his previous works who consider this one to be too weird and his worse film. Again, the genius artist has simply ran too far ahead of (most) of his audience. So what follows is my understanding of what the film is DOING -- confirmed by statements I heard afterwards from publicity interviews, but which I had a strong inkling of as the LIGHT went off until the end of the film.#1. This is not a film ABOUT the Brad Pitt and Leo D. characters: it is a film about Hollywood DURING the time when they are shown to be active. This story about Hollywood rests on two hinges: the transition from the Cowboy series TV dominate era (where someone like Clint Eastwood could emerge from Rawhide to become Dirty Harry and \"the rest is history\"; but more importantly the hinge of Before and After the Sharon Tate murder.#2. In Revising the historical facts so boldly: What would have happened if, instead of falling upon a pregnant woman and her friends, these hippy creeps would have got their comeuppance at the hands of a stunt man and a TV movie star? What would have been the alternate experience of the whole of Hollywood and American culture if things on that night had turned out as QT imagined? I imagine that folks who live through it experienced his alternative telling as a deeply cathartic fantasy. Thanks QT for feeling and healing our pain.#3. There is a very telling saying of the great photographer Ansel Adams. \"My greatest fear was that I would become an imitation of myself.\" QT has broken the sound barrier in creating what is practically a new cinematic genre: a quasi-social psychological therapeutic historical revisionism. I know that is a mouthful, but it seems to capture most of what is going on in this deep, deep film.I simply marvel at what this man will do NEXT.Thank you QT.", "What a pity": "If you have too much free time, you can watch that rubbish.", "Gets better with repeat viewings.": "This movie is made to be watched again and again. It doesn't really have a plot which has is fine by me. Pitt is great and people loved him in this but Leo actually has the better performance. He's absolutely hilarious as the drunk actor on the downside of his career in late 60s Hollywood. So many cameos and great sets. Leo was the comedic heart of the film, fun scenes about old Hollywood, and one of the most entertaining endings of the last 20 years.", "Love QT but didn't like the hippie steteotype": "It had some great camera stunts. I loved the t.v. Watch For It. Otherwise it wasn't the way it was.", "Confused Quinten Tarantino": "Mundane Story. Great Performance. Overrated. Tarantino with his new story of the film Once Upon A Time in Hollywood seems confused. In the movie he somehow loses the track at which character to focus. Just because of this the three lead characters in the film Rick Dalton, Cliff Booth and Sharon Tate appear to be not attended as a whole by him in the main storyline. Contrarily, the acting done by the actors is much satisfying. Leo has perfectly played the role of a typecast villain who is hesitant to play other roles. Brad, on the other hand might disappoint because he seems to play his character without much effort. Margot Robbie has flawlessly played the role of an emerging actress who is not much recognised on the streets of Los Angeles. But simply stowing several great actors with their outstanding performance history in a single film doesn't make that film blockbuster. Storyline also matters and that ought to be clear and focusing. But have to say this that Tarantino finally succeeds to jab his famous parts of gore violence, bloodshed and butchery in the end of the movie, no matter what he was showing earlier in the film that is some emerging and famous hollywood actors.", "Very Good....If You're Old Enough To Remember 1969": "The movie features an alternative end to the Manson family murders of 1969. If you don't know your history, much of the movie will be meaningless. Not only do you need to know the Manson family history (including the relationship of Charles Manson to Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys and Terry Melcher, Doris Day's son), you also need to at least know Sharon Tate, Steve McQueen (including his TV series \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" and his movie \"The Great Escape\"), and Bruce Lee (including his first starring role in the TV series \"The Green Hornet\").", "Something unexpected": "Coming out of the cinema I was confused, yet I felt completed. Without saying to much it was everything I never thought would happen. Of course we all know how Tarantino likes to rewrite history on his own behalf but this was so different. The acting was great, the famous Easter eggs were there, the camera work was amazing and the pure gory-ness of Tarantino was perfect, not forgetting to mention the nostalgia that \"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" gives you. But I have to say this, I was worried about halfway into the film. And that was mainly because I had a difficult time understanding the connection between the mason family and Tate & Dalton and I was confused of how low the pace was from time to time (not super Tarantino-like) however all my questions were answered in the end.\nTruly terrific, best 2 hours and 45 minutes in a long time.\nThank you Tarantino.", "Wanted to love it, but found myself yawning instead ...": "If the movie were a heartbeat; the pulse was so low, CPR would have been required.I kept waiting for it to pick up the pace and the storyline to evolve. A couple of times it started to have a pulse and then flatlined again. It just drug on and on. Often, I found the dialogue and scenes so mind-numbingly slow that my thoughts drifted off. Found myself periodically glancing at my watch to see how much longer I was going to have to sit through this movie. At least four times the boredom resulted in actual yawning.The only reason I even gave this movie four stars is for: 1) Nostalgia; music and cinematography. 2) The actors involved. 3) Their acting ability. 4) The ending scene.For me, the ending (last ten minutes or so) was the best part of the entire film. It flipped the script on evil and was a big FU to it. And, done in a classic QT style. Unfortunately, it couldn't compensate for the painfully boring 2-hours that proceeded it.If you saw the movie and loved it, I am happy for you! That just wasn't my experience.", "Good acting performance BUT so long and confusing...": "It was good for who loves watching films from best actors. But it was so confusing and so segmented movie. It could be better...", "Well acted but that's all, just awful.": "Terrible excuse for a movie!\nYou know what you're getting with Leo and Brad but the movie was a stinker and nothing more than a load of scenes poorly stitched together with no coherence whatsoever.\nQuentin over indulges his strange dirty foot fetish like never before in this awful attempt at film making.\nI sincerely hope this wasn't QT's swansong as it needs to be consigned to movie room 101.", "Terrible, terrible, terrible!!": "No plot, no storyline, no point, what a waste of time. Thought about walking about 1hr and 30 mins. Totally regret no doing so. Enjoyed every QT up to this but this is absolutely terrible! Seriously, do not waste the time!", "Actors saved it": "This movie is so much different than honestly everything. I feel like it's a movie that not going to be understood they way it's supposed to because for me it didn't. The actors are obviously perfect, so many people you already knew mixed with a slight variation of people we didn't. When i watched this movie for me it took way to long to get interesting. the storyline didn't start and i was bored. The actors kept it sort of exciting. About half way through the storyline started. The whole cowboy western vibes aren't really my thing but i can live with it. I just feel like the whole Italian movie stuff was added for fun because afterwards i can't remember half of it. They should've sticked to the hippie vibes because that's the only thing that mattered in the end anyway, and i get that they need to add some sub-plots but this movie stuff was going on for half of the damn movie. Each time i was kind of waiting for all the Rick Dalton and Sharon Tate stuff to pass so I could watch the actual storyline. Brad Pitt obviously did amazing especially in the end. That's probably the scene i liked the most just because you actually knew what the frick was going on. Also the whole thing with Sharon Tate? Was it really necessary? it didn't add anything to the actual plot because when i watched it i thought maybe the two storylines will combine at the end? It didn't? So why did they add it? So my opinion, storyline isn't that great but because of the actors they still ended up with a good movie!", "Last 10 minutes saved this horse shi- film": "The movie was blaa blaa blaa with more blaa blaa bla. Stupid topic if you couldn't fill in the details. With those amazing actors and that is all the director gives them. What sorry direction. I know nobody will read this. Waist of your time. The director (I know he is famous) should pay you to watch it except for the last 10 minutes when he finally had a a good movie. And don't say that was building, it was not building, just boring.", "Booooooring": "An extremely boring movie, I came out of the cinema for the first time.", "Dialogue that is enough to keep you interested": "While not a full of action film like we have seen with other Tarantino Films like Django, this for some reason had me sucked in just for the talking.Decent character depth without going into their family history or their up-bringing is what really impressed me the most. You felt like you knew the character well enough with just their acting alone - Especially Brad Pitt.Some flat spots and the odd thing happens which really leave you guessing but isn't that in all Tarantino movies?7 Stars for terrific acting by the main 2 boys and outstanding rugged dialogue!!!", "Overestimated...": "This is unfortunately the first boring Tarantino movie...a repeated act from DiCaprio, an absent Margot and a tolerable Pitt...10 last minutes won't save the movie...", "Well, that's a bad movie": "The movie has no plot, only good actors that are just not enough to save it.It you take the brand names (DiCaprio, Pitt, Tarantino, Al Pacino, etc) you are left with an empty movie.", "Waste of a brilliant cast!": "I can't believe what a failure the ending was! I gave it a chance, 1.5 hours in, still nothing really happened, no plot nothing. Being a Tarantino you have to see it through right?\nGreat acting and fantastic cast but what a waste of 90 million!\nNo real storyline just a crazy killing scene at the end.Basically one of the main characters gets targeted by hippies \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffdNot sure if I'm glad I've watched it or not. What a let down!", "Could last 5 min. Yawn.": "Just leave Bruce Lee fight scene and the doggy carnage from the end, please don't include the the di don't care Oscario.", "Much more slow paced and different Tarantino flick": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a masterpiece grade movie but it might not be for everyone. If you've seen most of Tarantino's work then you'll be able to recognise his signature writing and cinematography which still hold up as some of the best in the industry, however the pacing of this film is where it may loose some more impatient audience members. It is a far more story focused flick and there really is not any action until the end but that action is hilarious and very much worth the wait, and that wait makes it all the more satisfying, I won't spoil it because you should see for yourself. The acting was as expected an absolute knockout and even exceeded my expectations at points, Tarantino really brings out the best in Leonardo DiCaprio and pretty much everyone else in the cast. Brad Pitt stood out the most to me and he delivered some of the most memorable lines in the film (once again I won't spoil what they are but those who have seen the movie know what i'm talking about and if you haven't seen it you will easily be able to recognise them if you do watch it.) The attention to detail is brilliant and works very well with this movies excellent world building moments. The late 60's setting is very vivid and believable, if you are going to see this movie I would also advise to take some time to study the Manson family and the Sharon Tate murders, trust me, it will vastly improve your experience with the already brilliant ending. overall this film is a masterpiece and I highly recommend you see it so long as you're OK with its more mature pace and long run time.", "Something is missing": "This newest tarantino film makes fun of the Manson gang. That in a way that you can question. The LaBianca / Tate murders were so insane and horrible that I wonder if you should portray this in this way. Although the film is nicely made, I feel that a lot is missing and, above all, it is very, very long. I personally experience that as a pity.", "Leonardo DiCaprio in the Trailer After he forgot his lines!": "The scene with Leonardo in the trailer cursing himself after he forgot his lines was pure gold. One of the best 3 minutes of acting in Cinema history.", "Such a disappointment": "Quentin Tarantino, Leo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie. What could go wrong? Apparently a lot of things.\nOne of the most awaited films, rich of talent, is an absolute snore fest.\nFirst 2 hours are following 3 seprate storylines of 3 chracters and out of 3 only Brad Pitts one was mildly interesting while other 2 had no sense or purpose. It was so boring I could not belive it was a Tarantino flick.\nLast 15 minutes filled with action, humor and gore are some of the Tarantinos finest and are the only saving grace of this movie.All in all this movie is long and boring and HAS NO PURPOSE, it finishes with a bang that saves this movie from being absolutly horrible.", "Ranks up there with the worse movies I have seen.": "I just don't see what all the hype is about. Take the f word and variations out and you are left with half a movie's worth of dull script. Poorly portrayed characters in whom I felt no connection nor interest. Violence introduced for the hell of it, at which point I walked out. Overlong and overblown.", "Lame...until...": "Up until the last ten minutes this is the most pointless movie ever. Then the ending redeems it. Almost. Within a whisker. Brad Pitts character should have had his own movie or universe ala MCU. I get it that it's Tarantinos love letter or whatever. It's just a day in the life of..... And then the flame thrower", "Hurts to be this honest": "It was boring. I kept looking at my watch and waited for the end. There were way to many endless long scenes.\nThe storytelling was not at all what I expected.\nThe only good things about the movie were Leo, Brad and Margot. Unfortunately there characters were also lame.", "Not all roads lead to home.": "The story of this film is long, branching and overall quite interesting. I'll get the technical aspect out of the way: it's fantastic, well shot, well edited, well lit, etc. The story needs work, its the only reason this isn't a 9. There were plot points in this film that went absolutely nowhere and it really bothered me, it felt like Tarantino was developing a character just for fun so he could never use them again. This is not a good way to develop a story, I would be ok if the two stories overlapped, and while they do a little bit, it's nowhere near enough for it to work.You should see this film, it's fantastic, it's award worthy, but it's flawed and as long as you can understand that, then you'll be fine.", "What a waste...": "I feel kinda disappointed, since I was expecting a completely different movie. I've seen only the trailer and haven't really read anything what should the film be about before going to see it. I was sitting here 3 hours, with no clue what the hell is going on. I was truly confused, I liked the historical setting and stuff, but there wasn't much of a story going on. For people, who haven't lived in that era, the movie is hard to understand. I would recommend going through wikipedia and learning something about the Hollywood in 60s, maybe even watch some movie/tv series from that age. You will enjoy the movie much more. Seriously, now reading through all the other user reviews, I think I missed out something big, and really just because I didn't know the historical references..", "Quentin Tarantino fan": "I like the majority of Tarantino movies. That doesn't mean I'm biased, just that I like his style. This is up there with his best movies.Comedy, action and almost slapstick violence, which has context and doesn't dominate the storyline.", "A Hollywood Journey": "Just like any other Tarantino film, Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood is incredibly intriguing. The depth of Quentin's film making never fails to amaze me. He uses every detail to tell the story. This movie is about so much, but the surface is an actor, Rick Dalton, who is struggling to deal with success and live up to what he once was. Rick is most known as a western actor, and as such there are western themes all throughout the film. Many of the most tense scenes and action scenes seem to be structured in western standoff fashion. A lot of the dialogue is the same way. Maybe this is closer to how life was in 1969, the year the movie was set in, but I think it's just a motif especially considering Hollywood is in the west of the United States and the title is basically an homage to the movie \"Once Upon a Time ... in the West\".In westerns there is a certain kind of status of respect that cowboys need to uphold in order to survive or be able to get what they want at least. I think this movie may be comparing this odd social ladder to the social ladder in Hollywood or even just fame in general.In this film we are definitely shown a lot of the actor/Hollywood person experience as well. We see Rick going through all of his struggles as an actor on and off set. On scene and behind the scenes. We see him identifying with his career and thinking he is getting too old and useless as his career comes to an uncertain point. We see him struggling to remember lines as well as giving stunning performances on set. We also see him take note of the fact that the famous Roman Polanski has lived next to him for months and he hasn't yet met him and only ever seen him once. At the end of the film, after going through an incredibly wild night where his house is broken into by hippies who are trying to kill everyone who lives there in a delusional revenge plot, he is finally noticed by his neighbors and invited to meet and talk to them. I think this may be a way of showing how much he had to go through just to get noticed by someone who is in direct proximity both physically and in terms of his field of work.Another part of the Hollywood person experience is portrayed by Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, assistant, and friend. Cliff does a lot of the dirty work on screen in Rick's shows and movies, but he also seems to do a lot of the dirty work off screen as well, like protecting Rick and his wife when the hippies invade his house or fixing his TV antenna when it goes out. Rick has more fame and recognition for his work as he is the face shown in the movies, whereas Cliff is more under the radar even though in a lot of cases he does things very worthy of praise. The film showcases the differences between the Hollywood experiences that these two have. There is as entire scene collection designed specifically to clearly juxtapose their home lifestyles where Cliff drives Rick to his large lavish home in his fancy car and then gets in his own beat up barely running car and drives out to the trailer that he lives in right by a drive-in theater. Rick is practicing his lines in his nice kitchen wearing a robe and making an alcoholic beverage, while Cliff is in his trailer making macaroni and cheese to eat and feeding his highly trained pit bull a disgusting looking canned dog food meal. Cliff and Rick are both standing at their kitchen counter and the shots are clearly designed the same way for comparison.Another look into the Hollywood experience is Roman Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate, who is a starring role in many big movies and in the peak of her career and success. She is incredibly happy, dancing and smiling all the time almost to the point of madness. An interesting part with her is when she goes into a theater to watch some of her films and we see her waiting for the audience's reactions to all of her scene and is incredibly joyous when they react the way the scene was meant to make them react. Sharon's scenes are a look into the pleasure of success and having a very promising future. The fact that Sharon is pregnant at the end of the film might even be a symbol of this success and her future.Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood is a film that allows viewers to see the Hollywood experience by telling a story in a very original (Tarantino) way. The entire movie has an atmosphere, a tone, and structure of a western both in the content of the film and in the way it was created and filmed etc. (on and off set). Definitely a film worth watching. 9/10", "Thank you QT!!!": "I am not usually a Tarantino fan...not at all. However, I wanted to see this movie despite that fact. Pleased to say I am glad I did. Brad was amazing. I loved his character. Leonardo was truly epic. I loved seeing Sharon Tate story being told. Its a slow movie to some...but not to me. I enjoyed getting to know ALL of the characters.I will not spoil the details...but I do wish this movie was true.", "This movie did not deliver": "I say this with reluctance. This movie has a lot happening, but there was so little substance in each thing that happened, it still felt too flat.Things that were great:Acting - Leo and Brad are great actors and their relationship as characters were fun to watch. They both sold their characters for who they are. Rick Dalton is a great character who is afraid to be the has been of TV after failing to break into the silver screen, Leo portrays a great struggle of emotions that you can see he strives to be the best he can. Cliff was the saving grace of this movie, the Stunt double/assistant of Rick who is your guide of Hollywood throughout the movie, taking you through the hills, around the valley, and all the way out to the sticks where the bounty law series was filmed now rundown and overrun by hippies.Style - You get a great sense of the period. I'm glad that they had a decent portion of the movie that just felt like you were back 50 years ago and the characters did ok portraying that time.The Ending - There was a solid 20 minutes of this movie that rang true to Tarantino's style of filming and it was the last sequence of the story. This isn't due to the over the top violence or gore, or even the the crazy (severe spoiler) flamethrower as weapon of choice. I honestly feel it was the only scene that felt like tarantino was there for, like he really put in his time to make that scene awesome and it was very satisfying to watch.Things that weren't great -The story - I feel like there was too much story for this movie that went nowhere. Rick's scared because he's on his downswing, yet is getting praise from his director, his acting companions, and even his agent who literally tells him he's on his downswing. Then he goes to Italy and revives his image more so, when it never felt like he was losing his chops as it is. I didn't feel for Rick, and that he's upset over nothing. Then there's Cliff's story. He befriends a hippie who he picks up and takes her to her commune and has one of the most anticlimactic moments in any movie. Anti climatic isn't bad when done right, but this went nowhere, and it had potential to be so much more than what it was. Sharon Tate was in the movie for a whole 5 minutes, and she only had maybe 10 lines, she could have been omitted from the entire movie and nothing would have changed, it just would have been harder to explain how Manson's family showed up at Rick's door. I know Tarantino added her because of his feelings towards her as an angel on earth, but I feel like her presence was overhyped and unnecessary. I feel like all the characters except Cliff were one dimensional and because of that it felt far too dry.The dialogue - I'm not sure how it happened, but the best dialogue of this movie came from a girl who was supposed to be 8 years old. This actress (or actor for her sake) is super young, but she is going to be in great roles down the line, because she nailed her part. I was ok with with the rest of the dialogue but I do feel like it needed to be reworked, there was no substance to it. There were a few truly amazing lines and some were spot on hilarious, but it was far and few.This movie was ok, but it was an hour longer than it needed to be. I never thought I'd want to walk out of a Tarantino film but it was crossing my mind. I hate that people are going to try and say I just didn't get it. It wasn't hard to get, but it was hard to get into. I will eventually watch it again, but I feel like it's one that I'm going to wait years on. People who say people who don't like this are probably just cgi/fast in the furious fans, the modern audience is going to tear this to shreds are pretentious. I like movies, old and new, but when a movie leaves me feeling like it didn't live to its full potential, I don't feel the need to slobber all over it just because of the names attached to it. In the end, this movie is mediocrity in it's purist form.", "Somewhat disappointing": "I love the vibe and style of this film, but the plot was not very enjoyable. They could have cut out all the parts with sharon Tate since it didn't add anything exiting to the story and have the movie to be at a reasonable length. I loved the bizarre ending however! Very Tarantino which you just gotta love.", "Most disappointing movie in decades": "The feeling I have right now is as if I thought I was purchasing a limited edition box of Lucky Charms filled with nothing but marshmallows, no fillers, but instead it turns out the box is filled with god damn corn flakes.Tarantino, DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie... has to be a top notch film, right? WRONG. So, so wrong. The acting is perfect... the script is garbage. The only thing worse than this awful script is the real life event of what actually happened to Sharon Tate and friends. Maybe Tarantino has lost his touch.", "Stupid ass movie!": "What the hell was the point of Margot Robbie in this movie?? I thought this movie was going to be about her death and it's just about her dancing stupid and feet! Very dumb movie and the acting really sucked for the good actors it had.", "Make Hollywood \"Great\" Again": "Once upon a Time... in Hollywood is a historical-fiction narrative based on the murder of actress Sharon Tate in August 1969 by followers of Charles Manson. The film centers around the fictional Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), a TV actor struggling to maintain his career, and his equally fictional stunt-double/chauffeur Cliff Booth (Pitt). Actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and her husband director Roman Polanski (factual characters) live next door to Dalton, although I would argue that they play secondary roles in this film. The plot constantly weaves between fact and fiction, making it a unique and intriguing tale.\nDiCaprio and Pitt, two of today's most in-demand actors, (although some might argue that they are now past their primes) showcase thoroughly entertaining chemistry throughout the movie. DiCaprio's character is overly sensitive, somewhat inept, and lives a life of luxury in the Hollywood hills, while Pitt plays his signature no-nonsense tough guy, living a slightly less glamorous lifestyle in a mobile home with his dog. Unfortunately, Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate is not explored as much as she could have been. She does not get nearly enough screen time and hardly any lines. The few scenes in which she appears make us believe that the real Sharon Tate was simply a ditsy blonde actress who happened to be married to Roman Polansky.\nThis brings me to one of my biggest complaints of the movie: its depiction of minority populations. Hear me out here. I know some of the more offensive, xenophobic material in this movie is meant to be a parody of the \"old westerns,\" but I feel like some of these \"jokes\" only serve to perpetuate social tensions. The fact that the movie revolves around two fictional caucasian men (in fact, played by two of the most famous real-life ones) while marginalizing Sharon Tate (and in turn, Robbie) seems like a step backward in our day and age. Bruce Lee, a hero and role model for many Chinese Americans and other Asian people, is not displayed in a positive light. The epithet \"beaner\" to describe Mexican people is tossed around, failing to fairly portray the Latinx community. There's hardly any African-American representation. I understand that this movie sets out to recreate the real-life, highly-discriminatory Hollywood of the 1960's, but I feel like the nostalgia-factor combined with the overall disregard for minorities in this film send a message not far from President Trump's slanted \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan.\nThe plot has a strange pace. It's slow, but at the same time maintains momentum. One of the highlights is the seemingly near-perfect replica of the Spahn Ranch, Manson and his followers' make-shift residence which had previously been used for filming old western TV shows such as Bonanza. As far as I have been able to tell from researching online, most of the details of this strange, dystopian hippieville as reproduced in the movie are factual. Tarantino does a great job here evoking a sense of tension looming over the ranch. While this scene in particular peaked my interest, I found other parts of the movie to be comparably dull and insignificant to the greater overarching plot. The movie dragged along with somewhat in-cohesive narration and ended abruptly.\nIn spite of its flaws, this movie serves as an educational (although not completely accurate) depiction of the circumstances surrounding the murders of Sharon Tate and her unborn baby. I had not yet been born when this happened in real life, so it was intriguing for me to watch everything play out. A simple Google search suffices to differentiate between fact and fiction, even though some minute details are up for debate. Besides, its tendency to not be one-hundred percent historically accurate should not be a surprise to anyone who has seen Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. While I loved the concept of this movie, and while it was enticing and thought-provoking, I think it could have been done a little more tastefully by honing in more on Sharon Tate instead of glorifying two random white men who never even existed.The ending was great though.", "Wow amazing": "This is amazing I know that it would be coming in to this because it's by Quentin Tarantino one of the best imo. But man this was great I enjoyed every moment of this movie the film had an amazing story and also an amazing cast and they were all great love Leonardo and brad and Margot they are so talented! That's not even all there's so many good actors/ actresses in this movie such as Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Maya Hawke, Sydney Sweeney, and that's only to name a few I liked. Over all I'd say the story was pretty awesome and cast was great I'd recommend this to anyone who has never watched it !", "Best film to come out in 2019 as of now.": "The acting is completely perfect across the board. The characters are captivating. The dialogue is intriguing. The comedic scenes are hilarious. There is truly nothing bad to say about this film, and you can tell that Tarantino has set very high standards for himself with this one.", "That's a twist": "I truly like the alternative timeline presented. The length of the movie is to its advantage.The movie is a masterpiece in storytelling and visual storytelling.", "1969 at the Playboy Mansion?": "All I know is what I read on Wikipedia. The playboy mansion didn't open until 1971. WTF?\nNo music by the Doors?\nThose hippies sure were despicable characters. They probably should have watched more James Bond movies.", "Great attention to period detail, but what about a story?": "I'm sure Tarantino & team had a great time getting all the period details right, either through sets & props or CGI. But they seemed to have forgotten about the script -- the movie is actually pretty dull.Things pick up toward the end when events & dates begin to converge, but it's slow going to the first 2 hours. Would have been nice to have a more compelling script to go along with the great visual presentation.", "Big Quentin Tarantino Fan!": "I am a Big Quentin Tarantino FAN and have see all of his movies. This by far is the worst, waiting for the plot was like having \"Blue Balls\" and a military float.Hopefully, he'll get back to making classics again!", "Once Upon a (Waste of) Time...": "Another slow paced Q.T. nonsense drama with action glimpses. Same worn up f\u00c3\u00b3rmula... A bunch of characters from start to end that happen to interact and have some kind of connection. Some violent scenes to break the ice. Empty and dumb dialogues that take too long. Ridiculous twist (if we can call it that). Please, stop encouraging overrated directors.", "Tarantino is back on form": "I've been a Tarantino fan since the release of Reservoir Dogs. Fortunately for film lovers the man is a grafter, pushing out films as quickly as he can, for the last few decades. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) he takes a lot of time to make a film, because he writes them too. Some great directors dabble for a while and then once they've made their millions they go on to do something easier, like producing. Fortunately for us Tarantino isn't one of those people.For me Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino back on form. I was disappointed by Hateful Eight and bored by Django. This is his comeback though, showing us why we fell in love with his style of cinema in the first place.Yes, it can be argued that very little happens in the first couple of hours and it all kicks off at the end. Those who feel that way are, in my opinion, missing the point though. Tarantino transports us to a time and place that is obviously close to his heart, and we can't help but fall in love with. It can be argued that he does this in a self indulgent way, but come on, this is Tarantino, we know the drill by now.Opinions are mixed on this film, but for me it's a solid hit.", "It is a time capsule.": "I would rather see this ANY DAY over chicks in tee shirts and jeans shorts YAMMERING ON FOR EVER! This movie gave characters depth,personalities,relationships and experiences. Above all....its a moment in time. Tarantino did the most amazing thing. He gave his version of that summer in CA. I LOVED IT!!! Tarantino told the whole world these so called vicious psychos were cowards and how easily it was to give them what they deserved. He also preserved the innocence the victims,by NOT making them victims. Tarantino is a bad ass.", "Good movie, but slow pacing": "Cinematography: If you loved the 60s era, then you would love the setting/cinematography of this film. Quentin does a great job at capturing that 60s style perfectly through the music, the vehicles, the clothing, the everything. It's pretty perfect in my opinion. In addition, Quentin (at least for the most part) knows whats he's doing in terms of framing and shot selection, but the beginning of this film-aka about the first two hours-was very slow and I think a lot could have been done in editing to condense the whole first part.Acting: The acting was spot on. I thought that all of the lead actors played their characters very well, that was, of course, when the characters actually had dialogue and were able to develop. Like they take tons of resources to cast freakin' Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, but then just show some clips of her laughing in the movie theater and then try to develop her character in the last 15 minutes of the film like it was gonna help. Overall, though, I thought the acting was fantastic, but I guess that's kinda what you'd expect nowadays when going to see a movie starring Leo and Brad.Plot: The plot was slow. Period. When I first heard about the movie, I was pretty excited to see Quentin's take on the Manson case, but it was kinda a mood killer that the plot was so stretched out, and by the end of the film I wasn't crazy interested like I was prior to watching it. I think that the plot overall was strong, but again, the beginning setup of the story was way too spread out and the end felt more like I was doing a Super Mario speed run instead of watching a movie.Takeaways: While it might have seemed like I didn't enjoy this movie based on my previous comments, I truly did like this film when I watched it for the first time. As shown in the past, Quentin likes to take events and sort of alter the endings to be different from the true conclusion. In this case, he sets it up so that the twist is that Sharon Tate doesn't actually get killed like in real life, but instead the Manson attackers end up being murdered. To me, this whole movie is playing on the idea of a \"fairytale\" or \"Hollywood\" ending, but it coming in an unorthodox way. By the end of the movie, you might not say that it is a happy ending, as multiple people were killed/injured, but when compared to the real events, one might say that this twist would be the \"Hollywood\" ending had it actually happened this way.", "Worst Movie Of the Decade": "Being a fan of QT I went with great expectations,anticipating another Django, Inglorious or Pulp Fiction. I ended up being totally disappointed. This is not a movie at all but a Documentary. The Reviewers in all the top Newspapers must belong to an alternate universe because a sizable section of them praised this movie.There is nothing in it to be praised. Just plain, vannila boring Hollywood memorabilia. We see Bruce Lee beaten and thrown against a car (the man has reached mythological proportions) what is the the need to make fun of him. What was the relevance of Bruce Lee being beaten to the movie. Well what was the relevance of every other scene to the other. The movie was disjointed-discontinuous, dull,drab pathetic joke. Is this comedy, or crime or Documentary. Defies classification. I think QT has lost it. Time he took retirement. I want my time and money back. A total waste of both.", "this \"Time\"piece is a bit off": "One must have a connection to the time period to truly enjoy another Tarantino quirkey flick. Decaprio and Pitt eating the scenery and hamming it up was a major plus,the \"who cares anymore\" factor is in the final critique and i do!", "If you like nostalgia then that's about it": "The movie felt just waiting and waiting.. As much as I enjoy Tarantino films and anticipated this movie for long, this movie didn't deliver. One word describes this movie; Nostalgia.\nThe good: Great acting, fantastic humor and good laughs, cinematogrophy, atmosphere (golden age of Hollywood was fabulous) and just overall great feel of that time in America.\nThe bad: the script. It didn't make any sense, left you waiting and bored. Nothing really happens in this movie. I appreciate good writing in movies and this just made no sense, just scene after a scene and no point. That's what made the movie boring because you want something to happen like in Tarantinos movies it usually does, but literally nothing happens until the last 10 minutes. This movie will divide audiences for sure and not everyone will agree with me. Still it was enjoyable but should've been shorter.", "Just an okay film.": "(No spoilers) I was so excited to see this, especially when I heard the rave reviews of how this was Tarantino's finest film, that it showed great maturity, etc. In the end all I can say is that the film had some charming moments, and some good acting (it's difficult for actors to play actors), but ultimately the films just okay. Neither the characters, nor the story were exceptional. I get the plot twist at the end, but that is far too small a device to carry the whole movie, though it seems it was intended to do so. I took my 17 year old son, and he had absolutely no idea about the crime that lurks behind the whole story, so I have ordered the book on the crime for him (two week delay on Amazon, so apparently a lot of people are wanting to learn about it, or revisit it after all these years). I love most everything by Quentin Tarantino, and the combination of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt should have brought us some fantastic scenes, but the story, the film and the acting were just okay.", "Total Crap": "It was a bore throughout almost the entire movie. It lacked substance.", "Just awesome": "ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER.\nHilarious and outstanding ending.", "Quentin Tarantino: Actor, Filmmaker, Illusionist": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood offers very little (if any) concept of plot. The backdrop of the film is set against 1969 Los Angeles, a time where the notorious Manson family rose to infamy. Margot Robbie's almost cameo role in the film as Sharon Tate has been much criticised, for seemingly having no relevance to the plot or overall film whatsoever, but she serves as a vital device in handing the viewer a sense of suspense and plot direction - a vital component of Tarantino's ruse.Anyone with prior knowledge of the Manson family Tate murders can predict where the climax of the film will take us, however in true Tarantino fashion (remember how Inglourious Basterds ends?) the factual course of history is not strictly adhered to. That is not to the say the climax of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood doesn't deliver - it certainly does - it just doesn't deliver exactly how we might've expected.So Tarantino uses this setting and vague plot direction to basically lead on the viewer for two hours while he eulogises about an evolving era in Hollywood. The illusion wouldn't hold up without the performances of DiCaprio and Pitt, who keep us entertained throughout with their day to day struggles and lovable bromance. While Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) has a lot more depth and arc to his character, it is Cliff Booth's scenes that are the most enjoyable and ultimately earn Pitt his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.I enjoyed the irony of Al Pacino's role in the film, as an actor famous for once portraying a character who flees to Italy for refuge, finds himself an Italian wife, and returns stateside having completed his character transformation (Michael Corleone of course). The character of Rick Dalton follows a similar blueprint of success, returning from Italy with a new sense of fashion and comeuppance with the changing times, signifying the completion of his own character arc. There were perhaps more subtle references to the Godfather throughout (14 Fists of McCluskey maybe?) that a cleverer critic than myself may be able to make sense of.While Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isn't Quentin Tarantino's best film, it's certainly worth a watch - even if only for the final 20 minutes or so. It's plot is an ingenious act of illusion, which once realised can only be admired. Overall 7/10.", "Boooooooorring!": "Disappointed. Didn't get it.\nI expected more from Tarantino.", "Self indulgent snoreathon": "Nothing happens. Theres no plot. There really isn't. It's an hour too long I'm total. Every scene is over written. Like someone was scared to edit it because it's Tarantino. I was begging for it to end. Maybe some people who are experts on Hollywood history might get the references but I found the whole thing tipping over into self-indulgence. Not to mention the misogyny. Jesus. Thinly drawn female characters. The female bashing at the end is utterly grotesque. Which is hard to say because it is literally the only action that takes place and you have to sit through three hours of inanity to get there.", "THE WORST TARANTINO'S MOVIE": "DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY AND TIME. WITHOUT SENSE THE WHOLE MOVIE. I FELT THEY STOLE MY MONEY. REALLY REALLY BAD.", "Overindulgent and Laughably Bad": "A truly awful film. Aimless, pointless, turgid, and overindulgent with all of Tarantino's pet obsessions annoying instead of titilating or gleefully shocking the viewer. This time, the Tarantino Tropes are unable to even entertain the viewer.Even the \"best\" parts of this film fall flat. The entire effort lacks any meaningful purpose and lacks onscreen energy. Tarantino is not good enough a writer--or sophisticated enough--to scratch out a poignant character study, which this film attempts to be. It wallows in nostalgia even more than I do when I talk about the DC Comics of my long-dead youth.As a longtime 1965-75 obsessive, I found much to appreciate \"pop culturally speaking\", but even so, that stuff had no business taking up as much of the running time as it did. Such things are better suited to DVD bonus features.Too bad, because I actually liked DiCaprio and Pitt's characters and their performances, as there is lots of \"hang out time\" with these guys. Pitt is especially good here, and his style of cinematic cool has never been more effectively captured on film; I daresay that this is one of his best performances.Pitt even maintains his poise during the embarrassing, \"Family Guy\"-style finale, which is no mean feat when one remembers just how awful and poorly-rendered an ending it is.But the film itself? It leaves a TON to be desired.Young people today seeing \"Once Upon a Time...\" will say \"1969 sure had a lot of lame music, movies, and TV shows!\" It'll confirm their belief that the 1960s was an \"old people's time.\"In fact, \"Once Upon a Time...\" could single-handedly make even the dreaded Baby Boomers question their 1960s acid-flashback memories and even make those go sour.The film is topped off by a comically-bad, poorly-acted, and just plain dumb finale--think \"Family Guy\"; I'm not kidding. It's just embarrassing.My rating 3/10", "Deserve 1 Star": "I give this move 5 star because of Leonardo DiCaprio,Brad Pitt,Al Pacino. Otherwise deserve 1 star", "This movie is ridiculous, but you always get that classical Tarantino ending that gives you a laugh": "We already know that Tarantino is one of the craziest directors in Hollywood. I was really excited and anxious to watch this movie, as two of my favorite actors (Leonardo Dicaprio and Brad Pitt) were back at the big screen for a promising adventure.\nThe beginning and development of the movie is as many of Tarantino's movies. A slow and random way to introduce the screenplay, making it to be an odd movie for a guy like Tarantino. Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are interesting characters, but they didn't achieve their potential as they weren't able to attach themselves to a strict and clear story. Of course there is no question that DiCaprio and Pitt did a nice job, because when it takes to play the role of a guy that is constantly smoking and getting drunk, no matter what they do for living, there ain't much better guys to do it.\nAnother thing I didn't understand at all was Margot Robbie's role in this picture. Never understood why she got there, at first place, and what is the meaning and importance of her character for the plot. That was a vague question left in the air, due to the fact we all knew already who Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth were, but no one had a clue who Sharon Tate was.\nThe ending is the classical Tarantino ending. The plot twist makes get interested for a while, with a lot of violence and backlash. Still, it's not enough to cover a confusing and boring screenplay.\nThis could have been a better Tarantino work in my opinion...", "A TV movie documentary starring Brad Pitt & Leo Di Caprio": "Loved the Hollywood setting and the feeling of being transported to the era of the Hollywood of yesteryear. Brad Pitt clearly outshines everyone in this film. No clue what Robbie was doing in this movie, that role could have been played by anyone as it Tate's storyline truly had no weight in the film. It's an uber expensive mishmash, a lot of the language and jokes are old man jokes and it felt simply like it was trying too hard to be hip. I almost fell asleep at a moment, which has only happened once before in my life. As a massive Tarantino fan, it's sad to see the master lose his grip. Maybe he should stop listening to all the Yes-men around him and get himself a few No-men of a younger generation to put him back in touch with the world around him.", "Thumbs up from this chick ..": "Loved a lot about this movie, the whole 60s SoCal thing, had me smiling, being a kid and living in California, loved seeing all the nostalgia. Was nice to see Leo and Brad, together, being funny, always liked Leo, now a Brad fan. It was a tad long, and at times seemed to go in too many directions, but all in all a cute little movie, and the\nmusic was great!The end made me a little sad...what if...what if...", "Good movie with one huge flaw": "This movie is pretty, has good dialogue, takes its time, sets a scene, characters have an arc and is overall entertaining, even if some might say not a lot happens.However there is one critical oversight. If you are not familiar with Sharon Tate and the Manson family you will not \"get\" this movie fully. A history I didn't realize I had to be familiar with before I saw this movie.You won't get why Leo is in a movie in the movies reality (which was originally not Leo) while Margot Robbie is in a cinema \"pretending\" to be someone in a movie she wants to see, she's not digitally placed in it, so she must be pretending to be the actress in said movie. Once the movie is finished you'll think that Margot's entire character was better left on the cutting floor to speed the pace up, missing the point completely that she was the main plot thread.The tension in one of Brad Pitts scenes comes across as something clearly isn't right, yet as a viewer you will not fully grasp why exactly this scene is tense.Charles Manson makes an appearance, as a viewer you'll think \"Ok, a cameo by someone famous, I don't know who this is, fair enough\". While it was Manson meeting Sharon Tate, a big deal and to people in the know a creepy wow moment.There are other examples but I've made my point. This movie appears to be about Leo and Brad's character finding their groove back in the Hollywood movie industry, but it really isn't, the main plot in the movie revolves around Sharon Tate seen through snippets in the other characters world.This movie could have been an 8/10. I'm now familiar with the history behind the movie. I wasn't however when I first saw the movie and I can't experience it again as a first viewing now that I know. That's disappointing and for this critical oversight im giving this movie 6/10.", "Good actors but horrible story line": "Very disappointed I watched this hoping it would get better.

I will not give away anything, but this movie is a fun ride!", "Didn't like it": "I usually really like Tarantino movies so maybe I was expecting too much. The idea of the movie itself was great but the movie fell well short.", "Not the best but still cool!.": "Good ideas , good payoffs , im a gigantic tarantino fan!. Some complained about this one - my only complaint may be that it is too long.", "I up may rating a little bit for Rick and Morty easter egg.": "And awaaaay we go! Not spoiling the film but did Tarantino give a nod to Rick and Morty and clue to his twist at end of Once upon a time in Hollywood? OK 1st EVER reddit post btw. Watched film other night and then heard Pitt quoted Rick from Rickie in Time, as the films twist links to concept of episode touch\u00c3\u00a9 Quentin.Got to give it to him with hidden nods and attention to details really...", "What is this movie trying to say?": "After seeing the high rating of this movie and reading that it is based on a true story but with a positive ending I got very excited to watch it. Even the TITLE of the movie draws you in. The movie is very well shot and has nice sceneries. But I was very confused regarding what this movie was about..\nit was sooo slooooowww and nothing was happening until the last 20 minutes...\nSome of the characters were so dull that they didn't exactly add anything to this movie besides runtime. I mean, what exactly was the point of including characters such as Sharon Tate and Polanski? How exactly did they enhance the story? If you completely omit them then this movie is just about the same without them. Why did we have to follow Sharon Tate from the airport all the way home and watch her walking in the street and watching a movie and dancing in her room and going to a restaurant and all that? Honestly, I ADMIRE MARGOT ROBBIE; if not for her, then I would've been bored watching the character she played, but doesn't change the fact that this character was completely useless since she wasn't killed/approached/touched/hurt as in the real story behind this movie. She (and Polanski) didn't even interact with the main characters until the very end of the movie.\nI did indeed enjoy watching Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt! Their acting is brilliant and the characters they played are well-constructed and developed.\nI can't submit this review without mentioning the amazing Julia Butters!!! Such a talented, young actress!!!! Her character (Trudi) is probably my favorite in this movie!", "Good...not great": "You spend 3 hours waiting for something to happen...and then the pay off is worth it. Some great acting, some great scenes, must not a full three hours worth. This should have been trimmed to about 2 hours and it would have been much better.", "One of Quentin Tarantino's weaker movies. Barely feels like a Quentin Tarantino movie.": "I loved Leonardo Discaprio and Brad Pitt in this movie. They are both probably the best part of the movie, along with the third act.The plot was probably the worst part of this movie, not saying it's awful, just the worst part of the movie. Really bloated and disconbobulated. Most Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate scenes were pretty pointless in terms of plot. She also barely says anything or barely even acts. Why hire such a big named actress just for that? But some her scenes are oddly touching. I get where Quentin was going for with her, trying humanize her to make us feel even worse because we know her dark fate, then he subverts our expectations at the end by not killing her. So that again makes her scenes kinda pointless.There's a very long scene of Brad Pitt driving a hippie girl to her home, then him wanting to talk to a person there who he used to know. And why are all the hippies so mad at Brad Pitt's character for wanting to talk to George? It seems Quentin Tarantino was just trying to subervt expectations just for the sake of it, cuz he built it up as if they killed him or something, but actually nothing happened and he's fine. So why are they so mad at Brad Pitt for this? Don't get me wrong, this scene is probably one of the best of the movie just for the suspense, but still, what was the point of this scene? Maybe just to build up the main killer who shows up again at the random ending? Still not justified enough for me. I also understand it's based on a similar situation that happened in real life, but that still doesn't excuse that's it's pointless in context of the movie itself.Most people are saying the last 10-20 minutes of the movie is the best part. I do agree it's very entertaining, but it's kinda random in terms of the actual plot of the movie. I understand this is a spin on the real life Manson murders, but that still doesn't excuse it's inconsistency with the rest of the plot. There was no build up to this, but it's still entertaining AF.Aside from that, you get a lot of talking on movie/TV show sets and driving around Los Angeles in the 60s. It's slow and not for everyone, but I personally enjoyed most these scenes, and just seeing 60s LA, etc. Most of this talking isn't Tarentino's classic high quality dialogue though. The dialogue in most other Tarantino movies is MILES BETTER, some of the most classic and quotable movie dialogue I've ever heard in my life, but still some great dialogue and acting in this movie. I actually forgot this is a Quentin Tarantino movie cuz it doesn't feel like one. For the most part, it feels like a basic movie that could've been directed or written by anyone. Aside from the over-the-top violent ending, that was classic Tarantino.Overall, definitely one of Tarantino's weaker movies, but I was still entertained most the movie, even the slower scenes. I just hope this isn't Quentin's last movie, because I know he can do way better than this. I hope he does a horror movie for his last movie, because that final scene was so amazing.", "Utterly disappointing and a waste of money and time": "The new Tarantino movie was utterly disappointing. 3 hours of pain to endure a rather disconnected plot with no real action or an interesting story to be followed. The last 30 minutes portrayed some excessive, over the top and oddly satisfying violent scenes but that was all. I think that those rating this movie with 5/5 are simply echoing how people's bar is so low these days. Definitely a no-go.", "Lots of feet and shoes!": "Lots of feet and shoes! Brilliant acting but disappointing", "A Fairy Tale we can all appreciate.": "I came across a very very decent review that mentioned,\" this film is not for everyone..\" and I believe that proves true with this film. The same can be said for almost all Quentin Tarantino's film's. You either see the humor or you don't. You either think they are classics or you don't. You think it's too violent or you don't, and again I think that proves to be the case with Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. As the film begins you are dropped into the world of Hollywood in 1969 and all that that involves. Hippies, drugs, actors and actresses, beautiful sets and images of L.A., movie sets and cameras, and of course lots of cigarettes. But the magic with Tarantino is he shows you just how extraordinary the ordinary can be be even when he has super star Hollywood A list members portraying complex characters. Leo is incredible and brings the same star power he oozed with in \"Wolf of Wall Street\" and that star power never goes dim through the almost three hour film. Brad Pitt was the hero we all deserved and the one we needed And reveals just how magical the actor can be given any type character just like he has throughout his career. What can't be said of Margot Robbie and her Almost literal becoming of the late Sharron Tate. Robbie is truly a student of the game and profession of acting, she brings Mrs. Tate to life again. It's a movie you have to watch to understand why it's so special and of course even involving the manson family murders is incredibly shaky ground, but the way Tarantino ends the film is truly a classy and an even noble way to end a film with the specific context. Simply put this is a story about,\" what if the the fairy tale did exist? What if the bad guy Didn't win?\"", "Tarantino's done it again!": "Amazing performances, funny, fast paced and truly Tarantino styled", "Wow!": "Before seeing the movie I had some reservations. I've already seen The Hateful Eight, Inglorious Basterds snd Pulp Fiction so I was ready for \"a Tarantino Film\" (blood and gore), but Once Upon A Time surprised me. I thoroughly enjoyed it, the interaction between Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio was convincing and natural, the entire cast was great, the plot turns were awesome and surprising and the finish - that was GREAT!!! Glad to have seen it - and kudos to Tarantino for an excellent production!", "If Tarantino hadn't directed this it would have a 4/10 rating": "This film fails in the fundamental aspect of cinema - to have a plot.'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' does not have a plot.It is simply a succession of events of no particular interest, or relevance, squashed together.The only thing in the film vaguely resembling a plot - I won't reveal what - happens briefly halfway through for around 20 minutes and then pops-up again for the final 10 minutes. What is the point of the other 2+ hours, I have no idea.If anyone other than Tarantino had directed this, it would've been panned. Yet, as it's him, it receives this utterly unjustifiable rating.Perhaps this is actually an art installation by Tarantino; Tarantino proves he can receive copious plaudits by squashing a load of 'stuff' together and calling it a film.I would say that some have lost the plot by approving of this film. But there is no plot to lose.No plot, no point.", "I've seen it about 4 times and every time was better that the last!": "Quite possibly my favorite movie of all time along side The Truman Show. Quentin Tarantino is at the top of his game here, rivaling Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Some may say the movie just drags on and on until the end, which is completely understandable. I see it differently I see the whole movie as a build up and background to the ending, which by the way is spectacular. This amazes me every time I watch it. I can't say enough about it. The last scene is spectacularly unexpected, wild, and hilarious. It is also a beautiful way to end it by erasing a horrible tragedy and giving the story a happy ending. This shows the story of Sharon Tate's murder from Quentin Tarantino's unique perspective and film style. Tarantino never disappoints and that stays true with this film. I can't say enough about the ending and the movie as a whole. It is a wonderful, hilarious, epic piece of story telling. 10/10 every time I watch.", "One of the worst tarrantino films ever.": "No storyline. Boring. After one hour, I was wondering when it would end. Acting is good. The rest was a fail. I've no idea how it has received any good ratings.", "Brad Pitt superstar": "I always enjoy the way Tarantino gets amazing stuff from actors and the whole general air of his films. OUATIH does not disappoint. Don't like Dicaprio, but Brad Pitt is a delight here.", "Better than I Expected": "After reading some of the negative reviews on IMDB, I almost did not take the time to watch this one. That would have been a mistake. I suspect that a major factor in the way people see this film depends on their age and how much they know about the history of Hollywood and the TV shows and films of the 60's. There was a certain swagger in those times - and this film captured it. Younger viewers may not see the point of many of the scenes - they may not \"get it\". I also enjoyed the way the film played with the main characters - Rick played tough guys on the screen - but Cliff really was the tough guy. The twist at the end was great - caught me completely by surprise. But after all - the title is: \"Once upon a Time ... in Hollywood\".", "A movie that feels like a movie": "This is a proper Hollywood film, in the sense of its topic, the production and the cast. It's an enjoyable movie about movies, and surprisingly the 2 hour 40 minute runtime didn't feel like it dragged for me.The main issue is that the plot is microscopic compared to the production - there is no part of the plot that needs all that production for. The story is fun to follow along but when it comes to a climax it feels slightly underwhelming. The storylines of different characters do eventually tie in but so tentatively which is a shame to see when Tarantino has done this so well in his other films like Inglorious Basterds or Pulp Fiction.Brad Pitt plays Brad Pitt so he gets insufferable at some points, certainly not a deserved Oscar winner for this. Di Caprio is great in it but it's a film that's right up his street so there's no surprise there. I wish Margot Robbie received more screen time, her character shows a lot of promise but doesn't have a real arc or depth, which is strange seeing as she's a selling point of the movie.Tarantino's movie is fun to watch, I would throw the word 'overrated' around though. It's more fun when you don't look into it too much.", "Just no..": "This is just another Manson movie, if you have seen the movies about that night already then you don't miss much, the only difference probably is the money they threw at it. Of course Leonardo and Brad did a great job even when I didn't really loved their part of their story, it's like it just didn't fit even though that was the whole point.\nThe message behind the movie was supposed to be that they struggle because they're actors? Meh\nSeriously the only point of that story was Sharon Tate and I can't even say that Margot did a great job because all she would do was smile during the whole movie. I didn't know that was called acting.\nBad movie, bad story line, I had such high hopes for this movie and it was just meh!!\nIf they would've done the story about Sharon Tate then maybe it would've been better and more entertaining (just with a better actress)", "worst movie ever!!!": "Really I just left the theater. Boring. Really boring. Waste of my money. I expected more from the producer and actors.", "A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!!": "If it was not for Leonardo Dicaprio whose performance was magneficent it would get a 2.

Disappointment.I would not go to the movie just for this kinda flat storyline.Acting was good but they big names.", "why is margot robbie here": "Boring, boring, and long film, a lot of this film can be removed and nothing will change, the beginning is calm and drawn out, the first half of the film is nothing of itself, the film is divided by two main characters, at first about one, then about the other, I liked the moments with girl actresses, hippies could be removed, but without them there would not have been such a fun ending, why is Margot Robbie here, the acting is good, the music and sound in this film are excellent, the editing and the shooting itself are magnificent, this is the second film that I watch from Quentin and this is the second film that is weak in my opinion.", "WTF - without the A grade cast would be B grade at best": "Pretty terrible. No real plot. The whole Margot Robbie line was a complete waste of time. Only Brad Pitt and Leo could have pulled it off to be something watchable", "Yet another great Tarantino film": "This is a story about 2 actor and stuntman in Hollywood that has to do this what went on in Hollywood in the 60s. Their is a lot of history that you may think you have to know but you really don't if your like me you enjoy movies that teach you things like this you will enjoy ir. At times it can be slow but overall it's a good pace and aloof things happen in this film. The performance by the 2 actor's are great you really get to feel what they are feeling. You see tiger lives you see what's happening in Hollywood . This isn't a typical Tarantino film you could say but you could tell it is because as usual it's directed buetifuly and the dialogue is great. Their is tarintino violence but bit that much. Thatsallyou need to know this movie is great and not a top 5 Tarantinofilm but great that's for sure", "Top 3": "Before I watch the movie, I thought it would be the representation of the original storie about Manson's family mueders, but the most amazing thing of this movie it's how Tarantino plays with the \"What if...\" , Just as the title and in like a fairytale (as Sharon Tate used to live in 60's Hollywood before she was killed), Tarantino representantes how little coincidences can re-write history.\nIt is not a movie for everybody, you need some previous knowledge about history and Cinema, in general terms. May not be his best movie, but it is definitely a Best Picture, Best original Script, Best actor and Best director Nominee for the Oscar's.", "Tarantino's best movie yet!": "Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth was awesome and leonardo DiCaprio was the perfect choice for Rick Dalton. The movie has a great plot, an ultra violent ending and pays respect to the victims of the Manson family killings.", "Tarantino did it again!": "Tarantino is Tarantino, if you liked his work till now than, for sure you will love this movie!", "Acting lesson": "The finest acting you'll ever see on film. Brad Pitt has always been strongly underrated for his acting ability, but he can't be denied here.And Leonardo Di Caprio.. just wow.. the greatest actor of a generation, if not all.Acting, comedy, satire, storyline, script, everything about this movie is amazing, and a rare gem in a sea of modern dross driven by special effects.10/10.", "Great Tarantino Style Movie": "Absolutely great Tarantino movie. The cast was brilliant and the story was complete and interesting.I liked what I saw.", "No plot but still fun to watch...": "There is no twist or plot but just great acting and cinematography...", "Tarantino's Daring Film": "What Tarantino's film does right is his sense of direction, knowing how to put just the right elements (comedy, suspense, friendship, history, and even a narrator) to tell a story. In this case, it's the story of Rick and Cliff (an actor and his double), and their tales.First and foremost, the argument of the hippies is put on place very early on with Cliff (Brad Pitt) blinking an eye on a hippie girl. By the way, we aren't really seeing the bright side of them: they are depicted as a malevolous community capable of doing the worst, such as murder and of having an extreme ideology that doesn't really make much sense.Along the scheme of the film, we might find this somewhat long \"fillers\", that lasted a few minutes each, where we see a single character, not speaking anything but merely driving, to go to another destination. To think of these as mere fillers is a mistake; we have this scenes to put the whole ambient of the 60's in just one piece, using the most important tool: music. That's their whole reason of existence, and while I understand the logic, I feel like sometimes it was too much of it, or too repetitive, perhaps it should have been done only at the beginning. In my opinion, this could have been removed to reduce the duration and it would still be great. This aspect was kind of reminiscent of Mussorsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, where we have the walk, Promenade, which represents the moment of going from one picture to another. In a similar way in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, we have this Promenades that gives you time to breathe between each section of the movie.The comedy aspect of the movie was fine. It delivered all of the exceptions, with Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, it just can never go wrong. Even in the way they spoke and not doing explicitly jokes, the way each other related, was full of good-measured humor and very enjoyable.Moments of tension are also really, really tense. I mean, for real. The scene where Cliff walks into a hippy community in a ranch, (where they live together without shoes and almost in an undeniable animal-state), and goes to visit an old friend of his, George, very strange things begin to happen. The hippies are secretive and evidently trying to hide something, and George is delusional, blind, his memory fails. Other things like a rat's sound in a filthy house makes the whole thing scary and weird, as if examining a dead body kind of weird, mixed with a frightening violin melodyThe different characters do a splending job in setting their own unique personality, and do it in a very relatable manner. We see a hippy girl, a Kung Fu fighter with too much pride, an intelectual girl that likes reading and is 8 years old.\nThe Polanski's (Rick's neighbors) failed to convince me, there just was something about both of them that I just didn't grasp or understand, and lacked potential to make the story even greater. Perhaps it was because they didn't really relate to Rick and Cliff's arch, until the very end, and they were there, almost filling a gap, their story a bit too independent of our two protagonists.The changing of filming style between different sections of the movie is what made a film that otherwise would be \"two guys into the sixties\" into \"all the colors and the very essence of the sixties, oh and by the way, the story of two guys\", make a lot of sense. What I mean by this is that sometimes they used scary instrumental music from old films into a part of the movie, the actually black and white parts where Rick is recalling his past movies (and make it look genuine), a sudden narrator in the middle of the movie (which didn't last too long), and among other things, made it very enjoyable. It felt like watching a collage-like movie, or having a box of chocolates with different surprises.Le Grand Finale was flawless and one daring move, that was being prepared before, with the hippie's tension scary, dark and disgusting side set into motion: we see a f*king war veteran torture to hell the crazy hippie guys and their ridiculous extremism. Even when Cliff was so gone and out of himself because of spolier: drugs, it felt like he was fighting an ant there. What we might have seen in an horror movie as a terrible, almost gore scene, it was depicted in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as a humorous sadism, where one just can't avoid to explode into laughter.", "I really looked forward to seeing this movie...": "Wow, this movie was such an incredible letdown. I was really looking forward to seeing this film. For the life of me, I don't know what movie most of the people rating this with 10's was watching. This was one of the most boring, lifeless storylines I have witnessed in a long while. The movie went absolutely nowhere with the storyline (if there really was a storyline). I almost walked out, but instead just fought really hard to keep mt eyes open.There is nothing to spoil by reviewing this movie. There was little to no story or plot until the last 5 minutes of the movie. Save your money.", "Senseless, stupid documentary": "This has got to be one among the most stupid documentary with half baked truths and lies - and it nowhere deserves to be called as a movie.\nTarantino - a thing of past.", "Worst movie I have seen in over a decade.": "There is nothing else to say other than it was terrible. This was the first movie I have said was terrible in my life. I mean with most movies I can find some good or what the movie was trying to accomplish; with this movie, it was literally a pain to even have on the TV. No excitement, zero plot.", "Great Acting, but...": "This film has three of my all time favorite actors, Brad, Leo, and Margot. The performances by all three and everyone else in the film are outstanding! It does a great job at bringing you back in time and showing you into the the world of actors and stunt doubles. This is a must buy for myself when it comes out. However with all the great things being said the story is for the most part non existence with this being more of a look inside an actors life... no major plot whatsoever... though I walk away a fan of the film with the ending bringing a smile to my face, my wife was not so pleased... being we're both huge movie buffs and actually meeting in acting school, we both agreed the performances were flawless with a weak storyline that she did not enjoy as much as I. This movie is definitely worth a watch, but depending on what you look for in films may not be for everyone.", "Supply your own headline...": "When I watch a Tarantino movie, I expect to see obsession. I expect to see tribute paid to days past. I expect to see a cast of characters that has built over time based on (what I believe to be) the relationship he has built with the characters in past films. I expect to hear music that would be lost on most, to be discovered by new listeners. I also expect to find a jewel or three that I could not predict in advance.I looked for things that were out of place in the film. Possibly only the livery on the 747's was wrong. The cars, the styles, the movie placards were as expected --- right! I spotted familiar characters from the past, and hope that Brad Pitt will be included as a cast member in the future, as he did an outstanding job. I was disappointed that Zoe Bell only appeared in one scene. She is forever etched in my mind, and only QT brings out the best in her. I expected Pitt and DiCaprio to be outstanding...they always are. I didn't hear as much older music as I would have liked, but it does have to fit into the movie rather than have the movie play to the music.I could ramble forever, and I won't. The first thing that really stood out in this movie for me was the scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio and Julia Butters. DiCaprio is awesome as expected, but Julia Butters was unexpectedly amazing for her age. She showed depth that was completely unexpected for a 10-year old girl...maybe only 8 or 9 when the filming was done. If reality doesn't destroy her desire to act, she has great potential.The second jewel was the alternate reality of the last part of the movie. As soon as I saw the street sign early in the movie that said Cielo Drive, my expectations were set. I was completely ready for what I knew was to happen, only to be surprised by a turn into an alternate reality. If only the alternate version could have been the real one, it would have only been a story in the LA papers for a few days rather than a mystery that continued to play out for nearly 50 years.", "Hail, Caesar! it is not.": "25 years ago, I sat in a midnight showing anxiously awaiting the first screening of Pulp Fiction. We all know how that played out. So, my excitement was peak Tarantino going into this screening of Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood. Let's just get this done straight away: Tarantino got a little to wrapped up in trying to be 'Tarantino-like'. This was a dud. From beginning to 30 minutes prior to ending. Hail, Caesar! was far more entertaining, with better acting, and far superior comedy. The Charlie Manson stuff was completely unnecessary and did not move the 'story' (whatever the hell the intent was there...???), it moved (or will move) ticket sales. Complete disappointment.", "Tarratino needs to stop making movies": "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood a washed up director chose to re-write history by beating up women, racially belittling an Asian legendary figure and padding a plot less film with actors driving around listening to music.

Seeing it ones is enough. Q.T. have done way better movies.", "Once Upon a Time... in (the) West Hollywood": "From reading other reviews it seems I made a big mistake walking out of this movie after only maybe 2 hours of mind numbing time travel. Slaughter-House\nFive did it much better and with less hype. Honestly, in all my years of avid, but critical movie watching I never thought I would have to endure 2 hours of\nself-indulgent, dis-jointed mish-mash in hopes that the ending would make it all worth-while. I'll admit I happily drank the Tarantino Kool-Aid after watching T.R, R.D. P.F. and K.B. but this last (burnt) offering left a bad taste in my mouth. I've been watching Once Upon a Time in the West by S. Leone before Hollywood came out and I noticed at least three references that Tarantino has made use of in the above movies mentioned. With Hollywood now it's four. Seriously, watch Leone's West for a better appreciation of Tarantino and to learn how a super long movie can keep you in your seat because you want to be there all the way to an ending that doesn't need to justify what came before. The sheer beauty and humanism of the ending stands in sharp contrast to what came before. Teach yourself to be critical. It's okay to criticize the great Q.T.. Really it is. Again for a better appreciation of Tarantino watch Leone's West , La Dolce Vita, and My Life to Live. Especially the last - you'll be amazed. And I promise I'll see the ending of Hollywood when the DVD comes out to see what everyone else is so gaga about.", "Hard on women": "Tarentino can't resist brutally murdering a couple women in the last act, one by Brad Pitt smashing her head to bits, and one by Leonardo with a flamethrower.

Even Tarantinos trademark over the top violence was completely toned down in this movie with barely a drop of blood in it.This movie is factually inaccurate senselessly random rubbish that points to a director who has past his best before date.

That it's mediocre. And for me, this is where this one sits.

I was waiting for the pay-off in the second half of the film, and sadly it didn't really come - what's lacking here is a really carefully thought through plot line, where something actually happens.The film takes another interesting 'alternative history' approach, such as in (the much superior) Inglorious Basterds, which could have been really interesting, but doesn't really do a lot with it. I suspect if you weren't at least somewhat familiar with the story of Sharon Tate the movie would make even less sense (and be even less interesting).It's still better than 90% of the films released in 2019, but we expect so much more of QT, that it feels a bit of a letdown.

With all the colors and classic cars and half true - half alternative universe. I personally love the late 60's and early 70's environment so this section wasn't all about waiting for something to happen for me. It was a real life theme park for me.By the time I watch the fancy colors section (and mostly when I see the cultists) I suddenly realized that at the end of the film, the cult is going to murder the Polanski family. Every hour passed, every scene I see Sharon, I said to myself that \"Ah damn, he is going to die and people's life will get messed up\". So the environment for me was a little bit thrilling. Little bit but rises exponentially.After the fight scene, I was so happy that they did not die. At least we can make Sharon live at the film. That is what matters. I can tell someone would say it is not realistic and it ruined everything because she lived. At the films we can bend the reality to whatever we like. Why do we even watch movies sometime? We as humans need to get out our minds from reality sometime. That is why we dream. Thank you for the good dreams Tarantino.", "One of my Tarantino picks": "Get all the top actors together, throw in a great script and get Tarantino to cook it and Vee-OH-laaa! Perfectly put together with interesting characters, brilliant acting topped off with a climactic finale that will have you applauding with acceptation. Definitely worthy of a mention at the awards and wouldn't be surprised I they took some home.", "Deserve more!": "This movie is one of the best i've watched in the last few years ( if you love the 60's and 70's and the music, life style and other stuff of these years you will love this movie ), it's a Tarantino's movie so... you can expect many things made by him , i'm not sure if i'd say if this one could be in the top of Tarantino's films.", "Hollywood, 1969": "An incredible film, with great performances and a very good screenplay.\nThe final, when Brandy and Cliff kill the hippies, is one of the best climax in a movie, last years.\nPD: The change of the history make that I remember Inglorious Basterds!", "Dreadful": "Nothing happens.\nNo story, no plot, nothing.\nWaste of time. Last 10 mins are good but that's it.\nDo yourself a favour and give this a miss.", "It's a fun time, but nothing iconic.": "Great cinematography, we haven't seen such thing done in so long. Brad Pitt's performance was phenomenal. Not a single scene was boring, Tarantino has done a great job as always. Overall, it's a fun time, but nothing iconic that stays with you.", "Quentin Tarantino at his best": "Tarantino was long-winded ONLY when it actually made sense - to draw out suspense and create intense mood. The dialogue didn't go on and on and on as it does in some of his movies. The acting was great as were the period set elements. Sometimes he's so stylized that I feel completely removed from the story emotionally, but not in this case. This one actually made me feel. This movie is Tarantino at his best!", "Not for nothing, not a waste of 2.5 hours b": "It was an average Tarintino movie, with a pinch of Hollywood history and humor. DiCaprio was unlikable. The Manson family had their moments of unnerving creepiness. All in all it a waste of time. Big time bore.", "Reminded me of Jackie Brown": "Saw this on a flight to the USA, having got used to QTs gory style, this one seemed closer to the style of Jackie Brown. Solid story of Hollywood life, good supporting cast - two stories in one really. The film ended is a more recent QT style with plenty of gore and a nice flamethrower for added value.Not his best work, but still good.", "Extremely bad": "This is surely Tarantino's worst film. There are many flaws in this picture including the existence of margot robbie's character. I mean why was she even put in this film? She had absolutely no role whatsoever.\nWe all know Tarantino Likes to put action scenes in his movies but why put them if it doesn't make any sense? Through the middle I started wondering what was happening in the movie. When showing multiple scenes at a time you don't need to show every step", "People haven't really understood the content and the context of this movie at all..": "Tarantino has a fan base, not because, he is a pioneer in violent cinema, but because he is an expert proponent of the dark side of human beings, and how that side emerges and is the very definition of the society we live in.\nIn the climax of OUATIH, we see Rick Dalton, getting invited for a drink minutes later he burns a hippie via his flame thrower! It is ironic as well as derivative how Tarantino deals with the society we live in, where the rich and powerful sit in high prizey dinner tables after doing mass genocides.\nOUATIH is a masterpiece at many levels. On the surface level, it shows humorously the relationship between an actor and his stunt man, and a wife of a famous director who got lost in the charms of Hollywood.\nRick Dalton wants recognition as an actor, where Hollywood typecasts him. Cliff needs to do something for survival. And Sharon is faking her life inside rich playboy mansions and the actor in her is lost behind the identity of her husband. Tarantino fascinates in showcasing loneliness of the leads in a sarcastic manner.\nThe movie has cross cultural reference to the kind of times and movies that Hollywood of those times believed in. Loud, spaghetti Westerns, violence laden, angry mob cinema at its peak those days, whereas women are mostly sexualised for glamour. Rich poor divide showcased via hippies who wanted to kill the upper elite one fine night, ending up getting killed themselves.\nThe last 45 minutes is quintessential Tarantino at his best. Again on surface value it will appear to you it's another Tarantinos love for gore and violence climax. But Tarantino really outshone himself as he blurred the lines between protagonists and antagonists in the movie. The hippies who came to ambush the Dalton's! Were they really the bad guy? Or the main cast who killed those hippies brutally? What is the reason for this societal divide? Why people get away being so violent in this society? That's what really Tarantino establishes here.\nLeonardo was very good. Brad Pitt really surprised me. AL Pacino still holds the magic of screen presence and rest all are fine. Must watch!!", "Not Tarantino's Masterpiece but a Fantastic Film": "I enjoy Tarantino's filmmaking style, the way he uses real life dialogue within scenes along with his attention to detail in every scene is fantastic. This movie stays true to that filmmaking style. Within this movie I felt as though I was living in the late 1960's from the clothing, to the music, the vehicles, the characters, everything drug me into the time period. The acting as well as how the scenes were presented were also fantastic, I felt as though many times I was actually there in the scene itself. Though Brad Pitt's performance was excellent and earned him the Supporting Actor Oscar I felt as though DiCaprio's performance was what made the movie. I enjoyed his portrayal of Rick Dalton. The way he had to act a \"movie within a movie\" in many scenes was superb and a fantastic performance again from DiCaprio. The positives being the writing, acting and scene portrayals there was a negative to the film. The main negative is the plot of the movie seemed a little lacking in parts compared to other Tarantino films. It seemed to have a slower pace as the majority of the movie was more of a documentary of Rick Dalton's life then the final bit being more of the typical Tarantino climatic story. Due to this the movie did seem a bit long winded. This film is not for everyone, it definitely is geared more toward people who enjoy the 1960's era, the Hollywood lifestyle, the background of filmmaking and Tarantino's style of film. This film is far from a masterpiece from Tarantino, it isn't an \"Inglorious Basterds\" or \"Django Unchained\" or even a \"Pulp Fiction\" but it is still a fantastic film that I would recommend everyone give at least one run through.", "Great acting, style, cinematography...very lacking in other areas": "I really wanted to like this more. Beautful photography! Mixing and matching genres: comedy, western, spaghetti western, thriller etc. Fun story set-ups. Great acting!But then the problems starts. I saw another review that would describe Tarantino's \"hubris\" when writing this. For many die-hard Tarantino fans, everything he does is ballsy and edgy. But to me, as the minutes became hours, I felt that this was just an ensemble cast gathered to \"subvert...subervert...subvert\". Yes, he plays with genres but that has been done elsewhere, such as Westworld. Ultimately Tarantono just strings together several stories, leading up to the requisite bloodbath at the end. The Dicaprio story was interesting, the rest kind of went nowhere. Cliff does this contrived trip to the ranch to come upon Manson's minions, pokes the bear for no particular reason, even when it is clear the old man basically knows what's happening. This then leads to the randon encounter next door, where history can be rewritten to erase the Manson family's major murder spree. First, younger audiences won't get it, second what is the point of undoing this Hollywood event that sort of redefined us as a nation and how we see the modern age. Let's throw that out the window so we can have a big violent brawl! Maybe in part II the friends can travel back in time to get Hitler!Beyond this, there really is a lot of establishment anger to 60's/70's counterculture here. The \"old timey\" folks who act in the traditional shows are the \"good guys\" but the counter-culture \"hippies\" are treated with contempt throughout the film. And then the \"good guys\" change history by a random event just thrown in their laps - as Cliff conveniently runs into this girl numerous times and she happens to be Manson family. No particularly positive examples of the hippie movement, just right to the murderers who are disdained before they even commit a murder. For someone wo so likes subverting genres and expectations, why does Tarantino have such rage against a group that was 99% peaceful.So much of the film is built on contrived circumstance. The one character is called pussycat and Brad Pitt is given the easy set up: We all love p*ssy...yes we do. So, so classy.To me this was a macho film that dabbled in different genres.However, the film is redeemed somewhat by the very good acting of Dicaprio, Pitt seemed a bit incidental. Style was amazing. Sadly, it lacked the substance.", "Hollywood in 60s is bout like how it is now": "Went to see once upon time in Hollywood last night it was good I first took interest to this when I heard who was in it Leonardo DiCaprio and brad Pitt hell yeah these to where amazing in this movie the rest of the cast was ok like Margot Robbie she didn't do much Kurt Russell was good and he even was the narrator and al Pacino was there so I really liked it I recommend it to upcoming filmmakers and actors like me this inspired me to make and write a movie once upon a time In Hollywood gets a 9-10 great movie", "Left not knowing how to feel.": "I've watched Manson Murder movies my entire life. It happened just before I was born so held a fascination for me. I thought that I'd like this movie too, even though it's not really about the murders. The acting was great. Story line a little drawn out and not nearly as exciting as most Tarantino movies. The ending was a nice bit of conducive action and gore. But that ending left me wondering if it was a bit disrespectful to the memory of those lost that night. I don't know. I can't imagine being a loved one of one of them and how it would make me feel. It's hard not to like this movie if it weren't about a real murder. But those murders are real. I just don't know how to feel about it now.", "OVERRATED? YES!": "This film proofs even QT can make bad boring movies. No story, no plot. And why Brad Pitt received an Oscar for his peformance is mystery to me. Again Tarantino changes history with his \"happy ending\" just like in \"Inglourious Basterds\". I was totally disappointed after the first viewing and that did not change after the second.", "Where is Tarantino?": "When I think back to the good old days of \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Kill Bill\", \"Death Proof\" or \"Django\", I wonder where Tarantino was in this film. No goose bumps, no deep characters, no good action, no plot twists. Except for the expensive selection of actors, this film is not for people who expect an engaging plot. I think Tarantino has no more ideas. Many of the scenes were similar to earlier films, but everything is loosely connected and can hardly keep you focused by almost three hours of runtime. All the time I was waiting for something to happen. If there wasnt these actors and a good set design this movie would have nothing worthy. I still appreciate the people saying this is ART and shows the nature of HOLLYWOOD. But you can present cinema as art AND have a plot.", "Need to watch again": "Everything is fantastarantino!\nSo surprising, and of gosh! Every scene are incredible.\nThis is a very good movie to watch again and again with friends :)", "Good for a nap": "So, I really was hopping to see something good tonight. I went to the cinema for the first time after ten years. The movie is too long. First two hours nothing really happenes, there's no real story. And then the ending is funny and interesting. But I almost fall asleep. Humor is not very inteligent. Five out of six of us weren't delighted with the movie so you can say it's crappy. I wouldn't recommend it.", "Pure Garbage": "This is one of the most boring, insipid, unimaginative, mundane, poorly acted, poorly directed films I have ever seen. Sitting through it was EXCRUCIATING! It was as boring and insipid as the day is long on the Summer Solstice at the Equator. If you took the profanity out of it there wouldn't be one complete sentence in the entire movie. And the gratuitous violence nothing short of repulsive. This film is enough to make an actor quit the business. I have never seen a film this unimaginative in my life! I'd rather be stuck on the A train at rush hour. I'm sure the conversations I'd over hear would be a lot more intelligent than the dialogue in this garbage film. No wonder it's a hit. Americans thrive on violence.", "Good acting bland movie": "Before I watched the movie I already read some bad review so I took the time to delve a bit deeper on the subject of the movie. Tarantino depicts all things the 60 are famous for in an effort to bring it back alive. Hippies, Polanski & Tate, Charles Manson, Bruce Lee, Spaghetti westerns, The Great Escape, .. you name it. The story is actually paper thin but nonetheless interesting enough to keep things interesting.The part about Rick going to Italy was a bit weird and uninteresting but nonetheless fits the story well. It was also weirdly edited into the movie, but it was classic Tarantino stuff... Hate it or love it.After being soaked in 60s moods for 2 hours straight, Tarantino steps on the gas and does what he does best. Going out with a bang.I don't compare movies so I won't tell you how well it matches to other Tarantino movies but it's a decent enough movie to give it a chance. The acting is great, the 60s vibe is spot on but it does miss some of the epic scenes we love Tarantino for.", "Meh..": "I get it, it's just \"once upon a time in Hollywood\", but I also don't really get it. I liked all the Tarantino elements, but the plot was just to boring.", "This movie is too long": "The movie is too long and It's not like any another movie of tarantino is Sad to say but is a bad movie is art and it is almost no action in the movie", "Hippie exterminator": "Worth the wait, good stuff.

I was desperately hoping something good would happen. NOT. WTF.", "Pretencious, but nice movie": "In this movie, every moment is presented similarly, acting, moments are over the top, over the topness is good when there's few moments of it, but 160 minutes of it is too much.\nStill, movie is so well shot, good looking, also movie takes you in it's world, takes you in 60s and that's great.\nThis kind of movies are not made anymore and Quentin deserves praise for creating it, but it's could have been much better.", "60s retro, music, acting": "This is no Pulp Fiction, but nevertheless amazing cinematography, music and brilliant acting - keep being amazed by Leo!\nIn for a ride in the 60s retro. May disappoint if you are looking for a plot", "Great film in many different ways": "Once upon a time in Hollywood was a great film. If I'm being honest some of the best acting I've seen to date, Brad Pitt played the part brilliantly and Leo did angles work. There were some flaws in which I didn't really understand if there was a whole point to the film yes it had a conclusion and ended well but the conclusion didn't really link to the whole film at all. There was a film within a film and sometimes I would loose track of what's going on.The pacing was very slow it took a long time for the whole film was coming around some times I felt some scenes were overly unnecessary in terms of the film itself. It was kind of like a narration a man telling the story of his life ( the man being Rick Dalton).The acting was amazing and it's difficult to believe they were acting but just being them selves. It was enjoyable to watch and fun. It was very violent towards the end but it was also funny again evening out the mood making it a lovely piece of work.There was very good music within the film which matched the whole vibe of the film itself more rock music and that was great.Lastly the cinematography was great and so were the cars, there were some very nice cars. Some very nice shots aswell and the weather matches perfectly it was almost like a Eutopia.I'm sure you'd enjoy this film though at some times it was a bit slow over all very enjoyable and somewhat funny, fully recommend.", "Great acting poor story": "Some of leonardo's Best acting as usual accompanied by tarintino's crappy film and story style.\nWith cameos from al patchino and Kurt Russell for what reason.\nElongating the film beyond reason ?\nThe dog in the move deserves a reward.\nGreat job from brad", "Using the big names Pitt, Leo and Margo to pull in the first weekend.": "Not close to a 9.5 rating. Will tumble to 7.4 I predict. Should be \"Helter Skelter Part 2\". Typical Tarantino plot--change history, like \"Inglorious Bastards.\" NOt quite as boring as \"Hateful Eight\" but similar in that the only action happens in the last 20 minutes.", "Not For Everyone": "This is a tough one to rate. On the one hand there is an abundance of brilliance here too long to list, not the least of which is the acting. DiCaprio's performance was nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Besides being fully immersed in his roles within his role, even his subtle expressions, body language, and timing were impeccable and unique to each character he portrayed, including \"commercials\". The Art doesn't get any better than this!Brad Pitt's character was my favorite part of the show. His Cliff Booth (stuntman, best bud) was the epitome of \"cool\", and a total joy to watch. There was so much charisma even in his silence, that I didn't even blink when he was on because I didn't want to miss a beat. Whether it's a movie or a TV show, the most entertaining characters are always those supremely confident winners with a flippant sense of humor (like James Spader in The Blacklist, or Tommy Lee Jones in MIB). The way he dealt with the Bruce Lee character and the \"hippies\", with his trademark grin and total lack of fear, were, to me, the highlights of the film.So while I feel the flick deserves accolades and high ratings for its layers upon layers of genius - if I had to rate it for overall enjoyment, or for its rank in the movies of my life that I loved - it would be way down to, oh, I think two stars. Why? Because I am a woman and this is a movie written and directed by a man, depicting mostly men and manly themes, for a male audience.If you would enjoy seeing a WHOLE lotta spitting, smoking, Old West saloons, old time macho movie clips, fights, blood, and gory violence... you'll love this! I paid very little attention to those scenes because they bored me and/or turned my stomach. But this movie had divergent storylines, and the one with Brad Pitt had more of a plot (as opposed to montages of movie clips and industry nods) and was of much more interest to me. At the end it all came together, albeit in the kind of Tarantino style that appeals more to males than females.I did like the dog though.", "It's just BORING :(": "The biggest disappointment from Mr Tarantino, unfortunately :( During 2,5 hours I kept on checking my watch and desperately wanted to leave and have some sushi at the restaurant next door to the cinema. No plot! No suspence! No action (except the last 15 minutes)! Just waisted time...", "So random": "Tarantino is a genius, top 5 for sure. But unfortunately this time it was so random.

Hey in 10 years it might become a classic, but for now it's just 2.5 hrs of random moments.", "Tension via reference to dark news item from yesteryear": "This movie inserts the Manson family into the story of Rick Dalton, actor in decline. I was foggy on the details on the Manson killings, but knew enough to get a sense of foreboding throughout.", "Brat Pitt at his best, but not Tarantino": "This movie could be one hour shorter. I would not missing DiCaprios parts, even they were good - but the there were two stories. First was the adoration of filmmaking and acting, second was the funny alternative revenge story to the Manson gang-cult.\nBrat Pitt was absolutly gorgeous as a character and a man.

He was mindfull like a budhists monk.", "Self-indulgent crap": "Big Tarantino fan, but this was boring, which is the last thing I expect from him.", "Awesome!!!": "You either will love it or hate it. If you didn't live through that era of time you will not be able to relate at all. Tarantino tries to put in as much detail as possible, it's difficult to add everything in a time where so much was going on.

This movie should have last 30 min's not almost 3 hours!", "Good movie, but...": "But it's important to be some how familiarized with Manson and the Family history. It's a enjoyable Tarantino movie!", "Stars In Cars": "I was feeling frustrated, waiting for the plot to appear. Then after two hours I felt kind of mellow watching something about Leo and Brad driving about on their days off with musical accompaniment, Then in the last half hour, the hippy bashing that we had been teased with became loud, and bloody, and clumsy. And POW! (sorry, pow) a real, tragic event had been revised for a rambling movie.", "Once Upon A Time...UGH": "P.S.: I'm not a QT fan, so according to your opinions of him, this will either be extremely biased or very honest. :)QUICK PLOT EXPLANATION\nThere's no plot.\nBut we are stuck with \"three\" characters. Rick Dalton, who is a \"dying\" actor. Cliff Boothe, Dalton's stunt double and... Sharon Tate?\nBasically it's a movie about the struggles of Hollywood actors in the 60s. A Hollywood movie for Hollywood made by Hollywood.\nThat's the plot, even though I can't really complain about it since all of QT's movies have no plot essentially. Tarantino loves to spill blood for the sake of spilling blood and that's about it, pure entertainment, there's no secret curtain that leads to a greater more philosophical critique of violence. Tarantino just love violence, as much as he likes feet.PRODUCTION\nThe production of this movie is really amazing, from camera angles to music to great acting. It really gets you in the feels when you get to see LA and how it was back in the 60s. Great cinematography though this is the only thing this movie has to offer and since QT has the money investors for that, he'll always be able to have great production.THIS IS NOT DOUBLE STANDARDS BUT HOLLYWOOD HAVING NO STANDARDS AT ALL.\nThis movie, not only had a very slow pace, but it was grotesque to the point that it was not needed and made no sense. I did expect more out of it since I'm very into the True Crime Community, I wanted to see more out of the Manson Family. When we were allowed to see it, we weren't given the opportunity to understand that we peaked into the secret life of the family. Because the pace was so slow and unnecessary blood was spilled we couldn't understand what was really happening and where we were. Then again there were scenes such as the one where Cliff tries to fix the antena on the roof and then there's a shoot of Sharon just dancing. What if it was a reference to a Robert Redford film? No one got it.\nAt the end of the film it feels really rushed up, like someone told Tarantino he can't make a 5h movie so he has to make it quick, and that really destroyed the mood (if there was one in the first place).I like to think that maybe he rushed it up so he could make us experience the adrenaline that'll come from the \"fight scene\" but that is very thoughtful and I don't believe Tarantino thought anything through while making this movie.REFERENCES\nAs you'd expect this movie has a lot of \"Easter Eggs\" from his films and spaghetti dramas from the 60s. That said if you aren't a huge nerd of the 60s era or just an old man with a lot of free time then you wont get the references. Thus I won't be explaining them cause they don't change the fact that the script was poor, bad and plain boring.THE COMPLEXITY OF SHARON TATE\nInstead of focusing on extremely unlikable characters that are the only real characters of this movie, I'd like to understand Sharon Tate's reason of being in the film in the first place. The only thing that was showcased of her personality is a short explanation of her dating life from someone else, her dirty feet and that she always smiles and dances. What a complex human being!\nSharon never got the opportunity to explain who she was and how her thought process is like, we didn't get the opportunity to explore her persona, so it made it very easy to understand why she was in the movie:\nFirstly, cause a hot character like her was missing entirely and Sharon (and Margot Robbie) was the element that would complete this feverish White Male dream. In other words Male Gaze. It was a male to male gift, offering close shots of her mouth, ass when running errands downtown and her feet. That's what her whole personality comprised of.\nSecondly, QT and his team understood that this movie had no \"driving force\", something that would sell it easily. So he chose to exploit Sharon Tate's tragic story and use it to promote a movie that has nothing to do with her. It was just a promotion with her name plastered all over it, which I find very degrading and misogynistic.THE AWKWARD CASE OF FEET\nI did mention before the scenes of feet in this movie. Both shots are uninteresting and long and even though I wouldn't have made it such a big deal because QT is a known foot fetishist, I will make it a deal because of how awkward both actresses felt about it. In the time of the \"Me Too\" movement actresses still have to repress their feelings about scenes, with Margaret Qualley disclosing that she had expressed her opinion on not wanting to show her feet but ultimately having to do it. Margot Robbie also got very \"upset\" when she was asked the question \"are we allowed to put our feet up in the cinema?\". I don't understand the reason of why such discomforting scenes, for both the viewer and the actresses, should be added since they offer nothing.BRUCE LEE AND WHITE MALE POWER\nOf course I can't not speak of the obvious thrashing of whatever comprises Bruce Lee's personality. It's very funny that Tarantino views him this way if you remember that he has been inspired by Asian cinema and martial arts to the point where he uses Bruce Lee's iconic yellow suit in Kill Bill! QT slandered Bruce Lee's character for a white male power fantasy action sequence and it's as degrading as it sounds.VIOLENCE\nTruth is I was expecting some bad ass fight scene with a pregnant Sharon vs the Manson Family but all I got was disappointment. The ending was not unexpected but rather confusing. It didn't fit the mood that had already been constructed. It wasn't confusing because the fight scene was bad, it was confusing because I really couldn't understand why that fight was happening, I couldn't understand what was going to happen next and why was everyone ok with such gore and smiling after everything took place.IN CONCLUSION\nAt the end of the day I give this movie 2/10 because even though it left me wondering if the movie finally started or not and how much I would rather sleep, I did enjoy the acting and the music. But that's to be expected since Tarantino has an excellent taste in choosing actors and music. But then again that's the only thing he's good at.", "Seems out of context but isn't.": "The movie is only better if you know what it is actually about. When I watched it I understood about the protagonists' lives but later understood through a friend that it was actually about a particular event with that particular actor that isn't even the protagonist. I won't reveal much about the story but again somewhat of a typical Tarantino. Maybe the first movie where I actually liked Leo's acting without objection. Of course, Pitt, Robbie, etc were great but maybe Leo was exceptional because maybe he knew what he had to do. The plot connects very well altogether at the end. You might wanna watch it for numerous reasons.", "Fantastic cast and director": "Brilliant, funny, violent, just what I expected!\nThe bond between Leo and Brad's characters was just perfect. Both actors are cast to perfection here and well deserved Oscar for Cliff Booth, what a brilliant character he is and if only he'd really existed for the Inglorious style twist.\nA really poignant ending, hopefully the families gave the ok.

The sort of scene, that after a very tense period, made the viewer jumping up and punching fends the air. The horror of the action and consequences is empowered under Tarantino, who do not direct, but choreographs a dance of flash, knifes, bloods, flames.\nMargot Robbie beautifully interprets Sharon Tate in her short Hollywood life, wife of a controversial Director Roman Polanski, a young actress at the start of her career, who was consider a sweet lovely person by all in Hollywood, and was tragically killed along with some guess, in her 9th month of pregnancy, in a brutal gruesome attack in her house, by drug addict of a Satanist cult.\nPartial of Tate story evolved and cross the acting career of a struggle actor, portraits skilfully by Leonardo Di Caprio, and his stage stunt, magically performed by the consumed acting of Brad Pitt, who unsurprisingly made so easy every scene he play. The three stories cross while the audience are all rapt by every frame, trying to find Tarantino personal addition that are part of his cinematographic style and signature. Tarantino and the cast gave \"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" so much more, taking highly skilled cast across a changeover of a cinema era.

Now we have to worry about some of them getting out for parole. Bless Sharon, Vortec (sp) Abigail, Jay and Steve. Just the way Tarantino ended it alone makes it an eight.", "Great acting but no plot.": "So I watched this film with my Mrs thinking it was going to be the best film ever! Anyway,after watching it for 1hr and my Mrs falling asleep for 30mins,she woke up and said 'what did I miss?' my reply was 'absolutely NOTHING!' The only thing that made the film was the great acting, awesome cast and good music score.\nBut the plot :\\???? Was he actually high when he wrote this? And was it just the fact that it was Tarantino writing and directing that made them sign off on this,in all hope that it would be another Pulp Fiction. But sadly it was not, it's probably Al Pacino's easiest and shortest film he's made money from not the mention Damian Lewis' less than 5 minute appearance.It's the biggest waste of a budget I've seen. Not impressed at all...........good to see Di caprio and Pitt together though, (only upside because they saved it from a 1!)", "Mostly about caste-system and castouts . . . in Hollywood": "Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood is really a great movie, if also greatly flawed, distinguished by keen cinematography, a ridiculously articulate soundtrack, and obsessively-accurate period detail. Writer-director Quentin Tarantino has elicited varied, nuanced, and powerful performances from a huge cast of stars of yesterday and today, and especially young stars on the rise. The story is, in fact, about generational succession and aging in Hollywood careers, and the 2019 film can be meaningfully described as a survey of the Hollywood caste-system circa 1969. Who is anointed to party and dance in the upstairs lounge of the Pan Am 747, who has to settle for first-class, and who rides way back in coach? As in the best of Tarantino's other films, the story also stirs the pot with explicit and implicit moral questions, one of which I'll enumerate here as \"how does Hollywood deal with the outcasts of its society?\"Spartacus Super Bowl has more to say at FOOTBALL examen . . . .", "Must See in Cinema": "You have to go to the cinema to get the best out of it.\nTarantino makes you feel like being in the 80s for 2:40 hours straight. Dev. gonna watch it a few more times", "Quentin Tarantino does it again. Masterful work.": "Since it's Oscar weekend. I decided to watch, Once upon a time in Hollywood. Starring Brad Pitt & Leonardo DiCapo, directing by the great Quentin Tarantino. The storyline is about a star and his stunt double during the 1969 era. Now I'm a huge fan of Quentin work, love all his movies. Leo was great in this role. Love his character. A struggling actor trying to make it big. Brad Pitt was tremendous, such a kick ass character. Both deserve that Oscar nominations. The storyline was very good. My favorite storyline was between Leo and Julia, she played Trudi during his movie scene. I love the small cameos Quentin had in the movie. The cast of characters was great. Everyone of them was something to watch. The music was so beautifully done. Quentin knows how to use music in every scene. I don't know how Quentin makes this movie like a 60's movie. It was just a wonderful movie. Yes the movie is slow at first , but it's so much fun to watch. Also love the twists that Quentin did during the Sharon Tate thing. So far it's been a wonderful day to celebrate my 50th birthday and watching a movie. My rating of this movie is 8/10. #onceuponatimeinhollywood #quentintarantino #leonardodicaprio #bradpitt #margotrobbie #charlesmanson #sharontate", "Ridiculous!!!!": "I've loved every Tarantino movie up until now! I think he went a bit to far by adding Manson to the pic", "Worse than I expected": "My biggest complaint with this movie was the pacing. Tarantino has always been an expert at pacing but this movie seemed to drag during many of the scenes, and it seemed like entire sections could have easily been cut out without affecting the story (like the endless scenes of people driving around listening to the radio, and Brad Pitt feeding his dog). Tarantino should have used a lot more discipline in the editing room.Besides the pacing problems, the movie was very lackluster, and most of the \"jokes\" fell flat, at least for the audience I watched the movie with. The audience (it was a packed theater) was mostly silent throughout 90% of the movie.I also dont understand the concept of completely altering events that happened in real life. Especially when it comes to a relatively minor event like a few people being killed in the Hollywood Hills. I dont mean to sound coarse or insensitive, but its not like Sharon Tate was running for president or trying to solve world hunger. The fact that Tarantino changed the outcome of that night just didnt do anything for me, and I would have rather seen a more accurate portrayal of the events (surrounded by interesting fictional characters), like Spike Lee did with Summer of Sam. I think that would have resulted in a much more potent and hard-hitting movie.As you can see I still gave the movie a 7/10, so I didnt think it was terrible by any means, but overall it was just lackluster... thats the best way I can describe it.", "Not even qualified as a movie.": "Random footages gathered together so created the so called 60s.\n80% of the scenes are not contributing to the storyline, only the last 40 minutes make real sense.\nPeople who hyped it, plz have some sense of movie-appreciation.", "Wow but I WANTED MOOOORE": "I loved the movie, but I expected more. I love the big 4 names here, Leo Brad Margot and Quentin and maybe that's why I wanted more and more, it's very different from Quentin's style but you can see his touches in it which what I love, the camera angles, the music, the music off when a door is slammed, the unnecessary plots, the long long scenes. This is what I love from Quentin and he did it here but it was very very peaceful until the end. I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to a really hard core die hard Quentin fans. Even some of the fans won't like it. I gave it 9 because I want another big fat joint from Quentin to end his career with and this is not it.", "Nostalgic Hollywood": "Tarantino takes us on a nostalgic trip of Hollywood's golden time in 1969. The story follows the failing actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his stuntman Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they work various tv shows and movies. They interact at various stages with the Manson family, where Tarantino teases the audience with what is about to happen. Meanwhile Sharon Tate (Robbie) has moved in next door to Rick.The movie builds up slowly to the final scenes where three of the Mansons break in to kill Rick and Cliff. We finally get a taste of Tarantinos trade mark gore in the ensuing fight culminating in Rick killing one of them with a flame thrower.Not Tarantinos best movie but the characters keep you interested. I think he romanticised Hollywood a bit too much with the happy ending and could have closer approached the ideas he touches of violence in film.", "Overrated director": "Self indulgent hobby move.

What a twist! M Night Tarantino has done it again!": "It's Brad Pitt's film, and one of his finer performances, in my opinion. DiCaprio's character was almost completely superfluous to the \"plot\".Do this: Get a digital copy of the movie, get some editing software, keep all of the scenes that Brad Pitt appears in and cut out as many of DiCaprio's, and any other's, non Pitt scenes as you deem unnecessary(to the... Pitt plot). Et voila! A story!You're welcome.I give it an honest 5/10, primarily because it's unnecessarily long. I should give it a 1/10, for balance, but I... just couldn't do that... to the lovely Margot. :-)I'd quite comfortably give the \"Pitt plot edit\" version, that exists only in my head... for now, a minimum of 7/10.Of course... there are those who would argue that the whole \"Helter Skelter\" business was but one act in the ongoing live action roleplay known as Project Fear and/or Chaos, and nobody really died that day.Not me though. Heaven forfend!", "Absolute Garbage": "Slow as. No plot. Nothing happens until 15 min left in the movie, then it's done. Crap. Disgusted in myself for wasting 2 and a half hours of my life with this garbage. Should of known better. Will not watch another Tarantino movie.", "I'm crying...": "Is this where the movies are heading?? more and more awful, meaningless and boring films. I don't know what to say and what to expect. I think I will only watch older movies from now on, It's crazy how disappointing can something be.", "Movie plot not so great": "I didn't care too much for the movie plot and flow but I loved Pitt and DiCaprio together! It reminded me of the rapport between Newman and Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.", "Am I Alone?": "I found the movie dragged and dragged until I finally realized that half of Dicaprio's solo scenes should have been cut.\nBrad Pitt was stoned during the entire movie.\nRetro clothes were era-correct.\nWhether or not it's a work of art, time will tell.", "Not as good as all other QT movies": "The movie is not that great. The plot is very boring. I felt I was not attached to the movie except for the last 10 minutes. One of the good parts of the movie is when Brad goes to the place where his friend George is. This scene has some intense moments. Other than that, the last 10 minutes are the best.QT, you could do better, believe me.", "Good Just Good": "This movie is a classic art film for first 2 hours & then the fun begins. I enjoyed the movie. Specially Brad Pitt. The movie is good.", "Not that great, just boring": "It was boring. Just random scenes put together. The only thing that kept it going was brad pitt. The rest just sucked.", "A little disappointing": "Despite having not grown up in LA as Tarentino did, I loved seing what LA looked like in '69, and there were still a lot of nostalgic moments for me being born in '72 and growing up in the seventies and watching similar TV series to Bounty Law. The acting and cinematography was excellent as is to be expected. However, this exploration of LA in '69 is cobbled together around a very thin plotline. I get it, that this was more a trip of nostalgia and insight into the lives of the three protagonists, and to that effect it succeeded, but it ended up feeling that the film was just meandering aimlessly towards the climax, which was a reimagining of the night of the murder of Sharon Tate by the Manson family. Just was left feeling a little disappointed.", "Just don't get it.": "Wife said it was the worst she'd ever almost finished seeing. Not sure it was worse than 7 weeks in Thibet.We just didn't get the it. Didn't seem to flow. Didn't have much lasting relavance to us. Seemed to go from shot to shot without much to string along.Maybe the best example of how poor it is was in a car driving. Short clips of music, fast forward, new clip of music, fast forward, and so on for 10 minutes.Maybe the last quarter was super. Don't know. We left about 3/4 of the way in.The only bright spot in the movie was that many of the set locations were ones I've seen in various films and tv shows.", "Must see film!": "As Tarantino goes is superb. Long but continuous. Editing is classic and I thought it would just be about Manson killing Sharron Tate. But the direction of the film only heads there briefly. The acting from DiCapro and Pitt are unique. They click off each other in a way that makes you believe that they have been friends for a long time. Also the humour made everything moment captivating. SPOILER ALERT!!; Tyler Durden vs Bruce lee was one of the best scenes in relation with the thought of Pitt as Tyler. All in all would watch again", "This movie is just nice to watch": "I can just relax and watch this movie and enjoy the acting, characters, sets, cars, and music. It's just enjoyable and it's a fun watch.There is just so much to love about this movie. The best parts in my opinion is just seeing the characters spend a day in the 60s.I don't really know what else to say, if you like Tarantino's movies then you'll definitely like this one.", "Couldn't follow the story.": "Could not understand anything about the film. With random cuts between characters the story was extremely hard to follow. The story was all over the place. Love the actors chosen but I could not follow anything about the movie.", "Parallel Worlds.": "Meandering. Enjoyable, Tense. Funny. Really good music.Not totally aware about the movie's plot (???) I expected an ending with what really happened . Na. This is Tarantino.He takes history and he turns it inside out. This history would be wonderful...but Polanski's future movies may have been somewhat tamer. Sometimes grief brings out the best.Loved it how DeCaprio ended up looking like Jack Black.", "A nice trip back in time to 1969": "This was a special movie for me. I grew up in Southern California and was 12 years old during the Summer of 1969. That was a very memorable time with the 1st man landing on the moon, Woodstock, the Vietnam War, and the Manson murders happening especially close to home. Quentin Tarantino was so incredibly accurate with his depiction of the look of Southern California at the time along with including many items only Southern Californians would be familiar with. That convinced me he is a serious student of the history of Hollywood. His attention to detail was amazing down to the inclusion of a picture of a local news celebrity (George Putnam) on a bus stop bench. I realize there may not be enough action for some Tarantino fans but the last part of the movie should satisfy some. The actors do not disappoint and the fairytale ending although shocking the first time I saw it was rather satisfying the second time around. After all these years it was nice to watch the Manson followers finally receive the justice they deserved back in 1969.", "The best Quentin Tarantino movie ever": "This by far is the very best Quentin Tarantino movie ever it makes jango look like a nothing . It's like a time machine 1960's Hollywood. This and the first kill bill are Tarantino's two best movies ever. Everything else is just gangsters movies which has been done to death since The Godfather. This is a subject matter that you can feel Tarantino gave his love and all his heart love and soul making this movie. This is not a movie it's a time machine. This is my new favorite movie ever. I hate Tarantino as a person but this movie is his very best out of all his films.", "Great Acting From Top To Bottom": "From start to finish and from the most minor character to the two leads. The young girl actress, the oriental poser and heck even the dog all did well.It also introduces the viewer to the story of Sharon Tate. I had no idea.", "Worst Movie in a while": "As I'm not from the \"golden era\" I'm movies as people are talking about and born too late, this movie was not entertaining nor exciting at all. No plot and no character building. Rated 3/10 because of the good acting", "I was unable to enjoy the movie expecting what was to come": "I love going into movies without having any idea what they're about, so I was shocked as the story started to develop the Sharon Tate angle.\nI just thought it was so distasteful, treating such a horrific event with the Tarantino typical witty banter. And expecting his classic exaggerated gore in a murder scene of the pregnant Margot Robbie.... I just spent the entire movie thinking Quentin had lost his mind. Why would he do such a gruesome and sickening scene? By the time I learned the truth, I had already spent more than two hours in anguish and was unable that enjoy it. Will have to watch it again with a new perspective.", "Spectacular!!!": "This movie really captures the feeling of the time and setting. Amazing story and character development as well. Cinematography is on point. Set design and colors are perfect. I love how the movies the characters were in tied back into their real lives. The ending was so great and the transition to it was great as well!!!!!!", "A Testament to the craft, a vision of splendor...": "\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a classic. The onslaught of negative reviews since The Golden Globes have done nothing to hinder my opinion of the film.It can be considered a slow-burn, in the likes of \"Easy Rider\" or \"Rosemary's Baby\" - And I believe that is on purpose. This is QT attempting to grasp the grandeur of the golden age of cinema. That being said, \"Once Upon a Time..\" will work best for those who are keen on the art of cinema, and understand the pulp of the 1960's.\nToo often do we build expectations of something that are built off of other's experiences, only to be let down when our experience does not match.I recommend going into \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" without any expectations. Do not expect a Tarantino movie, as he is constantly reinventing himself. Do not expect a Best Picture winner, because truly, that is not a real definition. Do not expect anything at all. This is a film that will cleanse your pallet, and if you let it, will fill you with atmosphere. It was created with a love for the craft of cinema, in itself, that even the most devote of moviegoers will find joy in.\nWe see 1960's Hollywood; the titans of America, the movie stars and those pulling the strings, in the height of Hollywood's influence. The acting is out of the park. The plot is a full circle (which other reviewers seem to be missing) which aims to prove the most mundane events can shape a person, and even give them new purpose.\nOverall, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" does what it aims to do perfectly - which is; transport us to Hollywood in the 1960's, amongst rising and falling stars, amongst pain and plight in America, with characters we feel we have always known, with a bit of the old Tarantino twist.\nJust like Rick Dalton, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a true, American classic, sometimes overlooked, but not soon forgotten.", "...... Boring, no content, good acting but nothing happens.": "The movie is about nothing, nothing happens, there is no story nothing to connect the dots. Half way through everyone in em cinema was talking to eachother. It is SO BORING!!!\nWorst Leo movie ever, worst Pitt movie ever, worst Margot Robbie movie ever, and worst of all, worst Tarantino movie ever.\nGood acting but no content.", "Such high hopes": "I had so such hopes for this movie, it's Quentin Tarantino, he always makes great, awesome movies, but this was such a dissapointment...\nMy first review, that's how bad it was. It should have been just an half hour long.", "Finally got around to watching and it was great!": "It looks like a bunch of kids with short attention spans couldn't handle the film but don't be put off, atleast if you're old/mature enough to watch a film/live life without the need to look at your phone every five mins for a little digital high. Seriously though it was great, flew by, great acting, good action, beautifully shot, unpredictable and just different in a much needed way with the current repetitive Hollywood film model. Just finished it and already want to watch it again with the wife to see if she likes it too. 10/10 from me.", "Alternate Reality": "Quentin imagines a day in 1969 where things could have gone differently and what it would look like. The costumes, scenery, and research are so well executed.Another point is at the end. When Leo torches and yells it cures me on another level. Not the torching but the punishment of those crazy fools", "My god": "Will its not the worst tarantino movie its the worst movie of all time ... im a big big fan of tarantino but this movie is just awful and boring i waited for this movie for a long time .. watched it yesterday and i couldnt sleep from the disappointment", "GOT ?": "What story ? What was the story ?\nEven if i tried i can't spoil the story for anyone.\nThe worst Tarantino movie for me!", "Big budget, no substance": "Some interesting scenes but most were just plain boring.

But this is a very weak movie experience", "Actors good, plot sucks": "Why make this..guess for Tarantinos own amusement...", "Very Forgettable": "I read a lot of reviews before I watched this movie and they all talked about how great this film is. It is about as good as Jackie Brown or Hateful Eight. All are very much forgettable. Unfortunately I think Quentin Tarantino is done. I will not pay to watch his next movie in a theater.

They are empty inside but has very shine cover. Every time, the world holds its breath and with high expectations wait from maestro new \"Pulp Fiction\", \"Reservoir Dogs\" or \"Jackie Brown\". Poor people.. are so na\u00c3\u00afve..\nThis happens now.\nMusic and Commercial on radio, Cars, Night neon street lights of LA clubs, westerns and crime TV shows, hippies on the streets. The whole story, about actor Rick Dalton, his friend-stuntman Cliff Booth, actress Sharon Tate, their problems and chemistry, all of them is only nice distracting cover, while the main character and story, is an era. Era of Hollywood 60th. This is probably only true intention why Mr.Tarantino wanted to film \"Once Upon a time....in Hollywood\".\nAnd you, as an audience, will love it. Yes, to you! Because every time when you seating behind Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate or Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth and listening radio with them, while leaving Cielo Drive, turn to Benedict Canyon Drive and in few moments car is filled with shining light reflections from Sunset Blvd. In such moments your soul literally traveling back in time almost 50 years ago. I am saluting to the Art Department, Production Design, Set Decorators and of course Music Department. All of you guys deserve at least Academy Award nomination.\nDespite all positive things above movie doesn't have one main thing. Film does not set a main goal. \"Friendship?\" Perhaps. \"Get used to new times and continue career?\" Noooo. \"Finding your place in life, after leaving screen?\" No! If the goal was to show us famous crime 1969 by Manson Family...it also failed.\nIn some way, I understand that it was hard to rebuild shocking kill of Mrs. Tate and her friends, I think because Quentin is kind of romantic inside. As I said, previously he (Writer and Director) is obsessed with Hollywood of middle 20th Century, and for him, as for fan boy, it would have been like spit on his childhood dreams, on that golden age in LA, where he grew up, no matter how hard and nice it was in the same time. However, it is also not the first time when \"Master of brutalism\" and \"King of blood scenes\" decided to create his own version of past. Just like in \"Inglorious bastards\" & \"Django\", where \"good guys\" takes above over the evil by smashing and burning it. So when Cliff Booth at the end smokes \"very special\" cigarette you can understand, everything in final will be way more fantastic as it was in real life.\nFew words about Characters. Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth (Former military; war Hero; man of his word) best and probably only one friend to Rick Dalton (played by Leo DiCaprio) who is an Actor at the dusk of his career. Years ago, Rick was famous by portraying \"good guys\" in Westerns and Action movies. But times go by and now at the era of Hippies & Rock'nRoll he can expect only small roles as a typical \"bad boy\". As an action star, he had a Stunt double, and that is Mr. Cliff Booth. Both of them were work together more than 10 years and after long period, working relations transform into friendship. The whole story is spinning around these two. We became witness of falling and rising Rick Dalton as actor during one filming day, Moments of shame from Cliff where he can't hold his mouth shut and hands clean. Sharon Tate played by Margot Robbie does not bring any important information or action in film. She is just enjoying her life while Cliff and Rick working. That's actually all about this movie..\nOverall. \"Once upon a time...\" glorifies Hollywood of 60th and Bromance inside of it. That what movie about. It is not about hard work in industry or killing beautiful innocent young Actress. No. Unfortunately. Quentin Tarantino continue to live inside of his phantasmagorical 35mm film, full of great music, brilliant dialogs, Nice cars, dirty female feet's in the middle of screen every 15 minutes, and with a story....which does not give anything important to you. 7/10.", "One of the worst movies of all time": "Without exaggeration one of the worst movies of all time.

The script seemed disjointed and all over the place. Filmography looked like from a low budget movie. Very long film, and the end left me hanging... not a good place to be...", "The number of 10 star reviews is simply not realisitc": "I am a long-time fan of Tarantino. I watched both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in theaters on opening day in two different cities. I have seen all of his movies in the theater within a week of their release, and I absolutely place three of his films in my all-time top 20 list.Let me summarize this one as quickly as I can with no spoilers. Tarantino is trying to do two things here - write a love letter to Hollywood of the 1960s and predicated that on a post-facto would-be revenge story about the horrific Manson family murders of Sharon Tate and her unborn baby in 1969. The film making is top notch as usual (my literal one complaint is that DiCaprio did NOT look like he belonged in the digitally manipulated clips - the sweat/oil on his skin did not match the other original actors) and the editing and storyline are very well managed. The reconstruction (digital?) of 1969 LA and Hollywood is phenomenal. It's on par with the job on Roma, which was set in 1970s Mexico City and rightfully won a Cinematography Oscar.There is plenty to see and talk about in this film. The acting is great, and the fictionalized narratives are realistically believable. It's a fine film.But this is NOT a 9 or 10 out of 10 by ANY objective scale when taken against the history of film-making. IMDB has lost control of the ability to regulate real and fake reviews. Literally every big-time wide release movie now is flooded by either 9/10 star reviews or 1/2 star reviews. It's ridiculous and the site's credibility suffers as a result.\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a fun 2hours and 45minutes and a very well made film. It is not an achievement in cinema nor is it one of Tarantino's top 4 films.", "Good scenes, average movie.": "It's an OK movie but more in terms of it being a series of good individual scenes. When you put them together they're fairly disjointed and don't make for a great story. Quentin's traditional blood path scene feels very out of sync with the rest of the movie. Overall it feels like a movie made for other Hollywood movie industry people rather than a regular audience.", "A strong movie but suffers from overextension": "The story acted out by Brad and Leonardo is nothing short of a bromance, however the movie suffers from a long length. While we get to see the character development, intrigue and drama from Rick Dalton's and Cliff Booth's side. We never realize what's the point of watching half throughout the movie cameo appearances of Sharon Tate that don't bring any substance to the story apart from being filler.", "Back to the Hollywood Time": "Hollywood past\", set in Los Angeles in 1969, tells the story of outdated television actor Rick and his good friend and double actor Clive trying to return to the glory days of the past and find a place in a good dock at the end of Hollywood's \"golden age.\" The whole film recreates the \"Golden Age\" of Hollywood in the 1960s, whether it's a car or a poster. It's like a reversal of time in the film, reviving the old dreams of Americans who went through that era.1. At the beginning of the film, Rick and Clive participated in a TV series \"reward Law.\" although the play is fictional, the bridge section and style clearly salute the American dramas of the 1950s and 1960s, such as the \"Wild Dart Guest\"wanted\" and so on.2. The restaurant where Marvin and Rick eat is called \"Musso & Frank Gilr, a landmark restaurant in Hollywood's golden age, which opened in 1919 and is now there today.\"3. In the film, the Roman Polanski couple open the famous playboy \"mansion to attend the party, although the mansion was actually bought by playboy in 1971, but the party in the film is very 1960s style.\"4.

Havin a bit of it could still be fine i guess. When you warpped it up you got a real life, after all.", "One of the finest movie in '19": "Before this movie got released I was expecting a good-old Tarantino film with some good-old Tarantino touches like the intense scenes with major plot-twists throughout the whole movie. I read some light spoiler free reviews and they were really mixed between an \"Amazing masterpiece\" and \"Tarantino's most disappointing work\". Right away, I knew what was waiting for me in the cinemas.\nI'm that type of guy who really appreciates great acting and good music with not too much of a plot, and I have to tell you this movie has one of the best performances of Leonardo DiCaprio's and Brad Pitt's and adding to that some really great soundtracks from the late '60s.\nWe see 3 different people living their lives and working in the same industry:Hollywood. Rick Dalton who is an actor from a now almost forgotten Tv-series working to get his fame back, his stun-double Cliff Booth who is a really chill war veteran, to Sharon Tate who is a fresh star in Hollywood.\nRick struggles to get a decent role as an actor, starring in different Tv pilots cast as the main villain, and he copes with these struggles with alcohol. Not enough, he has a new neighbour who just moved in named Roman Polanski, who was one of the biggest directors that year. A really good contrast between the two of them.\nOn the other hand, Cliff the stuntman doesn't really care about fame he is just happy with what he has. Living in a trailer park next to a drive-in cinema with his dog, driving and old car and helping out Rick with everyday problems is what he is happy doing, you can really relate to him.\nSharon is living her best life going to parties, having fun, helping out others and doing all this with a smile on her face. She is what the '60s is meant to be. She brings joy to the movie.\nThe story is about 3 days of the life of these people, mixed with some fine humor and homage to Hollywood.\nTarantino said he made this movie for himself. A love-letter to the late Hollywood. This is the way the industry worked those days, and the way it works today. Staying relevant in Hollywood is a really stressful and hard thing to do, not even the biggest names in the industry can stay relevant all their life. Well, maybe only a very few.", "10/10, you must go and watch this now!": "This is the movie archetype which is highly praised by critics, fans and not fans, and you only recommend it to others full heartedly because you want them to suffer for more than two hours like you did. Or to give them the chance of a lifetime to enjoy this masterpiece.", "Tarantino at his worst": "This is not only a bad tarantino film, but simply a bad film, zero plot, zero story! I honestly thought I was on the receiving end of a bad joke.", "A Fairy Tale About a True Story": "Quentin Tarrentino has created a memorable film about a period of time in Hollywood, 1969, which contained great social upheaval. It is portrayed through two men, one an actor ( Leonardo DiCaprio) who plays a lot of cowboy roles and his good friend, his stunt double(Brad Pitt). DiCaprio's character moves into a beautiful home on Cielo Dr next door to Roman Polanski and his wife actress Sharon Tate. Brad Pitt's character lives elsewhere in a trailer which he shares with his loyal well trained Pitt Bull. He often drives the fancy Cadillac of his friend around the LA area. While on several of his drives he meets a young hippie type girl who catches his eye. He strikes up a conversation with her and she tells him that she lives on the Spahn ranch with her friends including Charles Manson. He tells her that he knows Spahn as he did some stunt work there. She invites him to visit and see Spahn. This is where he meets members of the Manson family(Manson is not present at the visit). Leonardo's character, meanwhile, struggles to resurrect a flagging career taking a role in a film and trying to control his drinking. His agent, played by Al Pacino, advises him to go to Italy to appear in the emerging Italian westerns. He follows his advice and goes to Italy. Then we meet Sharon Tate played by Margot Robbie in Feb of 1969 as she is married to Polanski and entertains friends at her home on Cielo Dr which they have rented from someone that Charles Manson knew and had visited there. There is a charming scene where she is out shopping and sees a movie theater where a movie of hers is playing. So we get to see Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate watch herself on screen. We as viewers thus get to see her as she was. The final part of the movie I will not divulge the ending except to say that it purposely does not portray the true reality of what happened to the 8 month pregnant Sharon Tate and her friends. Rather an alternate reality which to me was very ingenious.\nAll of the performances are excellent. Brad Pitt just keeps getting better as he gets older. I really loved this movie.", "I wish i could give it more than 10": "What can I say. Im a HUGE Tarantino fan. This film gets a bad wrap for being \"boring\" which is underrated when you're used to a certain genre from Tarantino. However if you dislike this film for being \"boring\" you shouldn't be reviewing films. This film has everything. Leo and Brad Pitt, what is there to say. The dialogue, acting, cinematography, everything is perfect. Yes its a little slow for Quentin, but this could be the best ending of any of his films. This movie is all around perfect.

Yes please.", "Not basterds or Django": "Went into it expecting a Tarantino movie...\ncame out of it disappointed cause it's not...\nGood movie, long though... and not Tarantino again...", "Seriously dull movie": "I had to double check if this is Tarantino movie. Movie is so long and so dull that i watched it for like 5 days until I completed it. But I was persistent to watch it until the end. Ending of the movie is... I am lost for words... Like someone was trying to make a parody of a Tarantino movie. Maybe Tarantino himself wanted to make parody of his previous work. I lost almost 3 hours of life on this movie.", "Marvelous Movie": "At first glance it seems lame an about a forgotten actor Leo. But as it goes on.

It is far from it.Let's start with the movie plot: oh hold! There's no plot in the movie to comment on. I don't mean no plot as in 'pulp fiction' like non linear, messy yet profound kind of plot, driven by deep and stunningly original characters whose decisions and development culminates in a thrilling climax. There is absolutely no plot at all.None of the characters ( Rick Dalton, Cliff Booth, Sharon Tate) develop an inch_ except for the one time where Rick's character takes a sudden leap with just a NARRATION, embarrassingly so.The movie just pointlessly meanders between scenes that neither develop the story /characters, nor have anything to do with one another.The only one or two bloody and gruesome scenes in the Act 3 build up neither from any back story nor from character's purpose, thus nullifying the thrill anyway.The actors, however, have performed extremely well. Leonardo DiCaprio should win an 'Academy'. Margaret Qualley who played ' Pussycat' should win an 'Academy' for the supporting role. Brad pitt was decent and Maggot Robbie has nicely embodied Sharon Tate.Also, the cinematography, the musical background and the showcasing of 1969 Hollywood classy and the work of a geniusIt's an alright movie for people who share Tarantino's nostalgia of the 1969 Hollywood, but for the rest it's a sleeping pill. Take a deep nap in the theatres goodluck.", "Quentin's response to #metoo ?": "After all that Hollywood is going through at the moment, seeing a complete overhaul in how movies are made and how they are seen, QT comes out with this... I for one am over it, I don't care about the plot, look at the bigger picture here; there is not one woman over the age of 30 in this movie, not one man under the age of 30 (40 even), I don't need to see another Hollywood bait movie where a 60 year old man is sleeping with a teenage girl. Whoever this movie is for its definitely not me, and it definitely doesn't fit into the current narrative in Hollywood. But who cares right?! Nothing will ever change, and this movie proves it.

Frequent captions along the way gave my wife and me clues as to what the movie might be about. But after about 15 minutes into the movie, and every 5 minutes or so after that people started walking out of the movie. I have only done that once in my life. Mr. Mondo's video 40 years ago. But I seriously gave it consideration that day.The movie had its moments. Hence the 2 star rating. And it had the usual gratuitous Tarantino violence with which the director has made himself famous.

It was a pretty cool trip back to a different time in Hollywood through the eyes of two long time friends and some others. Style of the movie was pretty standard Tarantino which I have no issue with. Overall it was a fun movie with great acting and a good story.", "A declaration of love for cinema": "A sincere and passionate declaration of love for cinema. \"Once upon a time in Hollywood\" is a fantastic film for all the people who know and appreciate that magical time for the world of cinema. 1969 is the year in which traditionally it's said that an era ends, and it's no coincidence that Quentin Tarantino sets his film in it, telling us his version of a tragic and disturbing event that went down in history as the Tate murders.The brilliant Quentin does it his way, having fun creating an alternative version of the story, maybe like a fairytale, and enriching it with fictional characters. Cinematography, costumes and scenography are magnificent and make perfectly the climate of those years. The interpretations of the protagonists (Leo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt above all, but also Margot Robbie and the other ones) are excellent. We laugh a lot (it's important to know as much as possible the references), we reflect a little and we let ourselves be drawn into that inexhaustible vortex that was the Hollywood of that period. Funny to see the portraits of real characters like Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee, in my opinion also the teasing are done with obvious affection and there is no intent to offend anyone.Then, in the last part, Tarantino delights us with a series of scenes in his typical style, up to exalt us in a couple of moments. The ending is very liberating, and in a sense reconciling, I found it very apt and also exciting. Then, of course, everything is carried on with humor, something is left purposely pending (like the story involving Cliff Booth and his wife) and we can't know what will happen after the so much desired final meeting between Rick Dalton and his neighbors. But I can say that, after almost three hours flown in a moment (impossible to take your eyes off the screen), I left the cinema with a big satisfied smile on my face: I think that making these effect on viewers is a great achievement for a movie.", "Good quality, bad buildup, great at the last 10min": "The story was good but the movie had absolutely no buildup or exiting moments.

Any film that wanders into Manson territory will do that to me. Then Brad Pitt picked a fight with Bruce Lee (perhaps unfairly portrayed, but to a purpose). I suddenly had a glimmer of hope that the ending may be \"basterdized\". Thankfully it was. There was still a twinge of sadness as the credits rolled and I remembered the true history. But when the dog food flew I practically cheered!I've since watched the film a few more times and actually enjoyed the story of Rick, the actor struggling to stay relevant and his stuntman Cliff. But the ending gets me smiling every time. Proof that serial killers can be made fun of, if you have the courage (or clout) to do so.", "Not good": "I enjoy most (not all) of QTs films, yhis has to be the worst (even Death Proof is better). Slow paced and self indulgent with poor character development. By the end of the film I didn't care what happened to any of characters. I don't know how you make a film this bad with such a great cast.", "Would have made a great book": "The parallel of the two stories kind of bended in time - a has-been actor and a new aspiring starlet - is a great idea. The inversion of the Mansons story - great idea. Making a buddy story out of an actor and his stunt double - great idea. A ton of great ideas that don't actually work together. \"Look how smart, talented and cinephile I am\" - this show-off kaleidoscope of a movie oozes director's self-admiration much more than the actual storytelling.I guess that's overall a Sony's mistake, they agreed that Mr Tarantino would have the right of the final cut. And that mistake made Mr Tarantino to sink in his own (undoubted) talent, but not in the story. So the story went a little too south.Would have made a great book though, funny, detailed, unexpected. Literature can tolerate a story that lack crispness and clarity, but is full of atmospheric deviations.", "Technically great, but not a good movie": "It deserves more than 5 of 10 stars, but I feel that the collective rating is misleading, so I try to even things out.The acting, cinematography, locations, music etc. Is state of the art.Sadly it is just a display of what happens when you give a respected writer/director a massive budget, acquire great actors and just fly away with hubris propelling you with thrust from the derri\u00c3\u00a8re throughout the production.It has all the right ingredients, but they are mixed and arranged in a way that I never would have expected from one of my favorite directors.But for all the great work he has done, I'll let this one slide.Edit: I had way too high expectations for this movie. Tarantino has made several of my favorite movies, but they can't all turn out the way I hoped for.", "Soulless": "Even if I wanted to spoil this movie I couldn't. This movie has no plot, no characters no nothing. It is easily the worst movie I've seen in my life. This movie tries so hard to be funny and it puts these characters nobody cares about. For the sole reason of padding out time.The main characters are the worst I've seen in my life. They have no soul, no personality. They feel like a robot who has been given a script. There was this \"main\" character that watched a movie for 5 minutes. After that WE NEVER SEE HER AGAIN. Shame on Tarantino for releasing such garbage to the public.", "I am dissapointed": "First of all I want to say that I am fan of Tarantino movies. But this one is not the best. Oh my God how I loved Django and Hateful 8!!! I enjoyed every single second of those movies! I was waiting for this movie long time but it was a great disappointment for me. Not interesting plot at all. Just a combination of moments. Yes it is beautiful scenematography, all these light boxes etc etc. Great acting. But not interesting :(. Remember in Reservoir Dogs scene dancing with knife? Remember in Jango scene with skull? In Heighful 8 the story about sucking ... In this movie there are no such moments, no such dialogs.", "Extraordinary And Atypical boring": "After seeing the movie I understand the incident with that guy that was on the phone in the theater during a screening. The film was excruciating boring; felt like was directed by someone else.Where is their action he brought in Kill Bill or Inglorious or Django... where is the witty and smart dialog from Pulp, Reservoir, Hateful.There's NONE!! Just do yourself a favor and re-watch some of his old movies.", "Quentin tried to make a Quentin's movie like Quentin's movies": "Well, firstly i think there r few parts not really natural to be connected, even i cant tell where they r....but due to it basing on real cases, i can accept the odd connections; secondly, i think it doesnt present why charlie wanted to kill everyone in that house, there should be more scenes about 1: beach boys rejecting charlie's record makes charlie hate that spot of sharon's house, its a fit to rick yelling at hippies to make hippies turn to rick's house, all about wrong-turn-element. 2: charlie kicking pussycat at home for showing he is the boss and no one can make mess for him, then made a revenge plan....u cant lack charles manson element for once upon time after all, right?....so it is an artificial movie so far, hope quentin can fix the problem in the following extended version....", "Storyline was poorly executed - Not for casual viewers": "This movie had everything it needed to be a great film. Unfortunately for me, the story and plot were horribly delivered. It was very messy and confusing and too difficult to follow. Lots of random scenes that came out of nowhere. New characters were brought into scenes with absolutely no introduction, yet the movie expected you to be able to follow even though you had no idea who on screen.Very slow paced except for the last 20 minutes which showed a bunch of hippies attempting to commit murder and showed brutal scenes and then the movie came to a sudden finish. I feel like this scene was simply added to give a forced climax to a movie that was too long and boring just to make people leave remembering only that scene.This movie is not designed for casual viewers, don't expect to walk into this movie with no prior knowledge about it or it's storyline and expect to have a good time. You won't. You will regret it and waste your time and money. It might be for some but certainly not me. I would not recommend this movie at all.", "Aka we want the oscar.. give us the oscar": "Well,well,well a gift from tarrantino to hollywood i can said easly that this one gonna win the best picture .. this is the thing's the acadimy wants i can say the 2 first hours made for the honoring of the classic movies then the left of the movie helpt the story and made a good ending the cinematography just so awesome also the screenplay but the perfection was in the acting and btw leo gonna nominated just i have one think that make me cringe BRUCE LEE i mean cooome onn you're better than this...", "This movie offends Bruce Lee fans": "I like the film in general. But it has a tempo problem and some scenes seemed unnecessary to me. Brad Pitt and Di Caprio made a good job.\nI have to say that i certainly didn't like the portrayal of Bruce Lee in this movie. It does not add any value to the movie and offends people who love Bruce Lee. I don't understand why Tarantino still depends himself for that.\nAnyway if you like Tarantino type of violence and the actors go ahead and see this.", "Absolute rubbish- from a Tarantino fan boy": "Awful.

Everyone said that \"the ending is sooo good\", but you eats e around 2,5 hours to get a 10 min action packed scene. Not worth it. There is no interesting story, no real character development, no problems to discus, nothing at all. Just time wasting. All in all a very bad movie.", "Not Tarantinos greatest": "Didn't have any expectations going into this film. All I can say is that although the acting was good the film itself was weak and slow. I actually looked at my watch during this film as I was looking forward to it ending. Sad, I expected more from Tanatino but he's admittedly been fairly hit and miss of late.", "One of the best paced movies maybe ever!": "Quentin Tarantino has crafted a film that longs for a different time, wistful for what it represented. It envelopes you in this vintage dreamworld of movie stars, hippies and old Hollywood. Tarantino immerses you in this world in such a way that as the film neared its end, I really didn't want to leave. I loved the sweet, delicate friendship between Cliff and Rick. Tarantino's protagonists are so often ruthless and stoic, Rick Dalton is the very opposite. Leo DiCaprio is pretty damn phenomenal. A showcase of DiCaprio's comedic chops, but also a surprisingly sensitive performance with serious depth to it. An adept comedic performance, but an adept dramatic one as well. Margot Robbie is luminous as Sharon Tate. She exudes so much joy and positive energy and just so much life making. She conveys so much about this woman we don't really know beyond her tragic fate. Brad Pitt is good. It feels like a role that only he could play at this juncture in his career. Don't really understand all the praise for his performance, but he's just undeniably cool, but also thoughtful. If you wanna see a great Pitt performance in my opinion, go watch Ad Astra. The passion for this era in Hollywood's history in Tarantino's screenplay and direction is palpable. Highly recommend this film! Tarantino is a damn fine filmmaker with a singular voice and vision like no other. In the age of franchises and cinematic universes, Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers still knows how to make a film that knows how to capture the praise of critics and your aver age moviegoer without compromising the way he makes movies.", "Great director, great actors, 3 hours with no plot...": "It's such a shame to have to give this only 4 stars, but I feel I have to, as it went for almost 3 hours with literally no plot. I love Quentin Tarantino, Leonardo Dicaprio and Brad Pitt. This was directed perfectly, with great cinematography, and perfectly acted by Leo and Brad, but there was just no plot. The whole thing was pointless. It's literally 3 hours of nothing. Margot Robbie only had about 5 lines in the whole movie; why was she even in this?! I loved Django Unchained, Inglorious Basterds, and Reservoir Dogs. Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and The Hateful Eight were also pretty good. It's just a shame that this had no plot.", "Blah": "Great actors with sloppy direction and a pointless ending. I like historical fiction so this movie failed in delivering a coherent story ending. If you simply want to drool over the cast then well done. Glad i rented rather than spend theater prices on this mediocre film.", "LOVED THE ENDING.": "Wow, the first hour was pretty hard, as you're not sure what is the issue at all, but it really gets better and better, I would say since the ranch scene. The Spahn Ranch scene is absolutely terrifying, the movie suddenly turns into a horror film, loved it.As Sharon Tate was shown as such a lovely person, I think we all thought this is for us to feel worse when she gets killed, but no, what a pleasure it was to see DiCaprio and Brad Pitt kill these 3. Loved the ending, loved the movie.", "Hollywood Love": "Its actually a love letter to the old hollywood which is more or less gone. In the age of streaming services going into the cinema is profane. Just like the reality altering ending.", "Well Made QT Movie": "Very well made movie. The view into the old Hollywood was very refreshing - the dances, music, characters etc. The last 45 mins bring the story together very quickly and are mind blowing. Brad Pitt and his dog are the highlight of the movie.", "Terrible script but good acting": "The film was very disjointed and did not seem to know what its own central story really was. Was it revisionist history again or was it a film about movie making. The Bruce Lee scene was an insult and had no place in the film. The characters of Pitt and DeCaprio were too much of a caricature. It was somewhat entertaining but definitely no best picture and Tarantino's getting a nomination for a badly written script is absurd.", "Couldn't believe my eyes": "I love Tarantino. All my favourite movies are QT movies, but he is rapidly going downhill in my opinion. The Hateful Eight was ok. This is more of the same, probably worse. Now, it looks and sounds great. It's shot well and all the cast and crew did a great job. Other than that, though, NOTHING HAPPENS. A complete waste of three and a half hours. I waited and waited and waited for the story to kick-in and for this film to get going. All of a sudden it looked like it was about to. Two minutes later the movie is over. Maybe I'm just getting old. My musical tastes are stuck in the 90s and no new films will compare to Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, or even Kill Bill from the early aughts, so maybe I've just turned into the old guy complaining about new things and how they were all better \"in my day,\" and that they don't make them like they used to. Who knows? Not me, at least. The most pointless three hours plus I've ever wasted, which is time I'll never get back.As I've mentioned, all the technical stuff is brilliant, so if you like all that then you'll love this. Likewise the time period - if you love the look of cinema back then there will be plenty for you to enjoy. There just isn't a story at all. Tarantino rewrites a lot of history for his movies (see Hitler's death in Inglorious Basterds) but it wasn't enough to add something to this. Just a bloated waste of time.Lots of people liked this so I'll just conclude by saying this just wasn't my cup of tea, and hope that QT returns to form for his next movie. I'd love him to try Sci-Fi, as that would a new one for him and I reckon he could make something amazing. Not sure if he's into that type of thing, though.Anyhow...... go away now.", "Is Tarantino Sending A Message?": "Once upon a time men were men, women are thin and beautiful and as such showed skin.

I'd say over half the cast are pointless, the whole film could be condensed to 30 mins, still make sense and have all the funny bits in. I was very disappointed to say the least. Some sort of worthwhile plot would've made this moderately bare-able, far from what I expected from a great director.", "I mean, what can I say?!": "This movie is as good as you would expect. Not quite \"classic Tarantino\" but in retrospect, just as good. To see a different side to one of America's most infamous murders, justice is done.

Watch this movie, you'll kick yourself if you don't.", "Tarantino Making more Award Winning Movies": "This was a classic Tarantino movie, a huge build up for the last scene which is full of violence and gore. The problem that I was having with the movie, was that I was having trouble figuring out the plot and the main conflict. It didn't hit me until after the movie that the conflict was Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio) believed that he had officially become a \"has been\" and was worried and disappointed at himself for becoming that man. I just relieved that by the end of the movie he finds that he is still appreciated and loved as an actor. Having that plot graph and to see that conflict be resolved by the very end of the movie was really cool. I also understand why Tarantino won a Golden Globe for his directing in this one. In a way, this was a movie within a movie, and to see the behind the scenes shots of actors calling for lines or messing up scenes and having to rewind the camera angles to restart, was very cool. To see that aspect of filmmaking was amazing and there is no doubt that he would win the globe because of it. The acting was good as always, it was cool to see Rick Dalton break character when he was filming, and it shows the wide variety of DiCaprio and all of his skills in that business. Overall, a fun movie to watch, and very well done.", "WORST MOVIE EVER MADE": "If you like movies with no plot, where nothing happens and you wish you could waste 3 hrs of your life... this is the one for you. good reviews of this crap have got to be from all those suckers who cant admit that their favorite director wrote a terrible script about absolutely nothing except conceited blowhards like themselves.", "1/10 without the A-listers": "Classic cars, good sound track and good acting, poor plot/story and direction.", "Worst movie since waterworld.": "Like the actors but was very boring and felt like the longest movie ever.", "EEEK!

I never took that route, I decided to hang in there thinking it's going to pick up, because it's QT! It didn't...Movie was way too long. I get the whole idea QT trying to get the vibe of the 60's etc, but it was overkill. My 25yr old nephew had no idea to the references and kept questioning.. why? There were some sparks of great acting, and overall Brad Pitt was great! Leonardo had a few very good scenes, and you could see how great of an actor he really is. But the build up to these scenes was an 1.5 hrs too long of a wait to get there.Climax was pure QT! Loved it!In the end, I was kind of bummed out (no pun intended)", "2 3/4 hours of my life that I will never get back!": "Without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Dull, boring and pointless. Would have given it 0/10 but the only redeeming feature was the performance by Julia Butters which was all too short.", "Wonderful ending, but movie rely's too heavily on ponderous scenes of DiCaprio.": "ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD relies too heavily on screen time given to the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio, which is fine but overly familiar. Brad Pitt fares better with the scenes written for him and if you added up the total running time of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate it would clock into just under 15 minutes. The movie would have benefitted with less DiCaprio forever proving he's a good actor and more of Robbie's presence. To the millions who have grown up with the Manson killings this movie is extremely satisfying and surprisingly moving at the end. The ending will stay with you. I can only think the much ballyhooed \"Tarantino's love letter to 1969 Hollywood\" is exaggerated by critics eager to get their quotes on TV and in headlines. The 161 minute running time gives you fleeting glimpses of 1969 Hollywood at best and not enough of them. When in doubt Tarantino leans on long scenes of DiCaprio. He's the padding of the picture. I wanted more glimpses of 69' Hollywood and less \"actors scenes\". Oh, and much more of Margot Robbie.", "BUT,": "There are three interwoven stories told in a way that we know Tarantino likes to tell us, but after the end it felt like it was all to tell us just one story. A story that tells us that it should have ended exactly like the way it ended.", "Soley Watch Because it's Tarantino": "Trust me, I get that this was a nod to the old days. I went in knowing that. But it was just flat out corney. Only Quentin Tarantino can get away with this trash. Any other writer, producer, brought this idea to Hollywood, it would've been a Youtube movie at best. Worst movie this year for me.", "Liked it but had high expectations": "I am a huge Tarantino fan, and was excited to watch this. It was great, but I felt it was missing some of the key elements of what I like about Tarantino movies. It was missing: those interesting, quirky, eloquent conversations.. Rick speaking with the girl was the only part that came close; The power of the music meshing well with the scenes; And a strong, enthralling plot.I thought maybe I was being too critical or my expectations were too high, but the day after I rewatched Django, and that reaffirmed my opinion on this movie. It had all those things I like about a Tarantino movie. Inglorious Basterds also had it, so did Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.Just my opinion, and I know people like movies for different reasons, so to each their own.", "The Emperor's New Film": "As you can see by all the 10 star reviews, there is incredibly high praise for this film, but having myself just left the cinema, I feel like I've been conned by Tarantino and all those complicit in hyping up this utter waste of a story. Plot? Didn't start until the final 15 minutes of a nearly 3 hour story. That's objectively weak storytelling, despite the homages and stylistics and texturing. So what the fudge is going on with these reviews and the high rating and the endless standing ovation at Cannes film festival? My guess is it's a combination of the Hollywood fake review machine, a test of Tarantino loyalty toward those under his influence, and possibly a range of self-deceiving who think the superficial elements outside the plot making it a satisfying film. Again, when you wait over 2 hours for the plot, it's not a satisfying story. One of Tarantino's worst by far.", "And the point was?": "Nice acting, but not much point. Like the big lebowski but without the dude and a story.", "Boring and misogynistic": "This was a real disappointment. QT has completely lost his magic. Rick in this movie is the perfect analogy. He can still do it (as in the scene with the little girl) but despite his acting skills he mainly produces rubbish with his best work far behind him. Same with QT: That scene with the girl is great, as is the scene when Cliff visits the ranch. The rest is forgettable and boring with the exception of the over the top violence at the end and the unnecessary disrespect to Bruce Lee. But not only is the movie boring and way too long, it also has a misogynistic tone that is only amplified by the fact that Tarantino worked with Weinstein on numerous movies. I might be able to overlook the foot fetish and the fact that Margot Robbie is only allowed to look good in 60ties outfits in this movie. But the fact that Cliff is clearly portrait as the hero of the film despite murdering his wife (purely for being annoying) and mutilating two hippie girls in an unnecessarily gruesome way really left me thinking that QT needs to sort out his mental problems with women. Cliff is also happy to get blown by someone 30 years younger, as long as it is legal. Yuck. If only women were like Cliff's dog, submissive and quiet (almost no lines for Sharon Tate, the little girl does not mind Rick mistreating her for the sake of good acting) until the master let's them off the leash. That seems to be the message of this movie. Smart asses might point out that \"it was like this in the sixties and therefore it is an accurate portrait\". But that excuse would only work if there was some compassion and sympathetic portrayal of women in the movie as well. Sadly, there is none. You might point to Sharon Tate, but hey, guess what, she is the happiest when she sees herself looking dumb and awkward on the floor as a sex object for Dean Martin. And if this all was not enough proof of misogyny QT reinforces it by casting a guy that assaulted a woman at a film festival a few years ago. Shame on all the movie critics who overlook this and only talk about great acting, camerawork and movie references. Boring and misogynistic. 3/10", "Brainwashed high ratings": "I get that this movie is an homage to Hollywood, but shouldn't an homage include a plot? This movie goes nowhere except to show off old Hollywood and fine acting. But bottom line, it was boring. Those who gave this movie high ratings are just as brainwashed as Manson's cult in the movie. Just because it's filmed by a great director and great actors doesn't make it a good movie. If I want to see Hollywood nostalgia, I'll watch a documentary.", "Untarantino": "1. If you're, e expecting the usual Tarantino flick, this is not it.2. Second, the movie works for the American audiences and for folks that either have lived through the life and times of Hollywood in the 60's, and 70's.3. The first 2 hours deal with Leonardo, a fading star, and Brad Pitt, his stunt double as they saunter along Hollywood. Just two standout scenes in this period - the Brad v/s Bruce Lee skirmish on sets and a gripping scene on a dilapidated film location that is occupied by a cult.4. The last 30 minutes deliver a fantasy twist to the Charles Manson murders (an ineffective Inglorious Basterds, if you will. And the movie ends with a question mark.It's not a patch on other Tarantino flicks and is intended only for his inner-hard-core fans or for the masochists.", "Cliffs wife": "Is Robert Wagner suing?\nClearly the demise of Cliff Booths wife (who mentions her sister Natalie) is a reference.", "When a cheer erupts in a movie theater..": "You know the director struck a nerve when the audience spontaneously cheers a movie. When an evil has haunted the public psyche your whole life ( I was born in 1969), a little fantasy may be in order to right the karmic balance. Loved it. Walked out feeling ten feet tall.", "The \"once upon a time\" finale": "In my opinion the movie was a little bit too extense. Long scenes with the principal characters that apparently leed to nowhere. But the best was yet to come... The final part is undoubtedly genial, and it managed to get some good laughs from the audience. After all we all love to see the bad guys get burn (in this case literally), whether they are Nazis or hippie cult members. But even so the quintessential part of the movie is without a question the very final scene: when the movie title appears slowly as you are still absorbing what you just saw and figuring out that this was indeed an alternate story to the sad reality, and you realize the true meaning of the \"once upon a time\" title that fits perfectly and it's absolutely cathartic.\nVery good \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2030", "If you are not a fanatic it will be boring": "Cinematography is great. Perfect casting. Great acting. But first 2 hours are only for people who lived in this times and are nostalgic for it, or people who are interested in this part of the hiatory of Holywood. Everyone else will find it extremely boring even with the perfect performances of Leo and Brad. In the last 30-40 minutes finally something is happening and it's great.So, it's definitely not for everyone and that's why we have so many separate opinions about it.", "Simply bad": "The hype and the excitement surrounding this movie is curious to me.The movie has no plot. It feels like a collection of unrelated scenes that go nowhere, along with references that also do not contribute in any significant way (the only purpose they serve is that the viewer would feel satisfied by identifying them).", "No plot whatsoever. No point": "There is no plot. There is no point. I wasted 2.75 hours of my life for a BS self indulgent mess of a movie.", "Great scenes and acting but no coherent story": "Tarantinos movie about the film inudstry in the 60s - 70s is a fantastic showcase of cinematography, editing and acting. All the actors in the movie are outstanding with the obvious standouts being Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio.The movie is filled with great scenes throughout with one particular standout that, without a doubt, are very entertaining. However a lack of story in the movie is evident as it can feel directionless. This can get frustrating as the movie goes along with no visible arc.The movie is also not as bombastic or action filled as other Tarantino films. Despite this the movie is worth watching due to the positives outwaying the negatives.", "What did we watch?": "Exactly, WHAT did we watch? What was the subject? What were all these things for? Okay, those guys have played well, we all have the same idea about this. But... what was those guys played? No action (except one scene tbh) , no fun, no romance, no mystery, no sci-fi, no erotism... Plus, what was Margot Robbie doing? Why was she there? Why is she on poster of movie? Alright... I really appreciate to Tarantino for that he did show us how much can a movie be boring with the some of best actors in the world.", "BAD BAD BAD BAD MOVIE": "Wtfff did i just watch???????\nThere is no storyyy\n2 fking hours for nothing\nI'm so disappointed\nDon't waste your time and watch it!", "Retro Tarantino": "Everybody wait and miss the Tarantino,we so much curious about the next Tarantino movie.We have a so big expectation because he is a deserved this expectation and Tarantino meet the all expectation.Firstly perfect cast and expected perfect acting.Di caprio and Pitt's great harmony,Margot Robbie's cheerfull acting.Long runtime but dont feel long.Unexplained Manson story if you know nothing Sharon Tate,Charles Manson,movie could be a boring and so unexplained.Movie ending not like the real story.Tate dont die and Tarantino create a new reality and Tate lives in this reality.I loved this idea.Tarantino again did this job.", "Truly appalling movies": "One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I should have known better than to give another Tarantino movie a try. 2 hours of nothing followed by 10 minutes of pointless, grotesque violence that has absolutely nothing to do with any sort of plot. Utter disgrace of a movie", "Boring, it was never ending.": "I liked the acting, but other than that it was so boring.", "I didnt enjoy this movie": "I was interested throughout most of it and then got really bored, and then got disgusted. To put it shortly if you don't like sexualization of children, dogs getting punched, graphic violence, over 2 hours of build up, you won't like this movie. A lot of feet in the movie which is Tarantino being gross as usual. Should have known not to give him another try.All the woman in the film are depicted as crazy or ditzy or dumb. This is my observation as a male. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job as actors but the story is just lame. Some of the violence is almost like it's meant to be slapstick but it's pretty graphic so it just made me uncomfortable. Some moments were sort of funny, the direction was honestly pretty captivating, but some parts were so slow and tedious to get through and then when something exciting happened it would make me uncomfortable. I also had to Google most of the character's names to understand what was based off reality and what wasn't. I don't recommend this to anyone. I could dissect it even further but I don't have the energy, it Was all sucked out of me through this film.It's written and directed in a way that sucks you in but at the end I was just like \"Wow that was 3 hours I can't get back.\" I don't feel inspired and no critical thinking has really been provoked by this film.", "just another Hollywood": "Compared to the amount of advertising this movie is not what I expect nothing new or creative", "Booooooo": "Took forever to get anywhere and when it got somewhere I was not impressed... just sad that I wasted the time", "not bad": "Seeing the last half hour to determine, this is still the most familiar of the crazy genius quentin, in the smooth under the spread of a gentle background, it is no wonder that he wanted to prevent the plot. Lee and Pitt, the film's best gay friends, are lovely, taking us on a child-like tour of 1969, a time of promiscuity, ritual breakdown and anxiety. A lot of crap, a lot of good footwork, a lot of old friends, a great show, looking forward to the day when it gets talked about, maybe a little bit of fandom. Xiao li is as crazy and lovely as ever. Peter let me get back to the feeling of his heart in junior high school.", "Surprisingly good": "I\u00c2\u00b4m not a tarantino fan and i heard this movie was boring so i was not interested in this movie, but i saw this movie and is actually good, the story goes up and down through a lot of situations not connected at all showing the contrast between those characters, DiCaprio is a succesful actor afraid of becoming useless in the new industry while Robbie is an unknown actress enjoying his young life in hollywood, also Brad Pitt is a unique character that for some reason looks like a good guy, being partially redeemed of his past, you don\u00c2\u00b4t need to understand all the context of the 60\u00c2\u00b4s to understand the situations and the ending can be very entertaining if you don\u00c2\u00b4t take it so serious, the bad side of the movie is the feet closeups, very unnecesary and disgusting.", "A very good movie": "Although I may not have understood or caught onto some of the references made I still really enjoyed the movie. Some of the scenes really did blow me away. The use of the almost anti-climactic ending was very powerful to me as it was a final point of perspective on not only the movie but also the things being talked about.", "Thrilling masterpiece once again from Magician Tarantino": "This Tarantino magic is truly unique; like nothing else in the film industry. It takes a deep journey into the lives of two men looking for their place of fame in Hollywood; all masterfully complimented with outstanding filming, talented acting, and a mind-blowing production set that deserves in full the awards it has received due to its time period accuracy. Being set in the late 1960s, there is no 21st century vibe throughout the whole film which fully impresses me. A lot goes on during the film and requires full attention and concentration. Multiple viewings is also advised. Quentin Tarantino applies a genius twist to a true story, thus resulting in this thrilling masterpiece.", "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is original, subversively funny, and even heartbreaking. Rating: 8.8 / 10": "Tarantino is a dreamer who would love to change events, taking matters into his own hands. Since he can't do that, he makes movies.This film was a tribute to Sharon Tate and her family. Anyone who is not familiar with the horrific story that happened with her will not understand anything about the film. One cannot forget the film's title: \"Once upon a time\" refers to fairy tales, in which in a perfect world tragedies would be avoided and executioners of humanity's worst crimes should be dealt with. It's a shame that a lot of people didn't understand and hated the movie. All the construction of the characters Cliff Booth and Rick Dalton was necessary to culminate in this redemptive and \"tarantinesque\" end, in which everything ends well, the happy ending of every fairy tale, the other end of the \"once upon a time\" line. Perhaps the film's biggest flaw is the story itself, so little known and for that reason it didn't touch the vast majority of the public.I even think that sometimes they exaggerate the \"deification\" but it's impossible not to have fun in most of his films. Inglourious Basterds is amazing, and I don't even think this one will beat it, but compare to what?!While the stuntman (Brad) saves the day, not letting the hippie psychopaths kill them and whatnot, the actor (Leo) is seen as the hero even though he hasn't done that much and is invited to go to his house. Sharon possibly in the future even making a movie with her husband.I understood that the stuntman represented the backstage of the films, all the people who write, direct and among other works and make the film work as a whole. While the actor's job is to just enjoy all that work and \"just\" act (not that it's easy), thus becoming the star of the \"show\", the guy that people will remember and glorify when they see such a movie.", "6 stars for the acting": "With great sorrow, I must say: Tarantino you've blown this one. You had a great cast and you could have one of the best films of the decade. Unfortunately it is a bad movie", "Lot of show, no tell.": "I love Tarantino as much as the next movie buff, and have an interest in Charles Manson and the summer of love, so this seemed a match made in heaven.This is my opinion, agree or disagree, but please don't think that I'm try to pursue you to agree with me.While the cinematography and sparkling images were breathtaking, I felt it was dragged out and lacked any substance.\nThe setup is clear:Rick and Cliff are buddies. Cliff is the hardass and Rick the mumbling 'hero'. While the humour between the two is good and Cliff proves to be tough as nails, the scene with Bruce Lee was funny, I felt it was dragged out and took long to get to the point. The side story with Sharon Tate feels a bit off. She doesn't get a lot of development, while there is a lot to cover there, and she feels like an extra that's made more important than that she is.\nWhile I reconigized Charles Manson from the very first moment he came on screen, and gave a grin when he said the 'piggies', I feel he was portrayed as a mindless killer. Never mind the fact that the real Manson had different intentions when he stormed the Tate residence...\nAlthough the music during the final battle is just amazing, the ending leaves a lot to be desired. With that change in history, how would the movie industry have looked? It feels like getting half a Dollar for two hours of work. Bit of a shame.", "Very slooooow burner. It may only work ONCE upon a viewing only.": "I loved the art direction, period design and fashions, the 60s look is masterfully captured. Character building and acting are first class, as more than enough time is given for that. The grimy, creepy Manson hippy cult, at the old film set farm property, is totally believable, they need a good wash and have great potential in a future film project. The first big laugh was about an hour into the movie. The last few big shock laughs are pretty much at the end. Maybe if you don't mind the slow pace of 'no country for old men' you may rate this movie higher than I did. I'd rate 'No Country' about an 8. Summing up, the best features are the way the 60s are captured and the deep character building, bonding and acting skills. But there's nowhere near enough key moments (i.e. causing at least semi-intense emotional reactions) to make me re-watch this in a hurry. Probably a movie for me that can work once only.", "Regret buying cinema ticket for it": "3 stars out of 10\na star for scenography and costumes that truly brought 60's backa star for actinga star for some of the shotsStars not earned\nno plot. just a mush. art for art's sakescenes insignificant to the movie, that could have been cut out to make it shorter and less boringonly 5 or 10 minutes of action out of 2h and 40 minutes of movievery little of clever and funny dialoguesno moments of suspensionno drama, no moments that could make me cry, laugh, be happy or extremily angryno depth, no little extra something that could have leave an impression on me.\nI bought VIP tickets for this movie, just wanted to treat myself & my bf.

In whole film we see feet from different states and angels! which is Unpleasant. The other thing is that there is a lot of things film but pointless!", "disappointing": "The film lasts 2 hours and 41 minutes. That is at least 1 hour too long. Certainly in the first half, the film is a vehicle for cramming different film styles into 1 film. The story is painfully slow at times when it doesn't matter. It becomes (somewhat) worthy of sight at times when the pace goes up. Almost as painful to watch as the One Hundred Foot Journey.", "Slow, thin and just plain wrong": "I must say I was very disappointed. The QT action we know and love is really just a glimpse, and the first 2,5 hours of the movie are slow and don't provide more story than could have been told in 20 minutes. When we finally reach the climax, it is just plain wrong from a historical perspective and gives a silly picture of a horrible incident.", "You'll want a steak you'll get a undercooked happy meal": "In a word...meh. Acting made it enjoyable, story and substance made it forgettable.", "Ok": "I've spent a pleasant afternoon watching this movie. It weird and not for everyone. I think you have to know the story of Manson family before you watch this. The parts of the story that Di Caprio was in should be erased. They were super boring and it was like they definitely want him to play even if his role has nothing to do with the movie except of a really small part that he is neighboring to Tate, but the rest of the movie was interesting.", "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood...There Were Movie Posters": "There is an enormity to see in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" Quentin Tarantino's new movie about the film industry and Los Angeles is replete with 1960's era iconography. Especially eye-catching are the lustrous B-movie posters featuring actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), which if were historical, may have even found their way into the Dwight M. Cleveland Collection.If you've ever wondered what it would be like to tag along with an actor and his stuntman to and from a Hollywood set, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" provides just that sort of vicarious opportunity. And there are thrills along the way like watching Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) demonstrate Kung Fu, and watching Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) basking in the glow of a silver screen.", "taste Like a vert personnal trip": "This movie IS not so Bad but tastes like a very personnal movie.

I don't have to watch tonnes of violence to enjoy a Tarintino movie, although the iconic final scene is my favourite from his movies since the opening scene of Inglorious Basterds. After stewing on this movie for almost a year and only rewatching it twice in order to not devalue it, I can tell you it only gets better. I appreciate how Tarintino has matured as a director, and I almost feel like this should have been his 10th film, as it encapsulates everything he is as a director. If I was to suggest an improvement, I would say include at least two more scenes with Mansen, as I genuinely think he could have been an iconic villain. His one scene is tense and hard to watch, as the audience we know what this man is capable of. I can understand why they don't include him, in respect to what happened that horrible night, and maybe his one scene was just enough, as his presence is felt throughout the film.\nUltimately, a great movie that gets better with age and rewards true movie fans and everyone in the industry. A true summer movie.", "A Movie That Follows the Normal White Centric Narrative": "This was a stereotypical white person is the best Hollywood movie that we are used to seeing time and time again. I almost turned it off when they basically character assassinated Bruce Lee. I don't care if this is a 'normal\" type of Quentin movie, I found it just insufferable.", "Best character left out to dry": "Pros:\nThis movie is beautiful and a cool look into the life of 1969 film centered Californians. All of the cinematography was elegant and fit perfectly. I enjoyed getting to see the ins and outs of the movie industry back then. The costumes were great. I loved getting to see Spahn ranch and the suspense that scene brought. This movie was brought to life by a podcast I listened to called You Must Remember This' episodes regarding the Manson Family murders. It basically created the suspense for me as Sharon walked around town and anytime she was shown by herself.Dicaprio's performance was stellar, it was so believable going in and out of \"film mode\" for the filming taking place in the movie. It was a great performance. I loved the Cliff (Pitt) character, he was such a great character but the way the writers dealt with him is where my cons begin.Cons:\nThe best character in this movie was Cliff as mentioned above, he was a war hero, stunt man, beat up Bruce Lee, and murdered his wife and got away with it. That is such a good character arc, but nothing seemed to phase him. I would've loved for him to show remorse for his wife, maybe feel some compassion for George Spahn, or have some pent up aggression towards Leo's character. I thought maybe them not addressing Cliff's problem and continuing to work with him could be a jab at Hollywood's neglect of victims in the past and present and eagerness to cover up certain scandals but that may be reaching. But it still stands that Cliff could've developed into a fantastic character whether negatively or positively depending on how they addressed him.Sharon Tate to me represented the pure Hollywood starlet that now doesn't exist. Maybe she was supposed to be surrounded by mystique as she was in real life but I would've loved to see her and Polanski have an arguement, Sharon catch Polanski doing something illicit, or see a Polanski/Sebring conflict, anything to expand her character and allow Robbie to act.Ending:\nI liked the ending, with Tarantino behind the wheel, I knew that the ending could be different than reality and I am kind of glad it was different than actual events. I absolutely loved Leo using the flame thrower in the end.Go see this movie since it is Tarantino's second to last and just love it for what it is a beautiful trip to 1969 Los Angelos.", "Expected more": "I love Tarantino movies especially because of his long funny but meaningful conversation and because of violance.

So boring and nothing happens. A waste of time for sure.", "I know it is not for everyone, so what...": "They say that \"time is fluid\". It is beautiful. But I don't know about that. What I do know is that some movies are like a ship without an anchor, or an expedition without a compass, or a madly growing tree without a root. I mean, yes, all these can be beautiful things, but when you kind of flow on the ocean of Time and Space and try to share with your audience piece by piece your enjoyment along the whole voyage, you need to send a clear and recognizable signal in a code...To do that, you need disciplines, like all Quentin movies before, violent but disciplined. One story line, one purpose, one hit, one blast, one madness. Here, I kind of know what it is about. But I don't feel its disciplines. Or, let me say, the whole story looks condescending. It seems to be telling me \"I know you don't know what Hollywood was like\". OH, yes, I can say that to people 10 years younger than me, too. What's the fun?Yes, it is not for everyone, then who is it for? Name the group of \"right audience\" and forbid the rest from going to the threatre...Otherwise, get some disciplines, the code, and then Time can still be Fuid...just in a more beautiful shape.", "Worst movie I have seen in Cinema, ever": "I went to the cinema with my friend and I shockingly, for the first time in my life, immediately fell asleep (instantaneously)! There was no plot, it was so boring for a 28 year old like me. I walked out of the cinema after nearly an hour of painfully waiting for the movie to end.

Wasted money. :(", "I love the revision, and a peek into older Hollywood...": "As an avid reader, pod-cast listener, and all-around consumer of anything true crime... I was dreading what I thought was the inevitable ending.I really liked the revision of what was, not only one of the most needless horrors in Hollywood history, but one that propped up a mini psycho who was nothing but a glorified pimp on a head trip.Also, I really enjoyed the throwback look, and in general enjoyed the atmosphere that Tarantino created...per usual", "plays with the history, to zero point; plus, no ending!": "First off, I think that most of the reviewers here, especially those who've given negative reviews, have entirely missed the point. They fault the movie for being slow, for example: movies of that era were much slower-paced. They fault the DiCaprio character for being unlikeable: he's supposed to be both pity-inducing and unlikeable. They say there's no plot, no suspense: there's a good plot having to do with the friendship between the two men, and there's LOTS of suspense, if you know your history. From the moment we see the Cielo Drive road sign, my heart was in my throat, and it stayed that way, all the way through.You see, I'm in my late '60s, so I was well-aware of what was going on in 1969. I'm also a big Tarantino fan, so when I heard this movie is his love letter to the Hollywood of the 1960s, I was very excited. After all, if anyone could make a love letter to that period, it's Tarantino. We've known for decades that he's immersed in 1960s movies, music, culture, all of it. When I heard that he had messed with the history, I thought, \"Well, that's OK. It's alternative history, or historical fiction--whatever.\" After that, I avoided spoilers, because I didn't want to know exactly HOW the movie would alter the events of the Manson murders.Given that, I very much like the movie all the way up until the ending (or, as I will explain, the lack thereof). I love the scene with the actor playing Sharon Tate watching the real Sharon Tate in \"The Wrecking Crew.\" I love the many, many accurate period details. The art direction, production design, cinematography are spot-on. The bit with the DiCaprio character on set and muffing his lines, then being furious with himself, was poignant & funny. Indeed, a lot about the two TV series that DiCaprio has been in is funny. And the Spahn ranch scene is convincingly creepy as hell.The only thing I found truly lame is the Bruce Lee character. Why even put Bruce Lee in the movie, if you can't find a more accomplished actor (fighter) to portray him? That scene serves to establish what a good fighter Pitt's character is, but what an insult to Bruce Lee!So let me get to the climax and ending. First, the fact that just by chance, the DiCaprio character briefly drives off the murderers, such that they change their minds about whom to murder, is a fascinating twist on the real events. Their reasoning for why they change their minds is also intriguing: \"This actor represents a culture that raised us on images of murder, so let's murder him.\" Hmm, I thought. Hippies who started out with peace & love values but whose minds were twisted by a cult leader might well think that way. Then, the fact that the likeable & physically powerful Brad Pitt character, with the help of his likeable & well-trained dog, is able (even while laughing & high on acid) to thwart their murderous intentions, is also an intriguing twist. The scene with DiCaprio & his flamethrower is silly & unnecessary, but so what--I didn't mind that. Tarantino's allowed to be silly.What I find unforgiveable, and why I'm giving the movie such a low rating, is either or both of two things:\n(1) There is no proper ending, especially no followthrough on the DiCaprio-Pitt relationship. Pitt is wheeled off in an ambulance, DiCaprio's invited in next door by Sebring & Tate, and that's IT?!! I could barely believe my eyes that there was no more movie. DiCaprio says to Pitt in Italy that their relationship is over, they're supposed to have one final drunken blowout together, they do have the blowout, then Pitt saves DiCaprio's life and his wife's life, and... pffft, no more story?! I was fully expecting there to be one more scene, like in the hospital the next day. Either DiCaprio still plans to end the friendship, or he changes his mind in light of what just so dramatically happened, or he's so shallow he still doesn't change his mind, or maybe Pitt dies, or SOMETHING. It seems like a real cheat in storytelling to deprive us of a followup scene between the two of them. But even a scene without Pitt, where DiCaprio is just partying on with Tate, Sebring, & crew like nothing had happened, would've given us some sort of ending, some sort of footnote to how soulless DiCaprio has been all along. Instead, he just walks through the gate, and bam! movie's over.\n(2) One of the rules of alternative history is that you're supposed to give the reader/viewer some sense of how the world might or might not have been changed, if critical events had been different. Or at least some emotional shift in their understanding of those events. Now, the Manson murders were, of course, not the only thing that brought the end of the 1960s counterculture hopes & dreams. Obviously the assassinations of Robert Kennedy & Martin Luther King, Altamount, the deaths of Hendrix & Joplin, etc., were also very important. But the Manson murders DID have a huge influence on Hollywood society and the future of movie making. Read Sam Wasson's well-researched _The Big Goodbye_ if you don't know what I'm talking about. I credit Tarentino with knowing about the impact of those murders. So I really resent his not putting in any emotional payoff, or shift in emotional tone, or SOMETHING, to reflect how things might have been different--or else might not have been different after all--to indicate that he knows, and the older viewer surely knows, that he's made a consequential choice there. Even a cynical nothing-would-have-been-different ending would have been better than no ending at all.I say \"either or both\" of those things, because if EITHER the fictional story OR the alternative history story OR both, had delivered an ending, I would've been plenty satisfied. Instead, I was left feeling like my emotions had been toyed with, to no point. Any story that just stops in mid-flow, that doesn't deliver an ending, is really annoying to me. So for me, as a longtime Tarantino fan and someone knowledgeable about 1969, this movie is a HUGE misfire. It's not just disappointing: it's downright infuriating.", "I'm sure they had a good time making the movie": "Ugh...well, just finished the three hour tour. The first half was disappointing waiting for Tarantino to begin his signature blood bath. Finally when the killing began, the two senior couples out on a double date were aghast, perhaps they weren't familiar with Quentin's previous movies. Will I watch this one again? Probably not. It doesn't come close to 'Inglorious;, 'Pulp Fiction' nor 'Hateful Eight' - all of which I've seen countless times and will continue to watch in the future.", "whats with the dirty feet overkill?": "As a period piece - it is epic. a movie that attempts show us how it must have looked during the golden days of hollywood. wardrobe, houses, cars, music, everything was magical to me. the storyline however im not so sure. and can i just say, who has foot fetish in this movie? too many dirty feet scenes for my liking. was there actually apoint to those? am i missing something?", "2 hours and 40 minutes I'll never get back !": "If you've rated anything more than a 4 to this movie, I probably haven't seen the same film as you...

Feel free to walk out anytime. You won't miss anything. This is just a rambling sequence of insignificant vignettes that require a voice over to tie it together. There is no story and I didn't care about the characters. I wish I'd walked out.", "Don't Get Your Hopes Up": "I am a huge fan of Pitt, DiCaprio, Robbie and Tarantino. I have been looking forward to seeing this film since it was announced.That being said, I cannot understand how Pitt received the Best Actor Academy Award. DiCaprio was better. Pitt's character was better and most interesting, however DiCaprio's acting was FAR superior.The movie was long and Tarantino really used wishful thinking at the end changing history again ala Inglorious Basterds.Overall I was disappointed with this film. :/", "I can't believe I couldn't finish it.": "Movie was not interesting, no emotion, no plot, no continuity. I am not a person who wastes time so I stopped watching it and changed the TV to the sports channel. I am Tarantino's fan but no one in the world wastes my time.", "Fictionalizing History Plays On Fears, But Overlong At Times": "I had no idea what the movie was about, going into it. If DiCaprio wasn't starring I might have turned it off in the first 5 minutes, but stuck with it and was glad I did, as the beginning is not representative of what follows.For anyone who lived through the 60s in LA and was old enough to know what was going on, this film will strike nostalgic notes, including hearing the old KHJ radio ditty. Tarantino really reproduced the era in just about every way.The film follows DiCaprio's character home - an actor with some success - winding up the Hollywood Hills, turning on to Cielo Drive. This was my first hint of where we were going, knowing the house Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski rented was on Cielo. And sure enough, DiCaprio turns in next door.Soon we are treated to small, sporadic scenes of Tate and others in the months previous to the Manson murders, and Tarantino does something sweet in that we are able to follow Tate through an endearing afternoon - again fictionalized - but for those who only know her by her tragic death, it was an extremely powerful sequence in its joyful innocence.As the story progresses we see small interactions between Brad Pitt (who plays DiCaprio's stunt double in the film) and Manson characters... and when Pitt offers a hitcher a ride home to Spahn Ranch, and decides to take a gander around to check on his old friend Charlie Spahn who owns the place, I found myself racking my brain trying to remember if a stunt man was part of history. Again the suspense was Hitchcockian in scenes like this, and Pitt was superb.In this way Tarantino was able to play off people's fears - often brilliantly - while fictionalizing the past, changing history, especially in the movie's climax. Pitt and DiCaprio both gave stellar performances.In true Tarantino fashion, however, the film was overlong and had whole sections that could have been cut entirely, making it drag at times, and for way too long.That said, his films always have that element of brilliance and this one is no different, though I do have to wonder if the film's ratings were helped by a climax the world would have much preferred over history.", "Not is best.but still better than most": "Well it's Tarantino as we know and love. Great casting .. brad and leo are convincing enough as long time working buddies who socialise after and before work..drink get stonned and enjoy life together...

BIG names.... and then nothing...Who will give me back these three hours from my life?", "Tarantino's Love Letter To Hollywood!": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019) is a very unique and tasteful film by legendary director Quentin Tarantino. Personally, I am not the biggest fan of Tarantino's work. HIs debut film Reservoir Dogs still remains on top for me. But this movie, although is long, dry, and story-wise unattractive, it makes it up with other aspects. The first part being the scenery and the setting of this film. Getting to see Hollywood stories is something that movies do not do enough. There is a reason why Sunset Boulevard and Singing in the Rain remain classics to this day. People love Hollywood stories. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie also make this movie very special. They are all three amazing in their roles and pull this movie all together and make it a treat to us fans.If you are looking for a movie with a captivating story then do not consider this movie. However, if an enjoyable time filled with Hollywood's legendary stars and a Hollywood adventure is what you are after... then seek no further!", "some good moments": "The best part was about Brad Pitt's (ex) wife and the car of that lousy director's wife. Some other enjoyable moments too. Its a pity that I don't dig at all his violent scenes.", "Did I watch the same movie? (contains spoilers)": "I am normally too critical of movies so I am just as guilty as those of you who gave this movie a non-favorable rating.\nI put off seeing this movie for so long because I read the negative reviews on this site. Well I finally watched the movie and I wish I had watched it sooner. I loved this movie! Sure it was slow in parts but the acting was amazing and I love the story it told with regards to Rick Dalton feeling like a has-been and then re-discovering his passion for acting. I also love the friendship between Rick and Cliff. The retro scenes are so cool and I enjoyed watching Rick while filming tv shows and movies within the movie. I got a feel for how movies are made behind the scenes. The true story about the way the Manson family attack went down with regards to Sharon Tate has always disturbed me so much so that I don't like to think about it and I was fearing that would be on display in this movie but what a cool twist they put on it!!Anyhow, I guess that is something that makes this world great in that there is something for everyone. In one person's eyes, a movie really hits them in the right place and they love it and in another's, it is not appealing at all.\nWith that said, I get it, maybe many of you did not love this movie like I did, but come on people, 1/10???. I wonder sometimes if this site is just constantly hacked and people throw out those negative reviews without even watching the movie.So, let's agree to disagree I guess.\nI highly recommend this movie.", "Holy hell that was one long boring movie": "My wife decided to abort mission half way through, and I should have as well. The last scene was quintessential gory Tarantino, but predictably laughable.", "Missing Plot": "Pitt and DiCaprio had too little to work with. Margot's time was near useless. Almost walked out. There were only four instances in a 2.75 hour movie where the crowd had any reaction. Sorry to say catch it on Netflix.", "Too Long": "Great movie with a brilliant story. Also an orgie of well produced and smart scenes and I really love the grading in it. Well it have everything you can expect from Tarantino with a good amount of great smart humor. However the movie could be 90 minutes. Its way tooooooo long. I actually felt a sleep and woke up and they were still in same nonsens scene. This is why I gave it a 6. Its not the best Tarantino but still a story you bring with you home, even the day after you saw it you still have it with you. Its like brewing a red wine the quality grows. But it dosent even the fact its way toooo ZZZZZzzzzz. Btw the dog in last scene turns out to be a male and rest of movie its a bad. Just fun facts.", "A typical Tarantino.": "Women's feet, unique characters and bloody endings.If you enjoyed previous movies made by Tarantino, you will most certainly enjoy this one.", "3 hours of my life... gone.": "What did I just watch? The only reason I even gave this movie a 3 was for the production design and cinematography. The writing was-dare I say-boring. And confusing. If it was supposed to be an homage to 60's Hollywood, it completely missed its mark. It was three mismatched tales badly stitched together against a backdrop of the infamous Manson murders, and none of the storylines really worked. It was if QT were just rambling on, filling a notebook with ideas for scenes and not bothering to see if they told a story or not. Imagine taking 1000 pieces from ten jigsaw puzzles and trying to scotch-tape them together to form a picture. That's what this film was.And, Leo, if you happen to read this, please don't ever try to do a southern drawl ever again.", "Brad Pitt Stole The Show": "This movie is not very unique or anything remotely interesting. And the movie in the end just doesn't make me care that much of seeing more.", "Knowledge of actual events is what makes this movie": "This movie is by far neither the worst, or the best movie ever. But I think knowing the true story of Sharon Tate and Charles Manson creates a different experience when watching this move. I kept waiting for something terrible to happen at the ranch. Tarantino is genius at creating that type of tension. But if you aren't familiar with Charles Manson and his followers, you would have no context of how deranged they were. As far as the ending, well the title of the movie tells you this is a fairy tale. I was on the edge of my seat wondering how Tarantino was going to deal with the murders. The turn of events was so surprising, and so satisfying that I found myself cheering on that dog, and finally, seeing Sharon in the final scene was a bit gut wrenchingly sad as to what might have been.I had no trouble watching this movie for almost 3 hours.", "That was amazing!!!": "That scene towards the end, I wanted to yell out in excitement but it was 5am and I don't think they would share my enthusiasm. Fantastic all around. Everyone will get a kick out of this movie.", "Amazing cast but disappointing script": "I wanted to enjoy this movie so much mainly due to the incredible cast! But unfortunately it fell far short of my expectations, the story line was hollow and the characters didn't seem to be as exciting and watchable as previous Qt movies ( Brad Pitt not included)! Ironically unlike the film I'll cut to the chase, acting was brilliant cast were amazing but the script and story line let this movie down", "Quentin Tarantino ages like wine": "Well, first things first: this movie isn't for everyone. When you see this movie, expecting and hoping for another Pulp Fiction, you'll be disappointed. Pulp Fiction is a young Tarantino film, where he felt he needed a fast pace and lots of things happening on screen to make an impact. Once Upon a Time is completely different. And, maybe because just like Tarantino I am getting older, I think it's a better movie.Once Upon a Time takes us back to 1969 Hollywood. And when I say \"takes us back\" I mean that we might as well have driven our Delorian straight to the late 60's Hills. In true Tarantino fashion, every little detail is authentic, everything you see and hear adds to a sense of actually being there, in Hollywood, together with all the other people, trying to find fame and fortune. Or, in case of the many Flower Girls we see wandering the streets, some purpose or guidance.We meet Rick Dalton, brilliantly portrayed by Leonardo Di Caprio, an over the top western-actor, full of self-doubt, unsure whether he still has a future in Hollywood and his stunt double and best friend Cliff Booth, an enigmatic performance by Brad Pitt. We follow the pair as they start working on the tv-show 'Lancer', Dalton as the Bad Guy, the only roles he still lands and Booth, after pleading with the gaffer, as his stunt double. We also meet Dalton's neighbours, Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate, hands down Margot Robbie's best performance on the white screen as of yet.Yes, the threat that is Charles Manson is prevalently present, despite him being on screen for just 1 minute or so. We see the Flower Girls roaming the streets everywhere when we take a ride with our main characters and when Cliff Booth actually gives one of them a ride to Spahn Ranch, we can almost taste the tension that emanates from the place and it's occupants, not in the least from the Flower Girl in charge, a hauntingly cold Dakota Fanning.Tarantino keeps the spotlight on our sympathetic duo, slowly building up to the grand finale, the night of august 8th and then rewrites history, making Once Upon a Time the melancholic masterpiece that it really is. Not only does this movie take us back to simpler, better times, it celebrates true friendship and, most importantly, creates a fiction that is so much easier to stomach than the reality that we know.A must see, quite possibly Tarantino's best.", "Great acting, good film!": "A typical Tarantino movie, which is a good thing. The film itself is a good watch and although a little slow at times speeds up in the last 30 minutes to a explosive finally. But the film get extra stars for the great performances by both Di Caprio and Pitt, they truly are great at what they do and is worth watching for this alone.", "Best Film": "Great Film, Automatic Classic.Tarantino has managed to create one of the finest pictures of our time and it has seemingly gone under radar since it's incredible year of release.It takes a few times to appreciate the film for what is, as it took me three. First time, I was so overwhelmed when I was watching the new Tarantino film with Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCarpio that I fell sleep. I went to see the film again at the cinema and loved it but I still needed to see it three times, so I went to the cinema again and I was just amazed, I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks. It really had an affect on me and I'll never forget. I've watched it hundreds of times since and it'll always be in my top 3 list because that feeling will only happen a few times in your life.", "Really?? Boring....": "Who is reviewing this movie? I can't believe how boring this movie was. Was it supposed to be good just because Tarentino, DeCaprio and Pitt's names were involved in it. It truly was a waste of a good Saturday night. We kept waiting for there to something substantial to the movie. When you finally get to the finale it was comical instead of compelling. I wouldn't waste your money on this one, it will be on TV soon enough and you can at least fall asleep to it.", "need to be watched at least twice": "Watched this at the movies, left a bit scratching my head, have watched it 10 times since, an absolute masterpiece.,.", "Not for all": "This movie is a card of love from tarantino to the movies from his childhood so dont think that this is a pulp fiction,django,kill bill etc. This is the most personal film from tarantino", "GOAT": "Tarantinos best film! The man has never made a bad film and really is getting better. I can understand why he wants to call it quits at 10. So much nuance and brilliance. I heard he wrote a full season of Bounty Law. This is how much detail he puts into his character development. Going to read the novel next.", "One of the worst!": "I just can't believe how these famous names accepted to play on this script! I will not believe imdb points anymore.", "Just Di Caprio and Pitt.": "There is nothing interesting in that picture but the fabulous performances of Leonardo di Caprio and Brad Pitt.", "Nostalgic Emotion and Genuine Entertainment": "Set in late 60s California, Quentin Tarantino's most recent picture \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" places audiences in a slow starting and fast finishing wholistic two hour film.A piece created for its time the movie matches washed up has beens and ambitious wannabe's in a time where the world around them is becoming less about that \"golden\" Hollywood lifestyle.Tarantino's unique directing style shines through with long drawn out simple scenes and conversation dialogue that actually feels like something two people would be talking about in ways that two people might actually be talking to each other. Like most conversations in passing, some may not be as particularly interesting as others, but throughout the film this adds a much needed layer of realism to a time period that is normally sensationalized at every instance in its reflection of cinema. Additionally the story is relatively straightforward due to the assist of its alignment with the terrible Manson family event that happened that fateful day in 1969.For personal enjoyment I was left pleased when the film was over that my captivation in the moment was not lost or interrupted by anything a character on screen did. Actions felt warranted and words felt real in what is a testament to both the actor and Tarantino's writing himself.While falling short of his previous greats like \"Hateful Eight\" and \"Inglourious Basterds\", \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" successfully evokes nostalgic emotion and provides genuine entertainment in a realistic and exciting thoughtful slice of life.-Jim Score: 7.3/10", "It's a Tarantino!": "The amount of small details in this Tarantino Masterpiece is sheer incredible. To redesign the Sunset Strip to give it a 1960 look left me sit with my mouth wide open wondering how did they do it? The Storyline was awesome, surprisingly unique and the acting was spot on. Pitt and diCaprio have once again shown what perfectionism in a movie means. Robbie, Hirsch, Fanning, Olyphant, the late Perry and Pacino rounded off this masterpiece of film history with dignity. Bravo Mister Tarantino, bravo! 161 Minutes of pure excitment. This is definately a 9 Star rated movie for me and for sure one of my favorite Tarantino movies. I highly recommend this movie to everybody.", "Tarantino at his funniest...": "Don't get me wrong, it's flawed, but it's so much fun. What the plot lacks, the acting, cinematography, and dialogue make up for. The world that Tarantino created is so fun to explore, and is full of detail. This isn't perfect, and it sure isn't Tarantino's best, but it's still a great movie.", "Great sense of atmosphere and attitude.": "An increasingly irrelevant television actor, Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his out of work stunt double, Cliff Booth (Pitt) strive to achieve fame and success in the film industry as Hollywood's Golden Age comes to an end. Tarantino crafts yet another masterclass in classic film making technique and ever engaging dialogue in this stylish revisionist history of 1960s L.A.Tarantino is without a doubt one of the most skilful directors working today and he surrounds himself with a very talented cast and crew who are all working brilliantly in this his ninth film. The cinematography by Robert Richardson strikes a clever balance between modern camera movement and a more classical filmmaking style paying homage to films from the 50s and 60s with plenty of long wide takes showing off the wonderful work from production designer Barbara Ling and costume designer Arianne Phillips. The design feels both stylish and tactile, Tarantino's preference for real sets, cars and props over CGI environments gives the film's setting weight and character which perfectly captures the feeling of Hollywood in this era. Edited by Fred Raskin the film clocks in at 161 minutes. It doesn't strictly follow a traditional three act structure and often indulges in scenes which do little to advance the plot or characters, but despite the slower pace it is consistently entertaining.The acting on display is all excellent as you would expect from such an A-list cast. DiCaprio brings a lot of charisma to a mean and self-obsessive alcoholic. Pitt manages to make his character likeable despite being lazy and violent with a questionable past. If those characters show the fall of the Golden Age of Cinema Margot Robbie in her small role as Sharon Tate represents a more innocent and romanticised past for Hollywood, something authentically optimistic. These characters have little in the way of character growth and Tarantino avoids making judgement on their motivations and actions thus the film functions more as a well-crafted snapshot of old Hollywood and is less a story about characters or theme.The film will not be to everyone's taste, it is long and slow paced, it doesn't have a typical protagonist versus antagonist dynamic, and it doesn't offer satisfying character arcs. There is also the trade-mark Tarantino violence which is always a point of contention for audiences. But it is a highly entertaining, expertly crafted unique film that draws you into its world with a great sense of atmosphere and attitude.", "Don't listen to bad reviews": "I really enjoyed the movie and I didn't find it boring like they said ... I liked the classic era that was in the first 2 hours of the movie .. well done by Tarantino .. The end of the movie was ok .. could be written in more good way but it's ok.\nBrad Pitt and Leonardo di Caprio were amazing due ! well done !!", "A fairy tale Tarantino style": "Before watching the movie, it's necessary that you research a little about the Sharon Tate murder and the Manson Family. If you don't do that, you won't completly understand and appreciate this film.\nThe movie is really slow most of the time, in order for you to submerge in the 60's ambientation, and to grow fond with the characters. But if you like Tarantino and good cinema, you will be delighted with it.\nDi Caprio and Brad Pitt are stunning as always, nothing more to say about them. Margot plays perfectly the angelical role of Sharon Tate, a nice homage to her.", "Sucks big time!!!": "What's is this? Maybe you need to be huge Hollywood fan or live off the BS materialistic talk about the Hollywood stars, their clothes, perfumes, and most of all, their gossip. This movie is shallow and superficial as no other movie is ir has ever been. You add to the fact that there is no plot and you end up wasting three hours of your valuable time and money.And the end, the typical gore and carnage so characteristic of QT's movies...

I wouldn't even watching it on dvd, as it's very disappointing movie", "Good but awful": "QT has lost his way...what a disjointed mess. The great actors were great but it lacked cohesion...even in the QT way. Great cinematography of course...but overall it was almost boring. Best character was Cliff's dog!", "One of Brad Pitt's best performance": "Brad was amazing, so as Leonardo, credit for sure goes to QT, I always think it is the director who can get out the best out of an actor or an actress, oh my God I was laughing loud in some scenes! Both Leo and Brad made me happy!!! I would not say this is QT best movie! As still PULP FICTION is the best! But the most I like about this movie is that I felt time passed without noting I spend nearly 3 hours on my chair!!! Wow a masterpiece works and specially creating sixties atmosphere all around! Credit to everyone worked in this move, casting, decoration, camera men....etc! As usual! You will never get out disappointed by QT films! He is a genius", "Boring, disjointed, too long (as ever, from QT), what was all the fuss about??": "After hearing so many good things about this flick, the actual experience of watching it was a massive let down. It has a rambling, incoherent story line, is just boring for long stretches as nothing really happens and I just don't care about any of the characters enough to care whether they come out of the film well or not. The 'twist' at the end, whereby the Manson hippies enter Dalton's house not the Tate house, is just weird but I suppose QT had to try to inject some sort of 'big' ending to this bore fest didn't he. Oh yes, Dalton would definitely have been allowed to take home a flame thrower from the set wouldn't he...Worst QT film by far in my view. A mess of epic proportions that is not worthy of the great man.", "Scenes longer than they needed to be.": "Some beautiful shots with superb actors but some scenes dragged on longer than they should have. Good movie though. Enjoyed.", "One of the worst climaxes I have ever seen. Rest of the movie is great.": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is an interesting movie.Leonardo DiCaprio of course does a magnificent job, as always. Brad Pitt is also really good in this film. I don't remember a single bad, not even mediocre performance. As far as the acting goes, no problem here.Cinematography is great, the dialogue is fantastic. The comedy in this movie is really funny. The tone of the movie is light-hearted and you don't take this movie too seriously. The movie is never boring either. There's not too much violence, even though there's tension, maybe not in the traditional Tarantino way.Which brings me to the worst part about this movie, the climax. It stuck out so much from the rest of the movie. It was really hard to take the scene seriously, or as a funny moment, when there's a woman screaming at the top of her lungs, a dog biting somebody's nuts off, People being hit against walls, blood everywhere, etc. I was left with such a bad taste in my mouth after the movie. I didn't remember almost any of the prior scenes before I looked them up.A great comedy with great characters, great dialogue, really good on a technical level. The climax was just exceptionally bad.", "I Love Quentin Movies...This One Not So Much": "I LOVE Quentin Tarantino movies! I couldn't wait until this movie came out. Unfortunately, this movie turned out to be a disappointment. The cast did well but the plot was muddled and the movie felt, and fell, flat.", "A movie full of stereotypes and with not much happening...": "When I first came out of the movie, I felt like it was a pretty decent movie. There was good suspense at certain parts of the movie and we got to see a lot of late 60s retro along with very good acting. But the more I think about it, the more I'm realising the lack of depth and actual content. Don't get me wrong, I love Tarantino. but this movie felt much like a show off of how much Tarantino knows about film history. Most of the movie felt like pointless plot lines that didn't end up anywhere and exist for no other reason but to show off nostalgia. There were only a few \"actual scenes\", which to be fair were very good.A couple scenes do not make a movie though. All in all, characters were very shallow and didn't develop at all, except for Leonardo's character a tiny bit. The characters were very one-dimensional and mainly reinforced old stereotypes. Such stereotypes include the ditsy, air-headed, blonde Sharon Tate, the tough, confident chauffeur/kind of bodyguard Cliff, the annoying, stupid hippies and the laughable Asian (in this case Bruce Lee!). All characters are only there for one specific purpose and we don't learn much about the characters.In this way, it feels like this movie takes a step back in how Hollywood has been progressing. Shallow, stereotypical characters with no development are something of the past. I understand that this is a movie set in the late 60s, but that doesn't mean that it has to be written with those values in mind.On another note, I don't want to turn this into a \"social justice warrior\" kind of thing, but I greatly took offence with how Bruce Lee was portrayed in this movie. Mocking a legendary Martial Artist who has passed away is in bad taste. Imagine if a movie depicted Muhammad Ali being beaten by some random character in an unimportant side scene, or if Robin Williams was casually used as the butt of a joke. Both of these would be very unacceptable. The only reason I can think of why Bruce Lee's case seems to be acceptable to the press is because Asian actors tend to be comedic reliefs most of the time. They mostly play ridiculous characters (e.g. Ken Jeong in Hangover) and when there are strong Asian characters, white actors are casted for that. As a result, when the first famous Asian actor, who didn't play this self-mocking role, is mocked, it seems to be normal to everyone. But if we imagine mocking for instance a legendary, now-dead African-American actor, or mocking an African tradition, that would be unacceptable.All in all, I give this movie 2 stars because of its lack of depth and its very weak, clicheed characters. I will say that the movie has some great scenes with excellent suspense, but as mentioned above a few scenes don't make a movie.", "A declaration of love to Sharon Tate": "All the negatives reviews come from people which have no clue about the facts happening in those days to Roman Polansky's wife and her friends.

On a sidenote, recent Golden Globe winner, Austin Butler from \"Elvis\" plays a bad guy in this movie, which is highly surprising when you look back at this movie!My only problem with this movie is that it is too long, certain scenes, especially the Western movie set scene should've been edited down by Quentin Tarantino to make this a more palatable 2 hour movie!Enjoy!Brad Pyner\nCleveland, Ohio.", "Awful and boring": "People who are saying this is a great or even a good movie are to poosh to have an opinion of their own cause no way so many could liked it.

Controversial as it is!!This film will divide viewers. The first 2 hours are devoted to late 60s cinema and the final 20-30 mins is classic Tarantino where he twists you then turns your world upside down. Unfortunately I can't divulge how he does this as it will spoil it for you!!DiCaprio puts on an absolute acting masterclass as an ageing actor struggling with becoming irrelevant in a changing movie industry. Brad Pitt plays his stunt double and overall best buddy. Although he plays second fiddle he is still great.The film bends around the Manson Family Murders and Margot Robbie is majestic as Sharon Tate.Quite a few laughs plus a great scene with Bruce Lee which was really enjoyable.As always plenty of dialogue but not as much as you might expect.In terms of a review I found it a little slow early but with some great effects injecting the actors into old 60s movies such as The Great Escape.The last act you will either love or hate. It's full of action, over the top and generally awesome. However, I'm not a fan of it! The movie needed the ending as it occurred otherwise the rest of the film served no purpose.

Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth are both heroes here, and they save the life of the beautiful Sharon Tate in the end--along with a house full of her friends. What a story Tarantino has made!There are other storylines woven together and each is wonderful; there is humor and there is pathos and not a dull moment for me.

The characters were well made and they never bored me. One scene was so intense I literally got excited way more than I ever did before and the character was badass so thanks for the excitement. That character also made another badass move when it was close to the end and he's my favourite one out of all. The story was progressing and had a little bit of this and a little bit of that but I still liked what was in it.

I've read Helter Skelter and I looked forward to the big ending. It didn't go as expected just like inglorious Bs. I expected the unexpected and was disappointed. Knowing what to expect ruined the movie for me. I was waiting for that final scene and when the movie ended I asked myself, \"what was the point of this movie?\" It had so much potential, but seriously the Manson gang was somehow so underdeveloped I was just disappointed with what could have been. It's an original script, but I almost wish it had been two separate films. I would have loved a Tarantino Manson film and I would have loved a film about Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth. However I think, the dalton/booth story was secondary to me because I wanted more Manson family the first time I watched it. The second time I watched it I wanted more Dalton/Booth and no Manson story. Somehow I didn't get enough of either in 3 hours, how is that possible?I enjoyed the film, I think it was great. I just wish I had more I guess maybe that's the point. Maybe one day there will be a sequel and we will get to see where Cliff/Dalton go and Manson and his gang come back for more. I hope there will be more because I will never be satisfied with what I got. There was absolutely no closure to the film. This Is the first review I have written so take it or leave it. I recommend seeing the film, but I hope you go in with no knowledge of the history behind it so that you will get the most out of it.Plus the Bruce Lee fight was worth the price of admission, and if that wasn't enough the DiCaprio seen with him yelling at himself for forgetting his lines was pure gold. Following that up with him crying over being a called a good actor was unbelievable directing/film artistry/acting. I loved it! I just think it gets lost in all the other world/story building scenes. All of the Margot Robbie scenes felt underdeveloped or pointless. What's the point of hiring her to act if she's just there to be nice and look pretty, let that woman shine with some interesting dialogue like everyone else.", "Finally found a movie to fall asleep to": "Don't waste your time or money! Watch titanic it's way better than this movie!", "Another Tarantino's success": "My real vote is 8.5, but i prefer add 9.0 because is Tarantino. There is not much to add, interesting film, real, true, legendary interpretation from Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio, long, so fantastic, my first vote was 8.0, but the final changed all the dishes on the table, ah, you can not speak of the beautiful Margot Robbie, at the end, see the 60's is wonderful. Eccelent job Tarantino as always!", "(Serious spoiler, suggested to read the article after viewing the film)": "(Serious spoiler, suggested to read the article after viewing the film)First of all, a statement of position, I was Quentin was originally a fan, then ordinary fans, now become passers-by. QT has gone downhill since the last long film, the Eight Evil One, which lasted 182 minutes, is far less narrative and Quentin-style than it was before.The Hollywood Past is no exception. The film lasts 162 minutes, and the narrative is even worse than the previous Eight Evil One.To begin with, the first time you know QT want to film the story starts with the news: QT want to remake the story of Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski, fans should know the story better. My initial expectation of QT the new film was that the story would be adapted into a QT-style action film and could then contain elements of suspense and B film, which should be enough for a fan.But the whole movie is so weird that many characters don't know what it means to be there.First of all Sharon Tate this is supposed to be the most important role. When she went to the cinema to see her own film, she put her foot up on the front chair and QT shot her foot all the time, making me think that the meaning of Sharon Tate was to satisfy QT fetish about Margot Robbie.And then there's the well-deserved Charles Manson of the character, which, by reason, is the main character. The result is not, the most surprising is that the Manson is played by Damon Herriman, unknown, and manson this role in the play only once, about two minutes of the play, people can not understand.Then the Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, roles of Leonardo and Brad Pitt were even more surprising, first showing that both characters were fictional character, meant to be non-existent, and then the whole film, two hours and 42 minutes, two hours of the story of the two men, verbose and confusing, especially Cliff bragging about Pierce's nest, I really do n' t know what Quentin's doing.Then there is the discussion of the Bruce Lee plot, first QT exaggerating the Bruce Lee accent, and the real Bruce Lee muscle content does not know how much more than the play, and then by Cliff this fictional character to degrade Bruce Lee, is also confusing.The next step is what you call \"30 minutes worth the fare back.\" First I say, these 30 minutes are not worth the fare back. If you've seen QT past movies, you do n' t think the 30 minutes are much better. Although the 30 minutes are really good compared to the work of the ordinary director, they can only be ordinary to QT, even his work", "if you are younger than 40, you will be bored": "I am not a fan of western or celebrities lifestyle or hippies or 70s lifestyle, or feet fetish (really why to put 3 or 4 scenes with girls putting up dirty feet on seats, windows,...)\nWas not able to watch it till the end", "What it lacks in action, it makes up for in acting and writing": "When I first left the theater I was admittedly a little underwhelmed by the lack of Tarantino's trademarked action and gore but upon multiple revisitings of film I know exactly what it's supposed to be and that makes it.Fundamentally this movie is about cinema from the 60s, specifically the late 60s of Quentin's youth. From the studio politics of movies to the up and coming 70s style of filmmaking.This film shows a behind the scenes aspect of Hollywood life from the late 60's and it absolutely strikes the mark. Rick Dalton is a very interesting character who definitely embodies Quentin and his current perspective but also that of a studio actor. Knowing that they peaked long ago but are still a bankable name to rely on. There is a very vulnerable side of Leo that we see. He goes from a stuttering has-been to a stern western villain seamlessly. And Cliff Booth is a hilariously Zen character who is equally at peace with his environment at all times and also completely aware of his surroundings and the consequences of his actions.Combine these aspects with the historic Manson murders and you get a quintessential Tarantino period piece.Additionally I will say that it is very clear that this Sally Menke didn't edit this film but it still shines bright nevertheless. If anything I feel like this movie was made not to be editted by MenkeThough slow at times, this film shows that Quentin is not done with filmmaking.", "Tarantino' s big work is big": "Many people didn't like this movie and thought it was boring. That means they don't see the beauty. You can feel the 70s in this movie. The props, how people act and habits are very 70s like.

There it is, very well. At the same time, there are strategies for pairing stories in parallel. Editing is awesome, Los Angeles in the sixties was masterfully crafted, but there was something missing!What are those?I did not find anything comparable to the unforgettable scenes of Pulp Fiction.\nViolence is much less, though, when it comes to Tarantino style! Everyone laughed at the characters' plight.\nThe first half of the film is quite slow, but everyone knew something will happen. But the time until the original suspension of the second half was made is quite frustrating.\nMore attention has been paid to Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. The powerful side character in Tarantino's cinema is not here. Although there were attractive characters like director Roman Polanski and Cult leader Charles Manson, he didn't show them at all. .What are the good things?The conversation with Leonardo DiCaprio at a little girl's shooting spot was both fun and touching best scene in the movie. Brads scary appearance Manson's ranch was top notch. And I got the classic Tarantino in the Humor Violence of the End scenes.The people who watch this movie have a little clue about Charles Manson. But Polanski's wife has something to do with it, which is not shown in the movie, but if you know the thing, you'll have more fun.Caprio did a wonderful job. Brad Pitt found his the character he suited best.\nSo, how did it all feel? Will not fall into Tarantino's best work, nothing is iconic, but there has been a good movie.

The film was able to immerse the viewer in this setting by creating detailed and era appropriate sets. Because of this it was awarded the Oscar for Best Production Design in the most recent Academy Awards ceremony.The viewer is also immersed in the 1969 Los Angeles because of the soundtrack that was chosen for the film. Tarintino selected era appropriate songs and the songs that were chosen for specific scenes appropriately fit with the ongoing narrative.Tarintino, once again is able to write dynamic characters. For the majority of the narrative, we follow the duo of Rick Dalton, an actor, and Cliff Booth, Rick's stuntman. The story also follows Sharon Tate, an actress from the 1969. Unlike Cliff Booth, and Rick Dalton, Sharon Tate was a real person from the 60's.

The ending is a slap in the face for all who know what really happened. For about 20 minutes of the movie, I wondered if it was still raining outside and if I had turned off the curling iron. I feel contempt for the reviewers who felt they had to kiss up to Tarantino in order not to be hit with the wrath of this unpleasant egomaniac, who self importantly ordered the Cannes audience not to reveal the ending as if his colossal bore were a Kubrick.

Otherwise none of it makes sense.You'd think in a film 2 hours and 41 minutes long they could explain a bit about who Charles Manson is and why killing his followers that night is significant.Classic self indulgent Hollywood that just assumed everyone knows the ins and outs of this story.Entertaining performances from Leo & Brad but no sign of a plot. Just a series of moments. It's a long film and yet they still need a narrator to tell us what's (not) going on. My brain is confused. What was that film.", "Nostalgic. Quirky. Entertaining.": "I would only change two things about this film;(1) Remove the narration. The story would be much more effective without it.(2) Extend the scenes that trigger the need for the narration, allowing the visuals to tell the story (challenging the audience to follow along). This is especially true for the set-up for the entire final act, which unfolds in a choppy and very heavy handed way (which forces Tarantino to use narration).Tarantino's choices to help shave 20 or 30 minutes from the running time definitely weakened the film. It's good to hear that he's working on an extended cut.Other than those complaints, I think this is by far Tarantino's BEST film. No, it doesn't break new ground in any major way but it's an easily accessible, terrifically acted film with wide audience appeal.Great directing. Outstanding soundtrack. Perfectly cast.", "Weak": "Cant believe tarantino directed this. I guess college education is necessary to understand bruce lee and what he stood for. The story could be told in under an hour.", "Best film by genius Quentin Tarantino": "Watching Once Upon A Time in Hollywood in 2019 was one of the best decisions ever and I so regret not watching it on the big screen. I have never loved the film the way I love once upon a a time in Hollywood. I have watched it for 15 times at least, if not more. Never getting tired of it. The only film that once can take place of OUATIH is Babylon by Damien Chazelle, but right now, OUATIH remains #1 on my list.Each performance by each actor is admirable and amazing. Even small roles. What a beautiful cinematography. Beautiful film about Hollywood in 60s.Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are obviously the greatest.But Margot Robbie proves, you don't need to have many lines in a film to develop a great performance. What an amazing portrayal of late Sharon Tate. And what makes her portrayal even more beautiful is what Debra Tate (Sharon's sister) said: \"She made me cry because she sounded just like Sharon, The tone in her voice was completely Sharon, and it just touched me so much that big tears started falling. The front of my shirt was wet. I actually got to see my sister again... nearly 50 years later.\"- Those words belong to Debra Tate and every time I remember it, I get chills all over my body.", "Great 60s retro feelings but not for everyone": "Obviously the story line is not as exciting as other QT films such as Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, but it has more subtlety in my opinion. It offers a detailed view of the 60s era, and it is down to the nuances in cars, hippies selling drugs, and even the dialogue.\nThe artistic expression is original, but it could also divide the audience. QT's aim to bring the sense of Hollywood's Golden Age to modern screen is well-achieved. But what the audience expect from this film does seem to influence the ratings. It would be unfair to say the slow pace plot is bad. Going deeper into the characters could possibly be the best way to capture the zeitgeist of the 60s.", "Slow mo with a big hit ending": "Once upon a time in Hollywood is a slow moving film that is only for 60's lovers and 80% of the film is something that won't watch back ever again .

It didn't feel tight and well polished like his other films in years past. It was sad to see a film from Tarantino that didn't live up to his name. This movie felt like a first draft. Again, there were some parts that were fantastic, however the momentum of anything good was killed by the incredibly slow and sluggish second act. It's worth seeing once, but not rewatchable in my opinion.", "Worst movie from QT": "Watched the movie with lot of patience but still it could not grasp my attention for 5 mins..waited for a plot to come..but it was too late.\nBrad Pitt on screen is the only grace from this film.", "Solid film from one of the greats": "I really like Tarantino's films. They ooze with style, the performances tend to be great, and the situations memorable. This is a good movie, but does not have as many of those moments that made his other films so.game changing.

And I enjoyed so many elements of it. But, personally, I found myself on a couple of occasions deep into the movie thinking \"where is this going\". I didn't feel a strong narrative guiding me through, rather a compilation of scenes (some entertaining) carrying little substance and not furthering the story.Yes the writing was good, the dialogue was good. But the characters just for me weren't as interesting as some other Tarantino films (take out Pitt and DiCaprio and you would notice that more). Personally, didn't think it stood up anywhere near close to Django; Despite a superb ending scene - but one jaw dropping scene can't rescue an entire movie.", "Quentin Tarantino's love letter to 1960's Hollywood": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is by far the slowest paced of Tarantino's movies, but as a lover of movies and the Golden age of Hollywood, that is one of the things I enjoyed most about the film, It is about the friendship between a has been actor trying to recapture his past glory and his stunt double who also functions as his driver and gofer, I love seeing behind the scenes of Hollywood movie making and there is a lot of that in this movie.The film is set in the months leading up to the Manson murders and therein lies the tension as we see the the main characters, played by Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio, living next door to Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski (This is one of those movies that is best watched for the first time spoiler free) - The Manson murders ended the innocence of Hollywood and the idealism of the 60's hippie culture, so going in I thought that was going to be the emotional impact of the movie, however in a surprise the ending twists into an alternate reality where the would be murderers walk into the house next door to Tate's and are themselves savagely and rather humorously killed by the main characters, the closing shot of Sharon Tate still alive is touching and emotional and leaves you wondering what her life would have been like if this ending had been reality.However, is the ending in good taste? - it is one thing to mess around with Hitler's history as Tarantino did in Inglorious Bastards - who cares about him? - but most everyone above a certain age knows what really happened to Sharon Tate and how brutally she was murdered, is it insulting to her memory to give her life a feel good Hollywood ending the way Tarantino did or will seeing the Manson Murderers getting their just deserts, even if it's in an alternate reality, be a catharsis for many? - That is still an open question for me and one that I am sure will be debated by movie watchers for a long time.", "Are we changing history here?": "Okay. My husband brought this home for us to watch on our 4k blu ray home theatre. We watched Ad Astra before this. I liked Ad Astra better. I like Brad Pitt. He's not my favourite actor, but I like him.

I don't smoke weed, I kind of follow my parent's habits more in that maybe I drink to much sometimes? I don't smoke. Okay...about the movie. There was a lot of talk about movie making.. but the first part was pretty boring, mostly about movie making in Hollywood. At some point someone mentions that Brad Pitt's character is supposed to have killed his wife.... so I'm supposed to care about him now?\nOkay.... well I did when I figure out Margot Robbie's character is supposed to be Sharan Tate, and then I hated that I was watching this movie, because it was going to be another blood soaked Tarantino festMostly I hate his movies. I frickin loved Dogs & Cats 2 Revenge of Kitty Galore and Happy Feet. I'm 56 years old.\nDoes anyone remember Manson? Do any of the reviewers know who we was? He was an a-hole who recruited people to kill innocent people for no reason. The story doesn't follow history. Sharon Tate died that night.... the guy mixing the Margaritas died... in this retelling they lived... It would have been nice if they had lived, but I don't need to see the bad guys mauled by a pit bull or have their faces bashed in repeatedly or torched to ashes...

The last part was cool but nothing in comparison to other scenes from Tarantino ( except for the flamethrower scene that was badass). There were no surprises, no unlikely turns and no suspense. I missed the blood oh God did I miss the blood. The violence ... the exaggerated violence which defines tarantino for me. The plot was aimless. You could say so was Pulp Fiction's but the difference is this: every scene of every character was enjoyable.Acting was great especially Leo's of course and Brad as Cliff was amazing. Sharon Tate's portrayal was also really accurate but it did not improve the plot. It could have led the plot in a very great direction but yeah.\nThe setting is beautiful and I really felt the 60's vibe.It could have been soooo much better.

On top of that, it had a stand out appalling depiction of the late, great Bruce Lee. Much was written in the media about it at the time as bad taste, inaccurate as to Bruce' character and racist. He depicts Bruce as cocky and a big mouth, saying he could beat another legend, the late boxer, Muhammad Ali in a fight. And then proceeds to lose in a fight to Brad Pitt's character.The scene greatly upset Bruce' daughter, with the audience laughing at her late father in a screening she attended. Tarantino insensitively responded to the backlash by maintaining it was an accurate portrayal. However, had he done a minimum of research, he'd know his portrayal was false and inaccurate. Bruce used to get challenged a lot, and avoided confrontation. He well recognised a Chinese boxer couldn't take on someone like Muhammad Ali- the latter would likely be able to \"kill him.\" Bad taste. Like the film generally.", "Seriously good": "This movie is fantastically yet disturbingly awesome. Quentin has done it again, but slightly differently than his other two masterpieces, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds. He weaves a tale that patiently depends upon two hours of character building and background setup before delivering an explosive forty-minute re-telling of a fateful night in Hollywood that delivers a hero in Brad Pitt's character that I will love forever... I hope you will too! Every background character deserves as many honors as the masterful Brad Pitt and the brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio.

Otherwise an overlong yarn which rewrites history.", "Cooler than an penguin in a freezer": "Loved this film. A stylised insight into what Hollywood in the late 60s was like. Grade A cast. Brad Pitt oozed charisma as the stuntman and DiCaprio as the actor who realised that his peak in the industry was behind him was was exemplary. The costume department for this film gets 5 stars as everyone just looked amazing! If you go in to this film unaware about Sharon Tates history, you may be nonplussed about this film and Robbie's role in it but the twist on the Manson family narrative made for a compelling watch. Tarantino on top of his game with usual top draw soundtrack. Took me back to a time ten years before I was born and loved every minute of it!", "The Golden Age of Hollywood": "\" Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" had some of the most impressive backdrops and props that anyone who lived during the 1960's will immediately fall in love with this film. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place back in 1969 when TV star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) take on the Hollywood life. Rick Dalton while meeting with Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino) in a bar, discusses the possibility that his acting career could be coming to a downwards slide. Throughout the movie these two movie stars push for success, and to experience everything that Hollywood's Golden Age has to offer in Las Angeles. The theme throughout this movie is the struggle to survive. Throughout this movie, stars Rick and Cliff continually talk about different moves they could make in Hollywood that would bring them both back into the spotlight and turn their career back in the right direction. This theme is similar in some ways to the theme in \"The Pursuit of Happiness\". The difference between these two movies is obvious. Quentin Tarantino takes a different twist on protagonists during his films. He never makes his characters out to be heroes, or anything similar. In \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\", Quentin shows the lifestyles of both Rick and Cliff during their struggles. He paints their characters to have mistake riddled pasts, with no intentions on improving their morals or lifestyles in the future.\nThe setting of this film is very accurate for the time period. The detail that was put into this films backgrounds and props especially made those who lived in the 1960's to fall in love immediately. \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" The entire set is made to look like it truly is 1960's in Hollywood. The houses, costumes, and even the commercials and advertisements are authentic to the time period. This adds to the drama of Rick and Cliff's struggle as they battle through obstacles that actors would have had to face in that time period. Aside from the background and props, the music and sounds used also take you back to a thriving 1960's LA California. One unique twist that Quentin Tarantino threw into the filming of this movie, is that he shot the movie with 35mm Anamorphic cameras. This added to the film feeling like it perfectly fit into the time period. Quentin wanted to film this movie with the same type of film that would have been used when filming movies back in the late 1960's. This added to the incredibly realistic setting that this movie was filmed in.\nIn the Golden Age of Hollywood many actors were fighting to make a name for themselves. This was a tough time to be an actor as everyone was competing for this promising career. Quentin Tarantino does a fantastic job of grasping the struggles and hardships an actor who thought he already had success, only to feel it start to slip right out of his hands would feel as he fought to keep his name in the spotlight.", "De Caprio and Pitt Teaming Up is all we need from a Masterpiece by Mr. Tarintino": "This movie is Spectacular , Di Caprio is at top of his Game and so is Brad Pitt and that Ending was A Top Notch one. Hats off to Mr. Director and another Masterpiece from him.", "Be prepped for being confused": "I know nothing about 60's Hollywood, so I can imagine how few references I got and how less I understood about the movie. For me subjectively it was definitely refreshing, creative, fun, great acting and cinematography, but I was really confused. The first two hours were a composition of scenes I often struggled to understand. But when you can't appreciate the history in a scene, or the reference (f.e. being in the movies watching Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) being in the movies watching Sharon Tate, and laughing for the actual joke the actual Sharon Tate did is f.e. a beautiful scene, but I don't know Sharon Tate at all, and I didn't get the layers immediately. So I just had a scene where Margot Robbie sat in the movies. Therefore I was a bit bored. lol.\nI think it definitely is a movie which you should give some time. The first impression may be a bit disappointing. But it is fun to sit through, and the ending is also some (very funny) action for the more clueless. However.", "Sensacional!": "Como tudo que Tarantino faz, \u00e9 sensacional! Metalingagem cinematogr\u00e1fica interessant\u00edssima do in\u00edcio ao fim. Vale a pena conferir.

Di Caprio and Pitt are really great actors. Also, there were these two minutes in the end when the whole sh***t came finally down on the characters: these two minutes were just hilarious.Also, Tarantino's idea to make everyone expect to see the Tate-massakar was a nice one.But other than that it was first of all: incredibly boring. Soooooo booooring. Not nearly as boring as The Hateful 8 - but sooooo incredibly boring anyway. Among other things probably also because Tarantino did obvoiulsy decide to pass on a dramaturgy almost altogether in this movie. So almost every scene was completely random and each could have been easily replaced with another one - it would have made no difference whatsoever.Then there was Tarantino's completely outdated depiction of men and women: it seems, for him females can be smart and bad-ass - just as long as they are not yet or not any more menstruating. All other female characters are only used by him as sex phantasies without any meaning, inner life, or thoughts.In this movie not one female character had any interesting storyline at all. Regarding female characters it just seemed (again) that Tarantino's mind is hopelessly stuck in the 90th - like he is having the mind of a very old, ancient guy.Unsually, Tarantino is the admirable king of film music. This time, even the music was not interesting at all and didn't do anything for the movie.In terms of directing, this entire movie was just a terribly sloppy thing.After his last two completely dispensable movies I think, Tarantino needs a nice, long break from directing. He is starting to become this sad Woody Allen figure: Allen should have stopped making his completely insignificant movies at least 25 years ago. But everyone has mercy enough to tolerate his obvious need to constantly make annoying and pointless movies anyway: as his little hobby because this is probably better for Allen than vegetating in a nurcing home.Let's hope, Tarantino has more self awareness than Allen.However lastly, since Tarantino gave us these stunning master pieces Inglorious Basterds and Django - I absolutely forgive him for his last to failiures.But please, Quentin, wait with your next movie until you have to say another great thing instead of nothing.", "Slow, Boring... Wait for Netflix": "I love Tarantino ... which is why it's hard for me to say this, but this movie kinda sucked.

Until the last 20 minutes of this lengthy film, I had no idea what was going on.But after re-watching, I realised that this really doesn't matter. The film is incredibly beautiful from start to finish, it is profoundly funny and clever, and the performances by the whole cast are incredible. Tarantino really took film making to the next level with this one. Love it!", "I was surprised but not in a good way": "I am been the biggest fan of Tarantino movies since the 90's. I wanted to see this movie so badly that I nagged all my friends endlessly to see it as soon as it came out. Now I'm embarrassed that I did that. I felt I had to apologize to them for taking them to a this movie. Every single movie he has ever made, he has built characters that you can invest in, that you care about. This is not the case with this movie. There is no story line or any time spent on any of the characters to any extent that you would care about them. The characters in past Tarantino's movies have always have a goal that each one was reaching for. It may be small or maybe large and/or insignificant but it was a goal. The characters in this movie seemed to be just floating. I think their biggest goal was driving around LA and having a beer at the end of the day. It starts to work when Leo's character talks to the child character about his place in acting but they don't take it any further. And the same with Brad Pitt's character who starts to feel anger toward the manson family but then it doesn't go any further. Everything just fizzles out. Hell I even started the care about the dog and I wish he was in the movie more. Take the dog to the manson ranch. I mean there is one gratifying scene but only one. I can't think of any movie from Tarantino's past that only had one gratifying scene that you're totally invested in and/or have some satisfaction or enjoyment after it's done....until now.

My answer would be \"Oh yeah!\"", "You need to know what happened on that day": "In my opinion, to understand what this movie tries to achieve you need to know what happened on the 9th of August in 1969 and you have to have prior knowledge in details on the occurred events. I did not know and got really bored after 40 minutes. I thought that this is going nowhere and not really a Tarantino kind of movie. But because a friend of mine advised to see this, I searched for some background info. I updated my knowledge on what happened and after that I understood the small details and really enjoyed it throughout. Maybe one of Tarantino's best!", "Just because its tarrantino doesnt automatically make it good": "A bit underwhelming to say the least. Felt like walking out of the cinema at times was that bored. Nothing really happened until the last 20 mins of the movie, story felt aimless, lacking and pointless. If you like character studies and endless dialogue SURE this might be the movie for you. But i was honestly just super restless throughout. The only redeeming factor of the movie was the last scene. So unless you want to sit through an hour of mindless drab just to get to that then go for it.This just goes to show superb acting and talent sometimes CANT make up for a lack of story.", "This is Art": "Although some moments in the film I think they didn't have to be as long as the recordings of Rick's movie, it's all very well done, directed, acted and assembled. The end is to fill the heart with a hope that cannot exist, since in real life, unfortunately, that's not what happened. Tarantino's parallel universe is always more satisfying. If he were the creator of the world, I think it would be more fun and maybe fair...", "A true tarentino film": "The well made film with a touch of comedy which can turn brutal in a second, another tarentino masterpiece.", "Really boring, did not meet expectations": "Expected to be blown away by the reviews and actors involved.

A new QT film with great stars, (Leonardo DiCaprio is an all time favourite), makes this a must see.That's all folks! Script not worth my time, the action or storyline has no pace. The best I can say is some of the scenes recreating old movie classics were clever.I left the film at the point where Sharon asks for, and gets a freebie ticket. Why can't she pay 75c? Grrrr.I have heard that if you can wait 3 hours, you'll get a bit of action right at the end.", "Stupid \"remake\" of the awful crime ...": "... and victims neighbours are still with us :-( If Tarantino wanted some horryfying crime story, he was free to write his own scenario.

It was glorious seeing Cliff beat the out of Clem and put those deranged scumbags in their place. The fantasy gore-fest on the family at the end was precious. If the credits had been followed by a CGI'ed trailer of Rick Dalton starring in Chinatown I would have given this film 9 stars. I've find it nearly impossible to sit through most of Tarantino's childish cartoon garbage designed for ignorant ADD half-wits, which is how I characterize most of his work after the masterpiece PF, but this film shows he is truly capable of streaks of comedic brilliance worthy of an intelligent audience. Dicaprio is guaranteed the best actor Oscar for his tortured acting scenes within the film. Pitt is a bit of a lightweight as usual, but he fit his role perfectly and might win best supporting actor on likability and comedic timing alone.", "Slow scene after yet another slow scene!": "Great acting but over all a disappointment. I love Quentin Tarantino's slow moving scenes that build up to something great. This movie\nJust had one slow scene after another slow scene with nothing great.

How very un-PC it all was. Hey youngsters, it was really like this. Everyone smoked cigs! I watched at home in Blu-ray version and was couch-locked for the film's entirety.

Loved it!", "Confusing- Hot Mess": "Totally disjointed story of a has been tv-actor and his stunt double. The non-stop replaying of 60's commercials & tv-shows is interesting- but there is no plot. If I had actually paid money to see this convoluted tragedy, I would have walked out after 30-minutes. Somehow the Manson family & Sharon Tate are brought into this movie. This story makes no sense . The re-creation of 60's Los Angeles is neat - Quarantino should have just made a travelogue.

But at the end cliff action seen and brandy loyalty make my heart happy just unexpected .", "I've never disliked a Leo DiCaprio movie.....Until now.": "I had no idea what this movie was about other than the relationship between the main character and his stunt double and that is saying something.Brad and Leo are great individually in terms of acting but their characters aren't developed enough to inform the viewer of why they are where they are etc and they are not seen enough together to appreciate any chemistry between the two and so I was left feeling very underwhelmed with the idea of their friendship as it just wasn't explained well. The leading actress has virtually no appearances in this other than once where she watches her own movie and another picking up a hitchhiker (snooze alert) won't spoil the ending. What was the point of her character? If anyone knows please do tell. Considering her face is on the front cover she was more like an extra than a lead.Back to the plot of which there is none, this film left me incredibly bored. I loved pulp fiction, despite not being a fan of action films but I had to force myself to watch this. I didn't get reference to the Manson family which is probably in part due to my age, though I feel I still could have appreciated this film had it had a plot. It didn't. I loved the scenery and found that very clever how it was done. Unfortunately that's the only thing I can give this stars for. I'm 29 and my other half is 47 so we balance each other out from a bias point of view. We watched this movie together and both came away from it feeling very confused and disappointed.This is the kind of movie you could have in the background when washing up or something. If you're intending on having a proper movie night pick something else or risk 3 hours of boredom at your own peril. It's packed with unnecessary scenes and clips of of old movies that you're not going to appreciate if you haven't seen any of them. Couldn't wait for it to end.", "What rubbish": "I think Tarantino is laughing all the way to the bank!! 2 hours of my time wasted. So disappointed!!!", "Surprisingly satisfying": "Surprisingly satisfying and riveting....reality suspension engage. Pitt and DeCaprio work hard to be as real and believable as possible, and it works. Nice easter eggs abound, but main storyline as it unfolds is cathartic.", "AMAZING": "I don't understand how people can hate this. Just amazing as all of Tarantinos other movies. The music, lighting and costume design were all brilliant and sparked the 60s effect.", "Great-Ish": "Being someone who has never seen any other Tarantino film, I watched this film without any knowledge of his usual style. The films strongest aspects are the acting, the dialogue, the 60s style, and the ending. While the film's weak points include it's writing, pacing, and tone. Meanwhile, the directing can be good for some scenes while others; not so much. Leonardo DiCaprio is the film's big highlight; he brings so much emotion and charm to the film and despite his sometime failed methods to make me believe he's not just playing a role in other films; here he immersed himself in this role. Brad Pitt is charming and enjoyable; Margot Robbie, while not having many lines, still brings home some fun interactions throughout the film. The different conversations occurring between the actors is believable and astonishing. The 60s style takes you back in time. Finally, the ending is effing awesome. Despite these strong points; the film lacks a plot or at the very least a plot that's plausible. And most of the scenes in this film drag out for ages; however that may have been the intention and the problem isn't evident with the acting and dialogue saving each scene. The directing can feels nonexistent for most of the film; sometimes it works in the film's favor by allowing you to indulge in the film and other times scenes that severely need direction have none. Also, the tone of the film often switches from lightheartedness to darker scenes. Although most films use a switch in tone, this one is blatantly obvious. If a Tarantino film is like this one than perhaps I should watch more of them. The film's weak and strong points are able to balance out each other to where the film is objectively great from a filmmaking perspective but not great subjectively if your looking for a comedy, blockbuster.", "WARNING- metaphorical joke ahead": "It's not true what they say about oysters being an aphrodisiac; I had 10 last night and 4 of them didn't work.", "Need to watch more Tarantino films to fully understand the film": "I thought that this movie was pretty good. I haven't seen very many Quentin Tarantino films, however I've heard many good things about them, mostly regarding the cinematography and references to pop culture among other things. However, I very much enjoyed the film. The movie takes place in the 1960's in Los Angeles, where an actor and his stunt double try to recapture fame and success. The film also touches on aspects of Charles Manson, the American cult leader in the 60's and the impact of his cult, depicting the young followers, primarily women, in Los Angeles. I thought that this movie depicts the acting skills of Leonardo Dicaprio and Brad Pitt in a very good way. However, I thought that Dicaprio's performance in The Wolf of Wallstreet was more impressive, not to say that this was not impressive. Margot Robbie, who played Sharon Tate in the film is also one of my favourite actresses, and I love following her works. I would give this movie a 7/10, mostly because Tarantino films are still so new to me and I need more time to really get into the movies.", "A Quentin Tarantino Masterpiece": "I don't think I've ever seen such a hilarious and brilliant joke told in film that manages to both break and not break the, \"4th wall,\" as if combining filmmaking and quantum physics. I laughed out loud for a long time.I'm so glad, considering the dark subject matter of a lot of Tarantino's other films, for the way he approached making this film.This is the fairy tale we probably all wish had been reality. The edge of honesty he used to portray all of the characters was in perfect balance, and despite clear elements of what you might dub his unique kitsch, exquisitely captured humanity. An ethereal message was told through story without a hint of preaching.This is a true Masterpiece, imo.", "Still 10": "Not Tarantinos best work imo but still amazing compared to mainstream.", "I left feeling a bit dissapointed": "Having said that it had its moments (last 20 min). Everything before that could have been 1 hour instead of 2,5 h. I just waited for the story to start, and it kind of never did.

We already know everything that is shown inbetween lets say minute 30 to 100 of the film.I like LD and BP as characters and they are well played, but cut this movie... just get rid of 1h inbetween and it is a good movie. But randomly introducing characters which are not at all telling you anything useful?You really need to like the 60-70 to like this movie. Otherwise it is just not worth watching. And sorry, a 10/10 for this movie is just plain wrong. Even if you like the lifestyle and stuff like this, this movie is never ever a 10/10.For me this is a mix of three things:\nWe try to attract people who like the 60-70th and want to go back because they feel old today.TQ is a great director, this one needs to be good too.We want to heal the founds the Manson family has caused for the sould of the Hollywood lifestyle.It is not the movie itself why people watch it. Just because the movie itself is not worth the time to watch it.", "Waste of talent": "Its a pity that so many great actors were used for this average, overextended and pointless movie.", "Way overrated!": "Some characters are not even necessary or I'm not sure where they fit to the story, yet too much boring time spent on them.

The black cloud that has hung over the heads of many people that were effected (directly/indirectly) by the Mansion Murders now can look up and see a silver lining.

Then the last 20 minutes is when the film actually starts. I loved the end the fact that the mansion family were killed instead of Sharon tate an Co. but it felt like that was the only reason Tarantino made this film, he just wanted to see them die at the end and the rest of the film was there as a filler. I honestly think it would have been better a short 40 minute film they could have packed the first 2 and a half hours into 20 minutes the the big finally", "Not the Tarantino we wanted, but the Tarantino we needed": "I must confess I set high expectations before watching this movie, even though the premise seemed neither atractive, nor Tarantino-like to me.I especially loved all the details we have been granted regarding the characters whose past was anyway extremely vague and blurry. We get plenty of time to observe, analize their habits, their way of life through this journey filled with eye-candy scenes and cinematic history. Still, I expected more action, being given this entire build-up. The moment all paths merged was indeed unique and I enjoyed it despite its apparently ridiculous pretext. However, this movie was meant to be mostly a comedy so I took it with a pinch of salt.Comparing this movie with Pulp Fiction would be pointless, especially since Tarantino's style has been adapted to our era. Watching 'Once upon a time... ' has been enjoyable but I don't feel like I could repeat this experience anytime soon since it didn't leave me doubting anything at all.", "Acting of the highest level, storyline is okay": "Brad Pitt is why you have to watch this, he shows on so many occasions why he is a great actor and fully deserved of his Oscar. Di Caprio was fine, not his best performance but acceptable. Other than that it's was just okay. Confusing storyline that kept taking different turns, Margot Robbie doesn't need to be in the film as her part is very to put it lightly, boring. But the last 15 minutes really saved this movie. And Pitt was superb!", "Tarantino's love letter to cinema": "Much like Inglorious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino crafts an alternative take on history; but this time, a period so personal to him.What you're going to get is perhaps his most laid-back film to date, and that's kind of a fantastic thing about this one.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is part slice-of-life and part buddy flick taking a trip down memory lane with vintage Hollywood as a backdrop.With a certain evil lurking in the background, Hollywood is a portrait of an era that's about to die and transition into the modern. Leonardo's character is an actor of old struggling to find that transition and his best pal is out doing deeds and rubs elbows with the Manson Family. Margot's character is a young actress romanticizing her bright future in this bright town.It all comes full swing in classic Tarantino fashion with an explosive finale.Not everyone is going to sit through this film understanding its purpose; but to those cinephiles among us, romanticizing once upon a time is pure bliss.", "It's just not good": "Surprisingly bad and underwhelming. Not actually a 1-star, but I've put it in order to balance some 10-star overhyped reviews. Full of cheap references to an otherwise cool era, and it's plainly not that good. The film just shows that whatever Tarantino does, that it will be considered a hit. Do not watch it, or, if you want to see it, feel free to walk out when you get bored, it's not worth it for some cheap Tarantino-violence at the end.", "I lost 2 hours of sleep \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00b4... not 3!": "My TV is better closed than playing this rubbish! I should have closed it from the first 30 minutes. Who gave such high rates, Jesus!!!", "Inherent Vice meets La La Land": "What's up with everyone making movies or series with nostalgia and zero plot? First Stranger Things 3 and now this.This movie was almost as boring as \"Inherent Vice\" but I give it +0.5 points because I didn't fall totally asleep besides the very lengthy runtime. Atmosphere and cinematography are amazing but the most important ingredient is missing; plot.It feels like they shot every mundane thing like going to a restaurant, feeding your dog, watching television, driving around, that adds nothing. Margot's role was totally out of place as well and the movie could hold itself without her and save 1 hour of random shots of her legs and her giggling in a cinema and some random dancing in every scene.There are just too many cringy and annoying parts in this movie. Even Bruce Lee makes an appearance as a caricature.I'm happy I didn't have to pay to watch this. If I had paid I would feel cheated.", "Overated, as usual.": "Even if you know is just a movie, not a documental, the plot fades at the end. I do like the work of Di Caprio and Pit, but Sharon Tate's character is lame, does not give justice to her story, you truly expect more, and she is just a dol face. I'm disappointed.", "Dicaprio does it again - no spoilers": "Whenever Dicaprio acts in a movie Hollywood should not even bother with Oscar nominations for best actor; just deliver it to Dicaprio.

I'm a huge fan of QT and had high expectations from this film only to be let down. 2 stars for set, wardrobe and acting, the scenes just carried on for ever just when I thought the scene was going to go somewhere it was over. I truly dont understand how there is so many 9 and 10 star reviews, complete failure in my book. Maybe this QT film just went over my head.", "Another Tarantino foray into alternate reality": "Like 'Django Unchained' and 'Inglorious Basterds', 'Once upon a time in Hollywood' presents an alternate reality in an attempt to rectify the unrectifiable: the hideous, senseless murder of Sharon Tate, her unborn son, and her friends at the hands of Manson family in 1969.\nThe movie is hailed as a love letter to the last days of the Golden Age of Hollywood and a faithful vivid portrayal of the late 60's America, yet even that portrait is partially flawed. Fifty years on, America is still (apparently) struggling with its counterculture legacy, either vilifying or ridiculing it. Tarantino does both, equating more or less hippies with followers of Charles Manson while ignoring the fact that the Tate-Polanski couple were as much hippie as they were jet set, being later referred to as 'the anti-establishment establishment'.\nYou'll encounter familiar characters, situation and places, but unfortunately they are caricatures (sometimes grotesque) of the people who they claim to portray, be it Bruce Lee or Steve McQueen.\nSharon Tate is no exception, and one wishes the time allotted to her character were better utilized, instead of creating such a hollow, one dimensional persona that doesn't serve any narrative purpose. For whatever's worth, we get to see the real Sharon in film footage, instead of Margot's superimposed image.\nDon't let anyone fool you into thinking that this movie is not about Sharon Tate's murder. In the end, the 2 main characters seem to merely serve as a plot device: they fulfill a role Sharon's neighbors and friends couldn't... be in the right place at the right time.\nIn that regard, the movie is very effective. As I was watching the last scenes I couldn't help wondering: where were the real Sharon Tate's neighbors that fateful summer night 50 years ago?", "A Huge Letdown": "I was so excited for the last summer of the decade to arrive because I knew that my favorite director was going to be releasing his penultimate 9th film before he quits (so he says).I per-ordered my tickets and was so excited that he decided to use the Manson murders as a basis for his new movie. I thought that this movie was going to explore these murders more and that a lot of action would be involved.I couldn't have been more wrong. It was pretty much a snooze fest even thought they had some of the best actors that contemporary Hollywood has to offer. There's no real \"action\" until the last 30 minutes of the movie when DiCaprio comes out wielding a flamethrower to roast some poor SOB in the Mansion pool.His signature profanity and foot fetish is in this movie but all this movie really is, is a \"chill out\" movie about friends in 60's Hollywood hanging out together. The mood rarely turned dark and you were pretty much laughing throughout the whole thing. It was like a the Res Dogs \"Tip\" Scene going on for almost 2 hours but with none of the action that Res Dogs had.This movie has probably divided die-hard QT fans. Some will like it, others will hate it. I'm the latter.Let's hope he goes out with a bang for his final 10th film in the next decade and really gives it his all before he puts down the camera for good.", "Tarantino's cinephilia at its top": "Tarantino tells the cinema through the cinema. The movie is a perfect portrait of the 1969's Los Angeles during \"The Golden Age\" of Hollywood and the widespread of Hippies movement. Violence is not at the base of the movie (as we would expect). We can say that it is the love letter of this extraordinary director to the seventh art which he is real passionate about. The movie is linear, fluent, sometimes funny until the Manson Family is ready to get into action and commit what we know as \"the Cielo Drive Massacre\". Here Tarantino gives us an incredible plot twist and change history (as he did in \"Inglorious Basterds\"). It is at the end of the film that Tarantino's genius real comes out.", "Charming": "What makes this movie special is all the love and care that was put into it, especially at this caliber where Hollywood is literally transformed to its \"Golden Age\". Every reference to the past is glossed over by the next, until they appear so rapidly that they can be easily missed. The characters seem as if they're plucked right out of the 60's, and in some cases they are. Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton felt like a real actor struggling to make an impression during this time in his career, especially after leaving his television stardom. His face always shows him being concerned about his future when it's not being filled with booze instead. I thought he would be a real mad in the film, but instead I sympathized with the character and felt relived near the end of his arc. The real shine belongs to Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth, who feels as if he's another persona of Pitt alongside Tyler Durden or Floyd from True Romance. He's pretty much cool personified for lack of a better term. Quentin Tarantino created two lovable characters and gave them a bromance that'll surely be remembered in pop culture history. Alongside the two are real life Hollywood figures who share the same amount of talent as the 2 leads. Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate is nothing more than respectable but still charming. She wasn't trying to make the character complex but instead opts to be more grounded in reality. The overall plot, however, is different because there isn't one. Really...there isn't a plot to the movies. It's just characters going through the trials of 60's Hollywood all set in relations with the murder of Sharon Tate. This, in my opinion, is both a flaw and a compliment. It can be easily viewed as boring, even I thought that at first, especially with a run time of almost three hours. But when the movie is viewed for a second or even third time, it shows its true form and stays thoroughly entertaining until the epic conclusion. Personally, I feel as if Tarantino released this movie near the end of the decade similar to it being set near the end of its decade. While being a moderate success, it looks like peanuts compared to The Lion King's 1-billion-dollar box office income due to it opening on the same weekend. It made me reflect on how movies themselves have changed during the years and what new ideas can either make or break. A movie like this will always have a special place in my heart, not only for its love on cinema but for it charm.", "Self indulgent and boring": "The cinematography is good, and the 60's vibe is done well, but I just didn't care about the characters or the story.

Tarantino's skill as a director is irrefutable, but even the greatest scene composition and cinematography cannot entertain you for 160 minutes without anything even vaguely resembling a plot.

Because if I have to sit through two and a half hours of pointless build up for fifteen minutes of excitement then I'd rather watch paint dry!!. As a lover of Quentin I have seen all his films and enjoyed every single one of them so it pains me to have to write a review like this. The actors were fantastic and that's the reason for the stars. But I seriously think that all the backstory had no relevance to the final scene, other than a couple of scenes that are funny and show where the characters come from. But it leads to a finale of something that hardly has any relevance to any of the other pointless rubbish we'd watched before. Not a typical Quentin film, I think it's time to give up and p.s I'd like a refund please", "A good attempt at making a very Tarantino-esque take on the real life incident, But that's all it is": "Not one of the best movies of Tarantino, It's good tho", "161 minutes": "Of overdone cliche regarding the era ending in more cliche drudgery. This movie will sell because it advertises the Manson Murders and Sharon Tate. Loosely, weakly, it attempts to use the murders as a timeline, but falls horribly short.

Save your money.", "Not his best": "But still what an amazing director, amazing in everything he creates, we will miss him.

I tried with Django, then tried again with The Hateful Eight and tonight I was excited to see Once Upon... Why? Because it got great reviews and many raved how this was his best work so far... Well did I walk out of the theater disappointed and grossing in wtf's.The best thing to me is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as he is pretty darn good and yes Brad Pitt is kinda cool and funny, but he's far from memorable. And why did Margot Robbie agree to do this movie? She is mainly hired for her gorgeous looks, but in the movie itself there's nothing to gain for her and her screen time is very limited.And then my main annoyance... This movie is incredibly boring. It's slow paced, it's hardly funny and the few funny moments are fairly predictable. And there is no character development or storyline whatsoever. You don't feel for any of the characters and it lacks the type of dialogues that QT is famous for. Looking at my watch hardly an hour into to the movie is not a good sign.I don't know, maybe I have gotten older and this simply isn't for me anymore, but I beg to differ. During the previews they showed the trailer for Joker and that got me more excited then 2 1/2 hours of Once Upon... I'll skip QT10.", "Insult to Storytelling": "As with Hitchcock in the 1970s, Tarantino now has reached a point in his career where he can put out anything and it will get critical praise. As a newly published author myselfd who had to deal with hundreds of rejections beforehand, I see this as a disgrace to writing--no even remote hint of a plot structure or any kind of story development is present. It just sputters from one scene to the next. DiCaprio is the only one who gives any kind of performance in the long drawn-out affair, and only about the last ten minutes are somewhat entertaining.By the way, I like Kurt Russell, but he has NO BUSINESS narrating anything with his vocal delivery.", "161 minutes of \"no\"": "I have fallen for the \"written and directed by Quentin Tarantino\" badge one too many times. I don't know if this counts as a spoiler but this movie has NO plot, NO story. I'll admit, it has acting but first, that's not Tarantino's doing and second, that's just not enough for a movie, any movie, to be enjoyable.\nI'll also admit his movies are not for everyone but I still don't get why people give him so much credit, when there are far more talented directors/writers in the business.\nIt's more entertaining to watch your bathwater drain than this movie.", "I can see the idea , but the most boring movie ever.": "Over 2 hours only with talk . The most boring movie ever made in the history.Wait wait wait. Talk talk talk . More talk talk talk .So boring .", "Pretentious rubbish.": "Quentin, I'm going to find you and drown you in engine oil for this waste of my time.", "Disapointing and long": "There is no real plot to this movie. It's just scenes kind of happening. That is not a problem by it self. But the fact that the dialog is not that great and the movie is 2h41 makes it a problem. The acting is amazing but the characters are not at the same level. I like Brad's character and the main hippie girl. But the other where underwhelming. There is only 2 good scenes in this movie, the rest for me was disappointing and boring. Maybe if you have nostalgia for Hollywood in the 60s you will enjoy it a little more than me.", "Really??": "Disgracing Bruce Lee??? That was not cool Quentin!! Like that would ever have happened EVER!", "A fun movie and a nice, nostalgic production with a nod to a significant time for general culture": "DiCaprio e Pitty once again they show that they are real actors.\nBut the \"Tarantino film\" only begins at the end of the second hour. The final 30 minutes are Tarantino classic, including changing the reality of what actually happened to Sharon Tate, murdered by those freaks of the \"Manson family\". A fairy tale that is easy to see and enjoy.", "It is by definition a self-indulgence movie": "What is a self-indulgence movie?\nIf you have foot fetish, you have so many bare feet scenes, that's self indulgence.\nIf you like to objectify women, you have every scene with women in it be either taking from 'elevator view' or 'rear view', that's self indulgence.\nIf you like violence, you have to 'squeeze in' the unnecessarily violent faux climax, that's self indulgence.\nIf you don't like Bruce Lee, you have him literally look like a clown, while the real Bruce Lee is nothing like that (just watch a documentary or movie to see for yourself), that's self-indulgence.\nThis movie does have its merits. I actually like the slow boiling pace for the most part, although the overuse of still-move-still-move to make a false sense of tempo is pretentious (and yes, self indulgence). However, any new wave movie would satisfy my taste in slow pace/nonethingness, and most of them are actually better at achieving this.It's not bad. It's just self-indulgent at its most.", "Absolutely Amazing!": "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is absolutely superb. All of the actors here are on their A game as they give us great memorable performances. DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie Include a lot of depth to their characters and are amazing along with the rest of the cast.The direction, cinematography and music choice is also done to perfection. Quentin Tarantino definitely knows how to make a great film.I have just watched this film for the 4th time, and it keeps pulling me back for another viewing. That's got to be a sign of a great film.Overall I recommend this film highly, but if you don't know much or anything about the Manson murders I encourage a bit of research. Otherwise you may be a little confused and won't know where the story is heading.", "Was hoping for much better": "Been looking forward to this film for a year. Acting was great. Everything else bad.", "A classic good ol' 10........": "What a classic storytelling, direction, screenplay, just awesome seeing Brad and Leo on screen , is something just Rare, with a all the mix from Tarentino . Just too good.", "Tarantino must have left it to someone else": "I doubt that Tarantino had much to do with this film at all, it just doesn't have the key elements that he brings to a film.Pitt makes a good effort as does DiCaprio but apart from a fleeting five minutes towards the end, this just doesn't come across as a Tarantino movie. Very disappointing.", "The more I watch this movie the more I appreciate it.": "Firstly I've been a huge QT all my life. I'll never forget watching Reservoir Dogs, and I was immediately hooked, and drawn to his movies. Pulp Fiction is my favorite, and RD is a close second. I digress, this movie is a straight love letter to Hollywood during the time when movies were all the rage, and being a hippie was natural. I also love the comradery between Pitt, and Leo it's so good, and Pitt is so loyal, and definitely deserved that Oscar for best supporting. I also love how he puts his owe twist on how the Manson murders happen, bc it's his universe, and he can do what he wants with it as he pleases. He did the same thing with Adolf Hitler in \"Inglorious Basterds\". This movie is hilarious, but it does lack violence department until the end scene, which he is know for, but it just proves just like \"Jackie Brown\" he doesn't need violence to make a movie special. There is no director like him, and they probably never will be. I personally can't wait for his 10 and final movie. I also hope this \"Bounty Law\" show comes out soon!", "A joke": "The whole movie felt like a hollywood inside joke and Im sitting there getting pranked. The last 30 min were actually good and we enjoyed them very much. Some scenes were sloppy and felt irrelevant.", "Better, Mr. Tarantino, much better!": "The last Tarantino movie I went to see was \"Inglorious Basterds\". The previews made it look like a comedy of sorts so I, my wife and her friend went to see it. I had to apologize profusely as we walked back to the car after watching all the self-aggrandizing, gratuitous blood and guts, let alone the revisionist history that it portrayed - not that anyone wouldn't have wanted it to happen that way. I swore I'd never see another one of his movies. I'm glad I broke that oath.Well, Mr. Tarantino did it again in this movie with its climax, hilariously so, but it was a much more pleasant departure from the actual facts. The one scene that absolutely blew me away was Damian Lewis' portrayal of Steve McQueen. The voice wasn't quite what I'd expected but his mannerisms and face were unexpectedly enjoyable. The entire movie had me wishing, as I often do, that Old Hollywood could jump out of that 2D screen and live with us again - warts and all. It was an incredible time that will never be again.Watching DiCaprio going from \"bad acting\" to \"good acting\" in his character's travails was educational as well as entertaining. I've always enjoyed any behind the scenes \"extras\" on my DVDs. Both he and Mr. Pitt are a couple of the best actors on screen today. Can't say enough about both of them.Thanks Mr. Tarantino and also thanks to the whole cast that made this movie so enjoyable. I will be getting the DVD to play again and again.", "Disappointment..!!": "Awesome cinematography, super acting and dialogues, attention to detail.. all these but the main drawback was a bull sh** plot. Throughout the movie I kept wondering if there is a point in completing or should I just walk out. Super performance by folks but totally disappointing overall.", "I was very excited to watch this movie": "There is nothing like the stories that took place in the 70s. I was a part of that generation, and grew up liking the whole genre, from the music to the cloths and to the attitudes at that time. Boogie Nights, Son of Sam and many other films captured the feeling well of that time. This film lacked a story! I never felt interested at any moment to continue watching. What was the message? The story? There was none. It was all about Tarantino as usual trying to shock us, snd surprise us with an empty plot,....again. !", "Surprusing Ending": "I won't spoil it here but I turned it off 30 minutes before the ending because I thought what's all going to happen. But I forgot this was Tarantino movie. I watched the remaining 30 mins next day ... and man, was it ever good !", "You need to be patient": "This movie is so slow, that you can sense how you are getting old. An hour and a half before something happens. The dialogs are so simple, that maybe an 11 year old could do a better job", "Good cinematography, disappointing screenplay": "This movie was a visiul blast. It was a good experience of seeing the 60's Hollywood. And acting performances were good as expected.\nBUT i still don't understand how the screenplay of this movie was liked this much.\nIt feels like you wait for movie to start until last 30 minutes of the movie and the story was so superficial. So it was a disappointment.", "WTF.......": "The tarantin's decay !!! movie without content, who wrote this ??? Someone wrote that this movie, was a bit of each of Tarantino's other movies, don't insult the other Movies!\nCarlos Xavier", "A movie for the late 60's retro": "The first part of the movie are well introduced with much focus on the 60's retro. Not much happening, but I still got the feeling of the movie being good. The last 50 minutes things where about to happen with more action and fun combat fighting!", "Charles Manson Murder Twist": "This movie is absolutely phenomenal. No spoilers, the two lead actors are stunning. Great to see them take on new roles still. If you're a fan of Tarantino's movies you'll love this. And if you're a fan of Charles Manson, you'll like it even more. Great film, worth the buy/watch.", "Easily Tarantino's best work": "The cinematography, the acting, the story, everything in this movie is perfect and fits together so well. I would even go as far to say its his best film yet.", "Amazing movie!": "I loved this movie. Maybe it was because I was a teenager during the time. It took place oh, but they did such a great job of recreating it. DiCaprio and Brad Pitt's performances were incredible. They really showed their acting chops. The other actors were great too.", "2.41 hs, could do it on 2 or less.": "The movie is full of unnecesary following scenes on cars, \"videoclip\" style.\nSo much \"information\" that isn't relevant to the story.No action. But the dialog isn't there either. Just a simple, VERY SIMPLE, story stretchet to 3 times the duration it's need to be.Worst Tarantino movie. Dull, long, boring, no substance whatsoever.He needed to listen to himself and make the hateful eight his last movie.", "Masterpiece? Really?": "Before seeing this movie I was looking at all these reviews here, and couldn't help but notice all these 10/10 \"best Tarentino movie yet\" , and after viewing i'm wondering if we saw the same movie.\nThe main problem I have with this film is it is very bland especially for a Quinten Tarentino film. With the 2hr 41min run time there are no intriguing events that occur, which is a shame because there could be so many.\nAnother problem I have is that the events that do happen build up some type of tension just to be a big let down, like nothing happens and you never see those characters again.\nAnd on a side note I do understand that he was trying to build a 1970s atmosphere but it does not have to be in a useless shots are Margot Robbie just walking around watching herself at a movie theater.\nNeedless to say kinda sucks. I hate to say this because l love Quinten and his work, but this is just a big let down. The saving grace of this movie is the final minutes but is it really worth the 2hr 30ish minute build up? No, no it's not.", "Well made, good acting, but didn't capture me": "Everything is well made, the acting is good, I enjoyed the dialogues. But somehow the movie couldn't keep my interest. Didn't stay for the end...", "Smug film with plenty of clever references, but overall not enjoyable": "Quentin Tarantino's style is almost overcrowding this film, which is not an easy task at 2h40m. You have your nod at the kong-fu film industry, Nazi and other post-WW2 film references, and of course plenty of Westerns from the period. There is sex, violence, a bit of comedy, and combinations of all 3.Overall, however, the movie seems like a string of unrelated events, clips and clever nods, without ever summing up to anything meaningful. The two main characters hang out, get drunk, get into a bit of trouble, but that's pretty much it. Maybe this is intentional, because that's how pop films were typically structured in the era? I'm not an expert on trashy 60s films, so I wouldn't know. Me and my friends were bored, and left the movie feeling like we wasted our time watching an episode of 'The way we were' about Hollywood's glorious 60s.If you're a big fan of the period, you might find all the allusions and nods fun to watch. For the average, non-neckbearded viewer, I don't think watching this would be much more than a weird experiment in recreating a dead genre, but with Brad Pitt and Leonardo DeCaprio (along with many other famous actors). Sorry, it's just not that great.", "A very unique film.": "I'm one that believes film review should be short. Tarantino's film is definitely unlike anything I've ever seen with various details and storylines that are confusing at first but eventually intertwine to be an interesting and terrific series of events featuring some of the best actors of all time.", "Better and better with every watch": "Saw it in theaters and liked it, as I'm a huge fan of Tarantino, but I found myself being underwhelmed. This might've been due to the fact I\n1. Am only 21 so had very little insight on Sharon Tate and what actually happened in real life.\n2. Was expecting another huge, wildly enthralling movie such as Django.\nDon't go in with expectations and just enjoy. I've seen it 3 times now and absolutely love it.", "Shockingly bad": "No plot. No story. Pointless film. Oh and way too long. And a bit disrespectful considering Sharon Tate and friends were the ones murdered .", "Very nice": "I am not a Tarantino enthusiast, but this movie catch your attention and transport you to that era.\nIt's a simple plot, reminded of \" Seinfeld \" style, but it keeps drawing you till the end, with some Tarantino violence for the finale.\nThe actors are strong and \"born\" to do their roles, excellent casting.\nSide note: I always was a fan of Bruce Lee since I was a kid, but I wasn't bothered at all that he was portrayed as an arrogant phony.", "Excellently Crafted, Poorly Designed": "Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting, endearing soundtrack, and wonderful \"feel\".But the plot is nonexistent for the first hour of the film, and progresses at only 2 points:When it is introduced (in the middle of the film), and when it ends (at the end). The plot goes from A, disappears, and then goes straight to Z.This movie is a collection of many great scenes that are connected mostly just by the characters within them. It is a character study for sure, but even the worst character studies have a strong central plot. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood does not.With a more prevalent plot, this film is an absolute ten. As is, anything more than a seven is hard to justify.", "Enjoyable albeit long": "I enjoyed the acting, the story, and chronology, with a satisfying twist.", "Not as expected": "I wanted to love this movie since Tarantino is one of my most favorite directors. Cast was great, acting good, and he captured the late 70s Hollywood feel spot on. But where was the classic Tarantino dialogue? That dialogue was what made me fall in love with his movies over and over. This movie lacked that and when it was over I felt pretty let down.\nIt's was ok to watch, but won't be rushing to watch it again anytime soon.", "Truly Disgusting": "Why dos the actress demean herself and flaunt her body, legs and feet? Why does the teen do the same?It is so natural. Body parts are natural and therefore should be banned. Stat. I am reporting this to IMDB.Western taliban FTW!PS: I have already moderated the keywords.", "Genuine 9/10! sometimes the pace dropped but always engaging": "Great shots throughout, will be shown in film studies classes across the globe as an example on how to make a film, how to use camera positions, lighting, directing, acting etc.As well as being entirely mesmerised throughout, I was entertained, made to laugh, and horrified.\nMainly though I found myself longing to see more of Brad Pitt, his performance alone is worth seeing this film,\nThere are occasions where the film pace can feel a little slow, but at those points I found myself being able to take a little more appreciation of the set, lighting, camera work, and general feel of the scene, another masterclass by QT, it'll definitely be a film you'll want to watch more than once.Spoiler (ish)I will say that if you have a basic understanding of the history linking Roman Polanski, and Charles Manson it will enhance your viewing and help you imagine how thing could've been", "Great Movie but Different than QT's Others": "If you're expecting over the top violence, this does not deliver on that until the last ten minutes. The first two hours expect an amazingly shot film capturing the nostalgia of the 60s Hollywood.", "Yes, a great loveletter to Hollywood, but slowwwwww": "Slower than than the Hateful Eight in fact. There was tons to love about this flick, but even 45 mins in you realize that it lacks an actual moving plot, and dare i say a focus.", "Solid QT": "Another solid QT movie, can't be anything but good.. takes some time to get the grip of the story though", "One of Quentin's best": "Quentin's movies are different and that's why they stand out. No generic crap. Surprising at times. Great watch.", "Rotten eggs !": "I attended the movie with 4 of my friends all of us were frustrated by 3 hours of the sluggish sequalae of the film....longier scenes...no drama structure & slow stupid repetitive scenes...", "Haydn Engel Reviews": "Real rating: 77.5/100\nCritics love Tarantino because he loves cinema and they can associate with that, and they get all of his references, which can be lost on your average viewer. It is the same reason movies set in LA often get a few noms or wins during Oscar season that many would call questionable. This is not to detract from Tarantino's talent. The man is a great writer, though as of late he has become a blowhard. Scripts are long and drawn out, and then they all crash into an ending that seems tacked on rather than built to which begs the question does he even know where he is going with his films anymore. It is not visionary, it is repetitive and showing very little sign of growth. He is a craftsman who carves an excellent movie each time, but they are more or less the same.DE: Tarantino runs a decent ship, and Hollywood is no different. Everything seems to be on point. Every department is hitting its marks, and we are building a tale in his distinct (if that is the right word) style. In terms of editing, the loss of Sally Menke can be felt in every one of his films since she passed. She somehow was able to contain him and give a better structure. Though from seeing her works outside of the Tarantino verse, you can see he had an equal part in elevating her. Together they were able to take his longwinded approach and make it come off with a steady pace and allow decent investment from the audience, but now however that is slipping away at a fast pace with each subsequent film.W: Tarantino is one of the great writers, he is not on Miyazaki's or Anderson's level, but he is undoubtedly on the same level as the Coen brothers or Bong Joon-ho. Which is not a level to sniff at, but the problem with Tarantino's writing is that he may have switched genres, but he has not adapted to it. More that he has made another Tarantino movie with a new shell on it. Which is great, but if I wanted to see the same thing as before I might as well watch the classics. It is sort of like a band doing a new tour 20 years later trying to flog the new stuff that sounds far too similar to the old stuff, and the fans would much rather prefer to hear the hits.C: Have you seen a Tarantino, Scorsese or Oliver Stone movie? Then guess what you have seen Robert Richardson's work and along with it some iconic shots that have littered avatars and uni students bedrooms for decades. His outing this time is impressive, though it might not match a level that he created. That said the lens seems to tell more of a story here than Tarantino's writing, which tells you everything you need to know.A: Acting is stereotypically cartoonish, but that has become a standard for Tarantino. Though Pitt's depiction of the more sane character throughout this 2D world of actors stands out. Sadly given the cast, we are working with, and the sheer level of talent coupled with the extent in which we examine these characters lives it feels underwhelming, and each one is more an allegory than a persona in their own right.S: As strange as it seems the sound department is usually one of the reasons I watch a Tarantino film. Since Inglourious Basterds someone in the sound department is getting an Oscar nom, whether it is music, mixing or editing. Without fail Hollywood continues this trend. Just excellent.S: As strange as it seems the sound department is usually one of the reasons I watch a Tarantino film.

Just excellent.PD: This film is not pretending to be the 1960s, it is the 1960s. I know you have seen many a period piece, and they all do a decent job, but it is the subtle nuances and the dirt that make the difference. This is not a glossy veneer trying to rewrite a section of history, this is just trying to capture an era for better or worse. This may be down to the fact that Tarantino is obsessed with the period and only a slight glance at his oeuvre would back this notion up.BA: The costume design, while simple is also great, it catches the style of the era without feeling like it is overexaggerating the form or the zeitgeist of the time. The visual effects in the latter portion of the film while jarring are quite well done and stand out.EVO: It is not one of Tarantino's \"funner\" films, which is odd given that it is a bright nostalgia backed film told from the perspective of mostly positive souls. If you are a Tarantino completest, you are going to want to see it, but for many, the question of why did I sit through that for 3 hours will ring true on the lips, and while the film is crafted brilliantly I cannot help but finding myself siding with them.", "If you're anticipating gore and violence this is not for you": "On the other hand, if you enjoy beautiful film making and are capable of detecting nyances in the atmosphere and in the facial expressions of the actors, even in silence, you will see some amazing acting and a truly captivating story. Somehow a lot of Tarantino fans seem to think the abundance of violence is the measure of a good film, those people should really consider rewatching all Tarantino-films and try to look at all but the gore.", "The value is somewhere else.": "Maybe its not a classic QT movie. Maybe the storyline is \"not there\". Maybe its dull or even pretentious. Maybe you won be at the edge of your seat till the last 20 minutes of the movie. Who cares.

It's a shame to make such a bad movie with a great cast.", "Tarantino is a \"has been\" now": "Literally one of the worst films I've seen in a while. I just could not sit through it. I love DiCaprio and Pitt but the script was too bad to save it. After seeing the last QT films, I now think, maybe this guy is overrated. His work in the 90's and early 00's were really good. But I guess his time is over and now he just tries too hard to be \"Tarantino\". Acting was actually good, again, this is why I gave 2 out of 10.

Guantanamo bay just got the new material to torture people with. If you filmed a hermit, living on a mountain, starring at his feet that would not be distinguished from a QT movie.

I hope he never makes another film.", "You either love it, or hate it.": "Despite Quintin Tarantino being my favorite director of modern cinema, i didn't enjoy this film as a whole. Tarantino is known for his witty dialogue and violence in his movies. You can almost instantly feel the vibe of a Tarantino movie by watching the first couple minutes. Although the film had the vibe of a Tarantino film, i felt as though i experienced a different story as i was used to. Most of his films start slow, building tension as the movie progresses, and ends with a bang. It hit all of the boxes, the tension didn't build up until about 20 minutes from the conclusion of the film despite its nearly 3 hour runtime. I felt as though the movie lacked purpose and without the action packed finale, i would not have enjoyed the film as a whole. Many people had fun with the movie but i did not experience the same.", "No reason to give this a 10/10 stars": "I am a QT fan, but this was the slowest and least interesting film QT has made. I did not identify with any of the characters. There were 5 scenes that made the movie\n1. Pitt and Bruce Lee\n2. Pitt and feeding his dog\n3. DiCaprio and the 8 year old girl\n4. Pitt against the Manson Family\n5. Pitt, the dog and DiCaprio nailed in the finale.\nAll these lasted about 55 minutes total.. few connecting scenes and 1.5 hour movie is all that was needed..\nOne last comment.. this is definitely a \"wishful thinking\" movie on what Hollywood wished would happened to Sharon Tate and her friends on that horrible night in 1969.", "Something I was expecting from Tarantino": "The film caught me by surprise, the highlight of movie is colorful space and the height of Hollywood movies.\nI really enjoyed.", "Nothing Happens": "Couldn't finish this movie because nothing happens.", "Tarantino Returns": "Good movie. Tarantino back where he should be. With a great ending which would rival any precious film from him.", "Better be prepared": "If you watch this film, you shouldn't expect to see tarantinos typical camera work or his unkonventional set design. For the most part of the film you propably won't even realize, that you are watching a tarantino made movie, if you don't already know it. But that does not bother at all. The problem with the Film in my opinion is, that it expects from the viewer to have 3 things: (1) You must have leisure, (2) you have to know the historical story of the Manson killings and (3) you still have to love tarantinos way to stretch sequences to a point were it gets ridiculous and his very own humor, that still shines through quite a lot of moments in this film. If these requirements are fulfilled, the effect at the finale will be so intelligent, that you will definitely not regret spending your last 3 hours with it. If this is not the case, you will propably just be confused and bored.", "Fave actors and director": "Turned out rubbish nearly walked out but didn't hoping for improvement, never materialised", "Tarantino Rises Again": "It's quite a long movie which didn't drag at all. There are legs still in Tarantino and it shows. Pitt is great as is Leo.

I haven't seen all his films, and I spent a lot of time covering my eyes for those I have watched. But I enjoyed every minute of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.I was a teenager in 1969 Los Angeles, living only a few miles from where the Tate murders occurred. Tarentino brilliantly recreated this moment - it is visually stunning and hugely evocative. The scenes at Spahn Ranch have the perfect touch of menace and fear, and the sense that something evil was about to poison the culture. The spaced out peace, love dreaminess of those days ended horrifically with Charles Manson.I had family and friends working in the entertainment industry: I knew many like DiCaprio and Pitt. The supposed plotless quality of the film mirrors the plotless quality of those lives. There wasn't much thought beyond the next gig. He also nailed the portentous and pretentious quality of B actors, and the desperate grasping to stay relevant. The constant self involved discussion. The continual ego building. Aimlessness was the whole point.Finally, I've bumped up against controversy around his depiction of women, in this film and in general. I can't comment, as I haven't seen all his movies. But for me , there was something intensely satisfying watching the murderer become the murdered. Tate and her baby were stabbed something like thirty times. I liked seeing this knife wielding fanatic go up in flames, even if it was only 'once upon a time.' If you lived those years, and the horror of her story and the La Biancas, you so want another ending. A different night, a different house, a different set of circumstances, and Tate's baby would be fifty years old. Oh, the terrible randomness of fate.", "Quite literally the worst movie of all time": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the worst movie ever madeIt is utter trash.There's absolutely no plot it's just a tipped hat to Hollywood and a bunch of old actors hanging out. A late night vh1 documentary beats this in every way.Watching Sharon Tate watch her self in a theater in this film is the most masturbatory thing I've ever witnessed. And undoubtedly that's exactly what all the actors in real life did when this movie came out. What a bunch of self absorbed losers.There's no action until the end, which completely comes out of left field. It's like Tarantino woke up from a fever dream and was like oh yeah we better put something bloody in here.2 hours in some narrator pipes in out of literally no where. In what universe is that okay??!! What a complete joke of a film.Seriously the worst film I've seen in my entire life. So incredibly boring it's unimaginable. I'd rather watch the grass grow than see this again.Pretty sad that Tarantino hires an all star cast and produces this utter rubbish out of it. It could have been an amazing movie. Instead we get a 3 hour circle jerk and 5 minutes of slaughtering hippies.Whoop dee doo.Do not waste your time on this dumpster fire of a film.", "For people over a certain age with time to kill": "If you are someone that lived during the sixties then you might like this movie; it will be a trip down memory lane.

The dialogue itself didn't blow my mind or anything but the way much of it was said was in this naturalistic, early Tarantino way not seen since Jackie Brown or Linklater's Boyhood; as opposed to overly-cool... which I liked. I found myself interested in what was going to happen next. The Bruce Lee scene didn't even bother me really. It was funny... and you know, maybe Bruce Lee was too full of himself. He didn't really win many tournaments. So...I dunno..I kinda had an issue with the ending. Hollywood vs the hippies. Ok, so maybe there were some \"crazy hippies\" but I wouldn't consider the Manson clan or the like real hippies. There was a genuine movement of peace and love and the legend goes, it was the psychopaths that started spiking the LSD for bad trips which ruined the movement. No idea how true that is, but wouldn't be surprised. Regardless it was still entertaining.", "Tarentino simplifies nothing": "This movie will probably be misunderstood.

The old-style shooting on film, using live locations with old school movie star charms also make this movie something of an anomaly in this age (2019). Many of the pleasures to be found in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood are better discovered on their own than revealed in a review. Valid criticisms can be leveled against Tarantino's latest - the most obvious of which relates to its length. There are times, especially late in the proceedings, when the narrative momentum flags and it becomes apparent that 161 minutes might have been too generous. The film's meandering approach, however, is as much an asset as a detriment. Although it contributes to the lack of cohesion, it allows Tarantino great freedom in advancing his characters' stories. He relies a little too much on nostalgia- but many of those bits still bring a smile to the face. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was made by a movie-lover for movie-lovers.", "Overall good but a little dry": "So, don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but it didn't feel like that it had too much going on. It started out decent, with the acting and the hippy stuff, but even then, you were like half way through the movie and still not much happened. Then the story once again just stops leading anywhere and just goes on it's track and bot much is happening, I really don't get why the part about his neighbors was important to the story, not much happened there. So anyway the story starts off with not much then some hippy stuff, then almost nothing and then some hippies getting getting killed, and then it's over. You get what I'm saying? Nothing really led up to anything and it was 2 and a half hours long. I enjoyed that time, but I think they could have squeezed that into an hour and a half or so, and write a story that has more going on with that remaining time.", "THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!": "I fell in love with this movie, not only is it written by the one and only Quentin Tarantino but the story is set in 1969 in Hollywood Los Angeles the set is so well created and realistic for 1969 . The film has such fascinating characters who where so well cast Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate who was a real Actress from that time.", "Not his best work, but it's up their at the top": "This is definitely Quentin Tarantino's funniest film yet. Just like all of his other movies this is very well written however instead of scenes written for suspense, their written for jokes and comedy. While most of his movies get you through their nearly 3 hour run time by keeping you on the edge of your seat with suspense, this movie has you laughing along and enjoying every second of the movie. I would argue it's just as effective at keeping you engaged in the movie. This movie reminds me of Kill Bill Vol. 2 in a way. Both are very slow and originally coming out of the theater I had mixed feelings on both of them. But as time goes on and after seeing them again I like both movies more and more. This is a very different movie for Tarantino but it is just as good. The main characters aren't famous criminals, or hitmen, or apart of a secret army. They're normal people you could have came across in Hollywood during that time and throughout the movie you mostly see how their daily life plays out. I find that to be amazing that he can make the daily life's of two people in 1969 Hollywood interesting for the majority of the movie. At the end of the day, it's not his best but I would put it in his top 3. It is definitely better than anything out in theaters right now.", "Long winded pretentious mess": "Remember that seinfeld episode when george said they wanted to make a show about nothing. well this is a movie about nothing.

Hollywood!\" Stars Faces such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, the movie runs a grueling length of 2 hours and 40 minutes a lot of the scenes in this film seem drawn out, unnecessary or lead no where. Some characters in the movie are completely pointless like Al Pacino and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate that have little screen time and their whole parts in the movie are needless and waste time. There's a pointless narrator that's makes worthless statements that are blatantly obvious if you just watch the film. Most of the events that happen in this movie end up leading to nothing making the plot and actual point of this movie confusing. Although the film is put together in a very weak way it has strong points, most of the scenes with Brad Pitt in them are pretty entertaining even if they're stupid and the ending to this movie is fun to watch despite it being totally out of left field. This might be Tarantino's weakest movie to date and I recommend skipping this.", "It's a different film by Quentin Tarantino": "Maybe I was just waiting to see more action, just like the previous movies from the director but then I found something more nostalgic and a different way to do some things.Awesome photography, good composition almost in the whole filmAwesome performance by every single actor. The attitude of Cliff was the best. He was my favourite character.The las 20 minutes and the fight with the Hippie in the Western studio were the best part of the whole film.

The movie is just so loaded with pointless audiovisual attraction. It made me remember Louis CK, after he had been the top comedian, he made a special about rape and how poor people should kill themselves. QT got to this level. On his - from my point of view - downward career he got to the point, where he just might have tried, with how much BS he can get away, and boy, did he carry a load. Kudos for the two male actors who kept this above water.

Leonardo DiCaprio was brilliant as always but that's where the brilliance stops. A movie with unnecessarily long shots, characters that you don't care about but foremost a story that you care even less about. I really felt that this film was created for people who work in the movie industry. I've been to a number of sets in my life and I've seen what directors and actors go through and this movie really showed what's going on behind the scenes but not everyone can relate to that. I'm sorry to say that this one was my least favorite movie of his, I really wanted to like it since he's my favorite director, but I just couldn't cling on to anything from this movie.", "It was good but something was missing...": "Acting was awesome...\nArt was amazing...\nPhotography was perfect...\nBut there was something in the plot that wasn't enough for me.", "Hollywood meets Hollywood": "This is an excellent film, a movie buffs' dream. The year 1969 was a year filled with exciting, historic and horrific events. The hippies, the new Hollywood versus the old, aging actors, youth versus the Establishment. Look at the settings, the nostalgia, the various characters, the events about to happen. Pop some popcorn, sit back and melt away into fantasy.", "Woody Allen's movie?": "Somehow I couldn't appreciate all the work made into Once upon a time in Hollywood. Generally speaking it is a quality movie. But I can't say it's a Tarantino movie.The first 80% of the movie make an impression that Woody Allen did it. Feels like his classic no-start-no-end story. By itself is not a bad thing. It's executed good and no one can blame a movie maker for exploring new directions.What is more, movie references were great, as usual. I especially liked a very meta reference to DiCaprio own playing in Django (when he slapped a glass with his hand).What I really missed are the things that Tarantino usually excels at - dialogs and logic. Character lines felt basic and kinda straightforward. But again, maybe it's a clever reference to the kind of dialogs that are to be found in movies of that time.\nBut what really killed the magic for me is the absence of logic and consistency - things that Tarantino was always great in. The movie contradicts itself in many points.The Allen-style drama is followed by a very violent scene. Worst of all, it feels completely unnecessary and separate from the rest. In Reservoir Dogs, Django and Hateful Eight the violence was a natural progression of the story. But in this movie nothing hints that a fluffy actor will be ok with burying an intruder alive with a flamethrower.Or the fact that DiCaprio character hated the idea to go to Rome. He played one of his roles great (in a Hollywood film), hinting that he may come back into a big game and forget about Italy... Boom, next shot and he's going to Rome. Why?!So there are many more contradictions like this. And that's the reason I can't put this movie on the same row with Tarantino's previous works.", "Is it me, or?": "This is basically Inglorious Bas***ds (IB) set in 1969 Los Angeles with less intrigue. Set the table, build, build build to the crescendo, and then revisionist history.The individual, character building scenes are as usual filled with great dialogue, but with less suspense then IB, a bit long, and slightly depressing.The characters have more depth, but they have to in order for the movie to succeed which I think it does overall, but in terms of the STORY, I was surprised at the laziness of QT in terms of not bringing anything new when compared to IB.The sets and the cinematography is a clear 10/10, and Oscar-worthy. The characters are rich, flawed, and the acting is amazing.On its own, this is a phenomenal film, but with IB preceding it, I can't get over the similarities and parallels of the two stories. Essentially a 2nd revisionist history QT movie.Help me with distinction...because I don't see it.", "Visually stunning, but a little drawn out": "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood (2019), regardless of anything else, is visually stunning. The colors and shots are brilliant. The feel of the movie is both fresh and new and comforting like an old friend.The acting in this film is well done. Brad Pitt's character is lovable and has you rooting for him, despite his flaws. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Sharon Tate is beyond pure. Perhaps it is just the character he is playing, but I found Leonardo DiCaprio to be trying almost too hard, as well Al Pacino's portrayal to be a bit stiff and unnatural. While I feel both are a bit overdone, they are still respectively very talented actors. Everyone else's portrayals came across very natural to me, allowing me to fall into the movie.I've only seen one other Tarantino film, but I found it was lacking in extreme trade-mark violence, other than a final scene. It's very intense, but a bit unrealistic. Still, it's hard to turn away.So while the movie at parts seemed drawn out, and in all honestly was absent of a plot, it made out to be a compelling watch purely for the stunning visuals, '60s nostalgia, and a twist of a tragic real-life event.", "Tarantino has been doing the same filme since Pulp Fiction.": "It's been so long I don't write a review here, I'm going to write a lot, but rest assured that everything is worth reading. I think that now is the time to warn the people who are thinking about wasting their time with Tarantino movies, so here it goes.Tarantino is an object of adoration among a ''group of people'', mostly of them female, because of Uma Thurman's character Mia Wallace and Travolta's uncompromising rescue of her comprised of fully consented misdemeanors. So due to this, Tarantino has been bathing in comfortable approval for 25 years. For that reason, he got a pass to keep doing the same movie for a very long time and I'm happy to be able catch a glimpse of its end. I don't think he can keep getting away with it and that is a good thing for us all. No other movies of him are worth mentioning.Tarantino movies are fetishist movies, he can bewitch his audience to enjoy the things they are supposed to despise. All of them have the same premise of ''straight face tension building'' to end in a release of graphic violence of ideological antagonists. The watcher enjoy some sort of catharsis and It all feels very similar with LVT movies, but worse, because it has no wits to it. At least the later is able to fool me. I think that at minute five or eight, he uses a plot device subterfuge to state that this is still a Tarantino movie and that his admires should keep watching, but it is so in the face that is gross. At that minute I knew, the emperor was naked after all.Minor SPOILERS ahead, tread carefully:\nNow that tables have turned, since he went to bite the hand that feeds him in this new movie, we are safe to have a go at him just because the best character, who is played by Brad Pitt, is apparently, an unapologetic misogynist who killed his wife, but learned to navigate the world and stay out of jail just fine. So with that sort of premise, we can easily point the finger at the reasons people are signaling to him that he should stop. Isn't it funny that I happen to agree with them, even if the reasons to do so are not the same?Well, I'm not going to waste your time like Tarantino did, so I'll go ahead and say the best and worst thing in the movie. The most clever thing in this movie that is worth mentioning and rating is a sort of ''metaplay'' between what Di Caprio's character, Rick Dalton, does in the movies he plays(he is an actor), and what Di Caprio's is actually doing in this movie(acting). He plays a once famous actor who is now coming to terms with not playing leading characters anymore, while at the same time, Pitt's character, Cliff Booth, is a unemployed ex-stuntman to Rick wich is depicted as a supporting role, but is actually leading it. This sort of anti-hero playing juxtaposing their conflicting ideals and still having them as best friends to one another is the chemistry that weaves this movie together. Rick Dalton is fragile, unstable and has many vices while Cliff Booth is reliable, strong and confident. These perks work together to underscore their characters flaws and qualities and I have to admit that this is very clever and why I rated it 4 stars, otherwise I would have rated it 1.I can't be sure, but at this point, I don't think there is no other review which have acknowledged the fact above, so in a way, they are not being honest with the director and I just wish they would. They are just displeased that he decided to poke at their insecurities, which is also another thing one can use to understand the characters while having fun at the same time, even after the movie is over. These people just can't handle to be criticized.The worst part about the movie is everything else. Cardboard characters that have no reason to be, have no depth. Even Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate, whose history serves just as a background to an anti-climax that is absolute distasteful. I'm not going to spoiler it not say what it all means, I'm just saying that his tricks are obvious and the only people who can be puzzled by it are the people complaining that ''they don't like him anymore''. I never liked his movies and I think his tricks are finally wearing off, which is a good thing.I hope you enjoy the movie, because I couldn't. It is slow and boring, but Pitt is wonderful as an unapologetic guy that nudges at his comic representation of Lt. Aldo Raine in Inglorious Basterds, which is also a bad movie.", "Really tried to love it": "I honestly love QT style. But this movie is nothing like his usual style. Except the same micro things like camera positions when shooting characters, dialogue and few other things. I believe QT wanted to experiment a little bit here and missed. Why?1. Usually his movies have very nice buildup of energy throughout the movie. Even when last 10 mins of movie are the real meat the whole piece has energy. This movie lacks this.\n2. Very powerful dialogues. Or at least one. I think i felt many such dialogues but with no connection to the main plot.\n3. Main plot. Very mild. It does amazing job of explaining what the move title says. Once upon a time in Hollywood. You get to feel late 60s. But main plot is just too focused on that. Missing real connection with characters introduced\n4. There is no wow moments. For me QT movies always had this wow moments even when they are short. This movie has none.\n5. It is piece of art that you need to have credibility or courage to pull out. Unfortunately this piece of art is not for majority.", "Good performances, but lacks focus": "Ever since Reservoir Dogs, I have been a fan of Tarantino. I have to say, Pitt and Leo give some pretty good performances as an actor and stuntman on the tail end of their careers. Love the cinematography. My main complaint revolves around the sudden switches to Polanski's life that seem to come out of nowhere. The movie insists to be focused on the duo, but seemingly at random, the story jumps to Polanski and Tate. It's quite jarring when it happens, and leaves you wondering why the hell you're seeing these scenes. If they were divided more evenly between the two households, it would work as to compare and contrast a star on his way out and a star who just got in the door, but the movie focuses so much on the former that the latter just seems out of place.Still, it was still quite enjoyable and serves as a bit of a time capsule of an interesting period of American history.", "Tarantino proves he's lost the plot": "Once again Tarantino has given us a film that could've been cut by at least an hour to try and make something less dreary and dialogue heavy. This is the Hateful Eight all over again. Too long, drawn out, ambling, with scenes that really don't need to be in the film. The Tate sequence in the cinema....yawn....DiCaprio fretting about his career...yawn....It feels like a patchwork quilt of a film that has been put together badly.\nIf there is one redeeming feature it's Pitt's and DiCaprio's performances which really do show the quality of them as actors, albeit Pitt steals the show and the limelight form DiCaprio, but maybe that's not fair on DiCaprio as his role is that of an actor who's been told he's on the slippery downward slope of his career if something doesn't change.\nTarantino can you ever repeat the sheer utter brilliance of Pulp Fiction? Somehow I doubt it.", "Huge disappointment": "Big fan of Quentin Tarantino but this has to be his worst movie. Could have easily been saved in the editing room. While I enjoy Quentin's conversation, that wasn't the problem with this film. Pointless story telling and over shot scenes make up the first two hours of the movie. Although there was meticulous detail to the period it wasn't enough to cary the film. While the end didn't play out as expected, that could have been regarded as fresh had the first two hours contributed anything to the film. The audible collective 'what was that' in the audience when the credits started to roll pretty much says it all. This was Brad Pitt's movie and he carried the film. Easy way to fix this movie, remove all scenes without Brad. You would have a tight continuous narrative, an interesting story without all the unwanted excess, and a much more reasonable running time.", "Don't waist your time!": "There is nothing good on this movie besides the similarity of the characters with the actual actors.\nNo history, and no story telling (I know it is a Tarantino's).\nVery few times I wanted to leave the theater in the middle of the movie....this was one of them\nIn the end, it is a line up of good actors with no story to tell.", "Not what you would expect...": "Tarantino seems to be letting the Manson clan tear his reputation to shreds in this one unfortunately. Why was Margot Robbie even in this film? So that we could watch her dance, walk around Hollywood, watch her own movie in a theater, and then say 20 lines at the end??? I haven't been this disappointed in a movie in quite some time", "No \"Pulp Fiction\"": "Perhaps because of the hype, the director, and the cast, my hopes were set too high. I enjoyed much of the movie but here were so many random, endless, self-indulgent scenes that added little to the movie that I found myself checking the time frequently (never a good sign). My favorite character was the dog, followed by Pitt who just gets cuter with age. I liked the setting, the 60's vibe - if only there was editing, I would have really enjoyed this movie.", "Meandering and meaningless": "I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. I was entertained, but I was also at a loss to really appreciate what or where the story was going; or is that just naive of me, because this is 'art'? Too long, meandering, and indulgent. That man needs to either employ a better editor, or-more likely-listen to the one he has.I suspect that if you go into the theatre with a better understanding of the Manson Murders of 1969 you might get more out of it... Maybe as Brit I'm less aware of this event, maybe in the US is well known? Send strange to assume everyone who watches this film will me familiar with it.", "Once Upon a Time....in Hollywood": "Movie started a little slow for first hour bud got better as it went along. Definitely recommend it", "Good but not great": "I liked a lot about this movie. I liked the soundtrack, the casting, the \"look and feel\" of the movie, and the subject matter. But honestly, I felt like the script and the plot lagged. I wanted to love it but I didn't, and that was the general consensus of people leaving the theater afterwards as well. I would say that I don't regret watching it, but I do regret paying to watch it in a theater and paying for their popcorn! I wish I'd waited to watch it at home and made my own popcorn.", "And......": "Read the reviews and decided to give it a go. We watched it over 3 days as it we didn't get it. I'm no film buff, I like a good story that's all. A tribute to Hollywood apparently. Isn't that what the Oscars are for. The acting was good, but for me there needs to be a plot. And the bizarre violence at the end, did Tarantino realise that people would want a story, but realised too late to change the beginning!", "Entertaining even without a plot": "The movie isn't slow like some people are saying, it just lacks a deep plot. Everything feels very shallow, like QT wanted to make a compilation of short hollywood tales. The pace is good, makes you laugh a lot with clever dialogues but you just keep wondering when the QT style will pop up, which happens only in the last 15 minutes. So for 2 and a half hours I was happy, anxious and delighted by the actors performance, but feeling really empty.Also, you MUST know who was Charles Manson and Sharon Tate BEFORE seeing the movie, otherwise everything will makes no sense. I know this may be very trivial for americans, but on other countries (Brazil, in my case) the murder didn't have the same repercussions and lots of people doesn't remember who they were. I know its a movie made in America, by an american, for americans with every possible reference to their culture, but Quentin knows he has a huge audience all over the world, and didn't even bother in saying Charlie surname to refresh the memory of those who were lost.", "Unrealistic": "There is a girl. She is into you or pretends to be and wants you to do her. You are a man (even single) and she is not fat, tattooed or whatever. What do you do? Say NO!?!?!?! Er, screech halt, whaaaaaaat???\nThis movie lost me.", "Rating is based on two main components: Acting/Direction & Script": "When you plan to watch a movie with almost 3 hours screen time you first ask yourself am I going to get bored? am I going to lose focus and be distracted with something else?. Here with tarantino movie the actors are brilliant (expected!) there are some intense scenes that are really satisfying also this is applied to the direction. But when it comes to the script one can really say it has some emptiness and void and at some point you are going to ask (what does the writer and the director want to deliver).. there are only scenes floating but not a target end.. there is no storyline that you can ask at the end ( it was sad to end like this, it was shock, Iam satisfied, Iam happy etc..) it is just nutral chronicles.", "So Much Skill and Talent...Wasted": "Watched Once Upon a Time in Hollywood last night. Beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, and an amazing recreation of 1969 Hollywood, all in service of a plot that's just not very compelling. The story of an aging 1950s TV actor can't carry a movie with a 2 hour, 45 minute running time. Tarantino seems to realize this and tacks on a weird, fantasyland version of the Manson Family murders for the last 45 minutes. This is, sadly, Tarantino at his most self indulgent. It's a shame to see so much talent wasted on a movie that adds up to so little in the end.", ".Unspeakably bad. Don't be fooled by the trailer.": "Worst film of the year so far. Horrendously written, rambling confused plotlines, so many scenes that served no tangible purpose, nothing fully explored, average direction at best. 160mins of pointless scene after pointless scene, with virtually no sense of interconnectedness or relevancy at all. They're just all loosely strung together and go absolutely nowhere.The movie in a nutshell: Pitt driving his car, with \"period music\" playing (how original & clever, totally unlike Goodfellas, Wolf of Wall St, Casino, American Hustle, Almost Famous, Apollo 11, Full Metal Jacket, Air America, & a plethora of other films).... just repeatedly driving.... again & again &..... again & again, & again.... then a cheesy scene of DiCaprio overacting (as usual), again & again & again.... meandering almost random scenes that literally mean nothing, add nothing, and last waaaaay too long.Leo simply cannot act (people who say he can are either <20 or retarded); his idea of acting is screaming, crying, or acting like he's on drugs.... copy & paste of Wolf of Wall Street in other words.5 great actors - Hirsch, Dern, Madsen, Russell, & Pacino - are all totally wasted. Luke Perry's illustrious final \"performance\" was the definition of a non-event. Margot Robbie's also wasted. In a lengthy scene that lasts forever, we watch her sassily talk her way into a screening of her latest film.... then follow her inside.... then watch her watching her film.... yes, read that again. THIS is \"entertainment\" in a Tarantino film now! Watching a girl laughing while watching another film!Pitt is extremely bland: in another scene that lasts forever, we watch Pitt pick up an (over-acting) adolescent hitchhiker.... take her to her (Manson's) ranch.... creepy girls & some guys lingering around.... he asks to see the owner in the house, they creepily decline.... he insists.... they more menacingly decline.... he says he's going in anyway.... oh my god, what's going to happen??!!?!!!! Nothing!!! That's what! He has a chat with the guy, then leaves!!!! What the.... after allll thaaat... christ....Then finally, after over 2 hours of NOTHING, we get 15mins of brutal bloodshed - absolute viciousness, perpetrated by our \"heroes\" Brad & Leo (& Brad's sweet killer pitbull) against 3 \"evil hippies\".The whole film is nothing but a self-gratifying glorification of the egos of the director and main actors. And pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease don't get me started on that absolutely disgusting pathetic abhorrent utterly fictitious nonsensical scene with Bruce Lee... the director's clearly also pushing (subliminal) personal agendas with this film, i.e.: Bruce Lee and hippies suck. This isn't just Tarantino's worst film, it's one of the worst films ever made, period. Tarantino can't retire soon enough.I had to watch No Country for Old Men & Fatal Attraction twice each, just to erase this trainwreck from my memory.", "Missed the mark for Me...": "Dont get me wrong, I love Tarantino. From Reservoir Dogs all the way to The Hateful Eight I've really found things to love about all those films. This one? Just felt disjointed and in need of some editing. Seems a lot of scenes were just pointless.Music? Check. Acting? Check. Cinematography? Check? Script? Eh I don't know. The Last act picked up and was a lot more fun but overall was just bored with this one.I'm sure with repeat viewings I'll get what QT was doing here and my rating could change. I did wonder if we all have some viewer bias when the name QT is attached to it.", "Believe me, don't waste your time!": "This is the worst movie I watched for Leo! I bet your grandma will plot a better story than this rubbish.", "Plenty of nostalgia not enough substance": "Tarantino has a style of his own. Others have tried to emulate it over the years, but it's not the same. I've seen all his movies (personally my fav is reservoir dogs) and I love how he tells and ends his movies. This one was the first time where I was bewildered after the end of it. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography, the soundtrack and casting were first rate. The 1969 setting was flawless, right down to the very minor detail. The soundtrack was awesome, I could never fault Tarantino on this subject because I know it's a passion of his. DiCaprio was good as Rick Dalton but I doubt he had to extend his range much because he just channelled how he was before he won his academy award for The Reverant. Robbie was beautiful and free spirited as Sharon Tate but she was massively under used. Too be honest you probably wouldn't even know she was playing Tate until she went to the movie theatre and announced she was Sharon Tate and that she didn't want to pay 75c for a movie ticket. Pacino was good as Marvin Shwarz but let's be honest, he is just playing himself. My favourites were Pitt and Russell playing Cliff Booth and Randy/ Narrator respectively. Maybe because they bring more of a comedic approach to their characters, I'm not sure but they stand out more to me. The story seems more random then other Tarantino movies and the end doesn't really justify the means. I'm not asking for an explosive conclusion like Jdango Unchained but something that satisfies how the film has presented itself. And considering the backdrop and material, 1969, golden age of cinema about to close, the Manson family at their worst, Sharon Tates tragic death. It was pretty much wasted", "Once upon a time forgettable movie": "Boring boring boring. I don't really know what and how this movie got funded. Maybe the big names Tarantino, Pitt and Decaprio got the funding but there was no real plot. Would not recommend this movie my worst enemy.", "Thoughts on the 9th film by Mr Tarantino (with some advise)...": "Just by looking at the cast you can see many Actors who you would somewhat expect to take the lead and supporting roles, such as Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Emile Hirsch and of course Al Pacino, although not uncommon for a Tarantino film to feature relatively 'small' roles for A listing Actors, I couldn't help but think this may have been done to an extent where it almost seems the film tried to squeeze in as many big names as possible similar to the Expendables franchise, and this just doesn't work as we lack character development and the joy of a tasteful cameo. This doesn't exclude historical figure cameos in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood also; Bruce Lee, Roman Polanski and everyone's favourite Hippy Cult Leader Charles Manson also have painfully small parts in this almost three hour film. This is not to say I didn't appreciate and enjoy the Cameos from these figures. Bruce Lee's was a personal favourite, however Manson's was too short to comment on, you probably saw him as much in the film as you did in the trailer, and although I respect the synopsis has little to do with Charlie, his feature in this film was equivalent to having a bite-size free sample of your favourite cake...you had the taster and you wanted more. (Damon Herriman who portrayed Chales Manson in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood also plays Charlie in Mindhunter season 2 episode 5 and does a great job of it too, so feel free to have a look). To summarise expect spouts of utter brilliance from top actors playing other actors (and cult murders), however understand these appearances are brief at best.Moving swiftly on to the three main characters i'll start with DiCaprio who plays Hollywood Actor Rick Dalton. His performance was simply magnificent I can't stress enough how convincing his character was as an actor. I can only assume it takes tremendous talent to be an Actor acting as an Actor whose acting; a ten out of ten for Leo. Then there's of course Brad Pitt who plays Daltons stunt double Cliff Booth, his characters a very likeable one and without going into depth will without a doubt be all the viewers favourite character, his charismatic and 'bad ass' attitude is everything you want in your stereotypical cool guy, similar to his role as Tyler Durden in Fight Club. Then theres of course Margot Robbie who portrays Sharron Tate her dialogue was limited and when questioned on the reasons as to why this is, QT declined to comment. Unusual for a lead to have limited dialogue in a Tarantino film, but in his defence Robbie's character was a happy 'in a world of her own' type who didn't particularly need to say too much, as she was either dancing or viewing her own films in the majority of this film. We are all of course familiar with the Brutal fate of Sharron Tate at the hand of Manson Family in 1969, however understand a Tarantino film is unlikely to follow true events in his masterpieces, after all the title itself suggests fiction, however I will not confirm or deny anything. The build up and suspense to the reveal of the outcome to Sharron Tate's story in this film are truly gripping and possibly the best parts of this film.This film is everything you expect from the title its very 60's retro Hollywood. As with most Tarantino Movies there are lengthy scenes with lots of dialogue, red apple cigarettes and lots of feet. What would a QT film be without feet, so if that's your thing you're in for a treat. There are other classical Tarantino themes such as third party narration, however in this film Kurt Russell does the honours, as opposed to Samuel L Jackson who of course narrated in the Hateful Eight and Inglorious Bast*rds. We also lose the 'chapters' as seen in the likes of kill Bill and the Hateful Eight, and is replaced with dates to offer a more factual perspective for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. One noticeable theme to the film was that unlike most QT movies this was much more comical than bloody, so be sure to have a more open mind to a somewhat risky but brilliant movie, and check out the looper and watchmojo YouTube videos after watching, as there's a lot of interesting content and facts relating to this movie on their channels.I originally gave this film a seven as it's not your typical cinematic masterpiece you would expect from Mr Tarantino, however be assured this was a fantastic film, that I was able to convince myself I enjoyed much more as I analysed it after watching, which ultimately altered my score to a very respectable Eight.FYI be sure to stay for the end credits scene, regardless of how much you need to use the facilities after a lengthy viewing.Thanks for reading!", "What was that?!!": "Like inglorious bastard this feels like a what if...sounds like a good story but it took over 2 hrs to tell it. I just didn't get the point of it all", "Tarantino is back in style": "Once upon a time in Hollywood review\nRating 8.3/10Overall this film is exactly what you think a Tarantino film is, it's wacky, vibrant and it perfectly represents the time of history it is set in. Through set design, film editing and even adverts on the radio. Also with Tarantino films the dialogue is as sharp and witty as ever.The music through this film, makes you feel like you are in the Cadillacs with the characters like rick and cliff. Like you are either a hippy child with Manson or just a regular LA citizen living another day in the life of an average joe in the swinging sixties.Also the film editing to show rick in his past/ present films/ tv shows is flawless and really displays what a talented team Tarantino has around him and you cannot blame them for being nominated for so many awards for this, I almost believed that it was rick dalton in that episode of the fbi instead of the originals Burt Reynolds episode.Brad Pitt puts in one of his most memorable performances in years, this character of cliff really ties in to his personal persona of a mature guy who is not really too bothered about the fame and notoriety he gets with the roles he plays, Brad Pitt will always be eternally cool but this role has cemented him amongst the few actors who can overcome the stereotype of being just a good looking actor, an actor who has depth and who has shown growth throughout his career, Brad Pitt is so much more than just a heartthrob and if people did not see this before this film then they will surely see it now. Cliff is funny, caring and protective this film displayed an example of a role and an actor fitting like a tailor made Armani suit.Next we come to Margot Robbie who takes the role of the timeless sweetheart Sharon Tate, the film star who was supposed to become the next global superstar. She was one half of one of the original power couples who ruled not just the Hollywood film scene but the global film industry. In the film Margot Robbie portrays Sharon Tate exactly how she was in real life, this was down to Sharon's sister coming on set and having private meetings with miss Robbie and Quentin. I believe this is Margot Robbie's best performance I believe it beats the angered role of Jordan Belford's second wife Naomi in Scorsese's wolf of Wall Street. I think this film shows how Robbie can represent a figure of history and how according to family and close people to miss Tate can show the love and compassion she had for the world before her tragic passing, even in limited screen time.Leonardo dicaprio's performance in this film beats his performance in the departed and his performance in the blood diamond and even in his Oscar winning performance of the revenant. He plays rick dalton who is the complete the opposite actor of dicaprio, he is an actor that is fading, is limited to the roles he can play, forgets his lines and is unreliable as well as insecure. To play this type of actor being the perfectionist and being the multi layered actor that dicaprio is must have have been extremely difficult for him. I believe the improvised scene in his trailer is one of the best scenes I have ever seen from dicaprio it's almost like he is angry at his character for making him act like this, making him act insecure like this, not sure about his future. Taking this role for dicaprio could have been career suicide especially with a director of Tarantino's reputation and to nail this role in the way he did once again shows that he along with Pitt should belong in the acting hall of fame.If I am to sum all of this film up then I would say I am looking forward to Tarantino's final movie which will be his 10th film as I believe he recaptured the magic after the hateful 8 and I believe he can once again make a brilliant movie as well that's why I give this a 8.3/10.", "Tarantino the most overrated director?": "If I could i would give this movie minus, its top five crappiest movies i have ever seen. If you not a hardcore Tarantino fan \"i felt the movie inside me, The characters the soundtrack\" etc etc then big heads up! DONT SEE IT you Will be disapointed.", "Once upon a time when Quentin Tarantino still had it.": "After eagerly waiting for this movie to drop, I was quite disappointed really. Very soft plot, struggled to stay occupied. What I will say is DiCaprio is on his usual top form in this film, quite frankly top draw performance as we've become accustomed to witnessing. Not even in the top 10 Tarantino films, still worth a watch though.Just a 7 out of 10.", "I'm just confused...": "Not the typical Tarantino experience for me. I couldn't follow along with the story and just left the theatre confused.", "Amazing for what it is....": "Like most people, outside of documentaries,I often look to motion pictures to\n(A) Take me away from reality, and...\n(B) if they are REALLY good, change my outlook on reality.\nIf a motion picture accomplishes both, I consider it a film, otherwise, it is a movie.\nIt's the difference between a hamburger (movie) and fine cuisine (film).\n\"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" (OUATIH) ends up being a really, really good hamburger.\nIt has so many plot lines going on at once to keep you interested, that only a few times did I check my watch (I went to the late show, and the movie is almost 3 hours long.)\nThe various plot lines are well developed, but do not get too esoteric between the characters. This can be a good or bad thing. I think Pitt and DiCaprio's characters come the closest to revealing their actual characters both through their actions and their lines. There is so much chemistry between the two leads that something magical has to happen, and watching these two together is worth the ticket price. The only possible revelation that does happen is DiCaprio's slow understanding how he is becoming a has-been, the unhappy acceptance of this, and then rebuilding of his pride and character.\nPitt's character does not change much; he is happy to be the pillar that supports DiCaprio. From the start, he is a no-nonsense, flawed, but good hearted character. He is the always supportive friend who has stuck with Dicaprio from day one.\nHe is the personification of his dog, in that he is loyal, protective, and can be violent, but usually for good cause.Alone, a movie about two guys who support one another to overcome adversity wouldn't make it very far.The brilliance in this movie also comes from three other aspects.One is the myriad of supporting actors; many of whom have worked for Tarantino before. It's like a Tarantino reunion. All the supporting actors do absolutely brilliant work. From Mike Moh acting as Bruce Lee, to the 10 YO prodigy Julia Butters who is the (more) professional actor working alongside DiCaprio on the set of \"Lancer\".\nThese sub stories add a lot to the film, and just as quickly as they make their appearance, they are gone, but do show up later in the film as recognizable old friends.Secondly, although revisionist and \"based on a true story\", the film does capture another time. Being shot on 35mm film stock, and alluding to events of the time, it makes the viewer feel as if they are in 1969 Hollywood. The sets are absolutely amazing. I won't delve into this or the Manson discussion. It just goes to show how many different elements of culture were mixing in the 60's, before the era came to an abrupt end with Altamont and the Manson killings. This film captures that moment before water boils; it gets quiet and calm, but just for a few seconds.Finally, and I believe most importantly, is the way that Tarantino plays with the film medium. He explores spaghetti westerns, shows clips of fictional movies, and real movies. Pauses the film, shows TV clips on TV sets in a movie, has his favourite films on marquees, and on and on. It is almost, but not quite, to the point of overload. He replaces McQueen with DiCaprio in \"The Great Escape\". It is hard to see where reality ends and Tarantino's fictional clips begin. He shows TV shows within a movie, and he does such a good job of replicating TV westerns that you forget the footage is contemporary. This is a really fun aspect of the whole project.Ultimately, Tarantino is a great movie writer/director. The film does not disappoint at all, but there is no greater point to it. Yes, the sum is greater than the whole of its parts, and you will leave the theatre entertained, but you will not be left questioning your existence. If you are looking for smart, male centered drama, without (thankfully) too much of the violence that Tarantino can't seem to make a movie without, you won't be disappointed.", "Like Tarantino threw his talent out of the window while making it": "Just that you know, I am pretty generous giving this film 8/10 because for a film with a good backstory, a spectacular director and the best cast ever - the screenplay was dreadful. The story moves slow and very few interesting parts with no point.Be careful because the next part contains a bit of a spoiler.The film starts as what looks like a story about two actors in Hollywood, and another girl. But the film all the time cuts to new paths and gets a bit like a west coast movie and then like a horror film and at the end a low budget action film. This film is a disgrace.\nOne thing was perfect and I mean it- the actors were AMAZING. Not a single bad actor and Brad Pitt deserves that Oscar.\nThat's all. I don't recommend if you are not bored.", "If you like Tarantino you gonna like this movie": "It's not his best work (or at least not my fav) but it's a little piece of art in the film industry. Great job Tarantino (:", "Unlike any movie I have ever seen before": "I have never seen a movie like this before. Warning: it's a slow movie, and it's not the typical Quentin Tarantino-actionmovie.\nThis movie builds up slow. You go through the exciting life of these moviestars. You don't know what's going to happen, but if you have a bit of background information, you feel the constant suspense. You know something is going to happen, but you don't know when or how. At some point it does get a bit too slow and you start to wonder \"is this even going somewhere\".It's afterwards when you realize the greatness of this movie, the brilliance of the director. And he even puts in a little gift at the end.", "Manson's iconic attack": "\"What if Charlie Manson's iconic attack on L. A.'s posh entertainment personas had been done instead against, um, a more down-to-earth kind of guy?\" - seems to be the central question of this look at late-'60s California culture, inundated with incessant media aimed at pleasure and mayhem. At the same time, we nonchalantly follow a faded actor's attempts to resuscitate his career while in this environment, as well as those of his stuntman best friend. These adventures are interesting but unimportant to the plot, which nevertheless (like a typical Tarantino) culminates in a violent climax. Is it worth watching again? Don't doubt it. Great realization? Unbelievable.", "Not my Favorite Tarantino Film": "I have been a die hard Tarantino fan since seeing Reservoir dogs as a teenager. This film didn't meet my subjective expectations. The acting, soundtrack and cinematography were all great. Did not appreciate or even follow the story line, what was the point? The ending from an alternate universe standpoint. The last 20 minutes was the highlight.", "Greatest Tribute to Hollywood.": "Changing his usual gear without completely losing his essence, Tarantino pays his tribute to Hollywood.", "Personally. I love this film.": "One I could watch again and again. The acting, writing, set design, cinematography are all on par with Tarantino's reputation. And the ending (kisses finger tips), masterful.", "Brad Pitt steals the show!": "This movie didn't have a storyline like Django or inglorious bastards or kill bill or any other QT movie. But was I disappointed? No. This movie didn't need a story or a bang like his other movies. It was a homage to late 60's hollywood and lives of people around the era in that time, not lives of superstars but someone like a stunt double played by Brad Pitt. There is lot of loneliness in this movie and that's what I take away from this movie. Both leo and brad's character are of lonely men, however, brad's character happy at whatever life throws at him and never loses his sense of humor or backs away from any challenges. In every scene, Brad Pitt was awesome and what a mature performance it was. It wasn't like fightclub or inglorious bastards, it was character of a man who understands life and have gotten over everything life threw at him and keeps enjoying life as it is. Leonardo's character is coming in terms with these challenges. I always thought if these two did a movie together, Leonardo would overshadow brad pitt. But that wasn't the case. Leo was great in his role but Brad carried the movie throughout. I do think there could have been more actions. The build up was okay but there should have been more action scenes in that ranch where he meets the Mansen family and climax was good but feels like an appetizer compare to what we are used to seeing from tarantino. A perfect movie would have been less leonardo acting in those tv shooting as an actor and more building up the suspense around the mansen family. But still, its worth the watch and especially for Brad Pitt's performance. I thought Al Pacino and Kurt Russell usage were inconsequential. But yeah, I found the movie to be philosophical and if you can relate to it that way with your own unique meaning then it is great. We all felt loneliness at some point in time. But what's one outlook in life can make all the difference. I can't imagine any other hollywood actor play the role of Cliff Booth other than Brad Pitt, that's how good he was!", "Without question Tarantino's worst ever film.": "A stunningly bad film which grotesquely twists a tragic real-life story in such bad taste it's hard to believe any of the massive stars gave it a second read. And to those who claim, \"irony\", then I say \"rubbish\".No plot, no connection between the numerous gratuitous, pointless vignettes and almost no script.The only saving graces were di Caprio and Point - the former was brilliant as ever, whikst the latter played Brad Pitt really well. They get a star each, the movie itself gets none.Younger viewers will not understand the shock felt by the world at the Tate murder(s) and not comprehend just how poor taste the 'happy ever ending' really is.", "I thought it was just ok": "I think I was expecting so much more, I enjoyed the ending, but that was it really. The film felt like it was just rolling along. Can't wait for number 10 though.", "Equal of Quentin's Cinematography, Unique Storytelling, and AMAZING Casting": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, not only is it one of my favorite Tarantino films of all time. It is a perfect mix of history, unique filmmaking, and Tarantino's violence we all love! A little lengthy, but an excellent film... cannot wait for your 10th film Quentin.", "Wasn't feeling it": "I love Tarantino films but this one was boring and had an uninteresting plot.The entire film is basically Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio characters smoking cigarettes while Tarantino shows you how much he loves women's feet with frequent close up shots of Margot Robbies soles.I was expecting witty and clever scenes and dialogue but there's none of that. You get dull scenes where they talk about films from 50 years ago. How boring.I wasn't feeling this film", "Too Meta....A movie that only Hollywood could love.": "As a die-hard Tarantino fan I felt a tad let-down by this, his latest effort (and last if we are to believe what he's been saying) It's just too self-referential, which makes it difficult to fully get into the characters and the plot....wait....was there a plot? There seemed to be a thin veneer of a plot, which is not un-Tarantino like; but it seemed to wander aimlessly at times. While it has it's moments (mostly of the surreal variety), I feel like this was a movie made for Hollywood. Almost an inside joke for Hollywood insiders....and a movie that only Hollywood could love.", "No Plot, No Meaning, Nothing": "I think this movie makes it in the top 3 of the worst movies I have ever seen. Almost 3 hours of nothingness. I haven't seen QT movies but I am wondering how he got successful making movies. I could produce a better movie. Save your self some money and go for dinner instead of watching this movie.", "I had fun watching this": "This movie was really good I like the cinematography of the film and I like the cast that was chosen. For me the ultimate point of the movie was about A declining actor who is trying to save his career but I felt like through out the entire movie I was waiting for more to happened and when it ended I felt like there was a good size chunk of info I was missing. When the manson family was Introduced in the film it kept it interesting. I would watch it if you haven't yet it's worth checking out as I am a huge fan of all of his movies and if you are too you'll enjoy this one.", "could be much greater": "I will give 10/10 to the great actors and music and camera and everything but zero to the director or the man who is responsible to give the final movie edition\ngreat acting scenes but there was no connection between the scenes. lots of scenes if removed from the movie, will not make any difference to the audience\nthere is no upgrade in the movie story. you are not waiting for something to happen next. you feel no difference between the minute 1 and minute 90. this movie could be one of the greatest ever, if the story was more connected to give a final controlled meaning", "Struggling to stay awake.": "I love Tarantino movies and I have been looking forward for this one a long time. Now I have seen it and I have to says it's a terrible movie. If a normal doesn't have me after 30/45 min I stop watching but because it's from Quentin I keep on watching for 2 hours and 41 minutes. And when the credit starts I realize I have wasted almost 3 hours of my life.", "This is Hollywood baby": "One of the best movies i've seen and of course it's from one of the greatest filmmaker that has ever lived.", "Badest movie ever!": "The movie has neither an action nor a connection. At no time comes tension and you get bored very fast. Due to the length of the film, this was bordering on torture.", "Leo is the only good thing about this movie": "Terrible writing and editing. Aging brad Pitt with cringeworthy flirting scenes with a girl young enough to be his granddaughter. Leo was on point though, and the ONLY good thing about this movie.", "Good Movie with lots of subtext": "I've seen this movie a couple times. I'm just wondering if anyone thinks that DiCaprio's character needs to see a medical doctor.", "You must watch !!!! So you learn !": "That's not a movie that's something else but I recommend you to watch it", "Once a waste of time": "I was looking forward to watching this movie as love all the previous QT movies but I didn't get this film at all! The film lacked a decent plot , very little witty dialogue and one short disturbingly violent scene ! I watched it to the end but quite possibly the worst film I have seen and another example of using top tier actors to carry a film that lacked so much!...just my opinion though as clearly other viewers got a lot more out of this film than me . Thoroughly disappointing :(", "Enjoy the ride -- the ending is worth it!": "I can see why another reviewer wrote that \"this film will certainly divide audiences.\" However, if you grew up in the 60s & 70s (like I did) or if you're just fascinated by that era, and if you know a good bit about the history of the Manson Family, then you should definitely enjoy this film! Although it's almost 3 hours, it didn't seem that way to me, and I would like to see the rumored extended version (not to mention deleted & alternate scenes). I especially liked Tarantino's skillful interweaving of facts (from the late 60s) with fiction. Although the film did seem to \"meander\" in some places, it's mainly for character development and/or plot misdirection because the ultimate premise of the film is this: \"What might have happened if the Manson Family killers had (accidentally) gone to a different house on the night of 8-9 Aug. 1969 (i.e., not the intended Polanksi-Tate house)?\". In fact, I came to like most of the characters so much that I feared what was going to happen to them at the end (based on my knowledge of history). However, in a wonderful and unexpected plot twist at the end, Tarantino merges the various storylines and brings the film to a close in a much more satisfying way (complete with plenty of his characteristic blood, violence, & chaos).", "I played with my phone during the movie= boring": "I ve never imagined that a Tarantino movie would force me to grab my phone to tolerate the very boring script. Only at the end something wake me up a little but was too late...\nIt began full of promises that later never arrive to a solid interesting idea, it needs some heavy edition cut ....a 90 min movie it would be a clever choice..\nMaybe Next time...", "Dropped the ball": "In his heyday Tarantino was unbeatable, with the likes of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp fiction being modern masterpieces. Latterly Kill Bill, Inglorious basterds (80% anyway) and Django proved excellent too, but in my opinion his latest efforts have been well below par. Once upon a time in Hollywood is overly long, poorly paced, and dialogue is uninteresting. I spent the majority of the film expecting something exciting to happen... But it just didn't! Then when you've all but given up there's a sudden, unexpected and gratuitously ultraviolent scene right at the end which doesn't fit in at all. I'm not saying it's badly made, just what's the point?!", "Probably the worst movie ever made": "There is nothing happening in this movie, nothing. The most boring film ever made, many people at the cinema left in the middle of the movie. We made it all the way thru somehow, but we felt ripped off. It's worth seing it for the same reason people see \"The Room\" or other catastrophically bad movies just fur the fun of it. A true piece of crap. I gave it 2 stars for the cinematography and the effort put in by the actors.", "Tarantino pulls through with the most loved violence": "First fell asleep for the first half of Tarantino long dialogues but the violence was exciting as only Q can deliver!

Just kept watching and watching. I kept telling myself \"why needed this scene?\" or it is too slow...\nAnd in the end it just finished as nothing happened.\nAlright we have seen 60s, retro and else but movie is just nonesense.", "Not a typical Tarantino flick": "However, also not one of his best movies.

This my friends ,is the keystone to a very special film and that is exactly what this movie turned out to be. Tarantino has grown up , he was already nearly that in his previous film,The Hateful Eight. Almost . Here his balls has dropped . This movie he became an adult. All his movies are very good and enjoyable. PulpFiction is still his best and will always be that , Jacky Brown was amazing, but once upon a time in Hollywood is dripped in nostalgia magic only great directors can make ,it's a magic only a few can take out of their magic hat, Boogie nights PTA comes to mind . We are transported to a time that is so real but long gone , the atmosphere of the late sixties is so real it's almost magical. This film has the right actors ,music , direction , atmosphere ,it's detail is really amazing . It's a slow paced film,it's a film that needs to be experienced, it's very like a good 70s movie , this also is a dying thing in today's cinema . I could write 10 pages of praise but you already probably know absolutely positively reading my short review that this latest QT is a winner and a must see masterpiece.", "this movie is a disapointement": "With all the good actors , this movie really really sucks.", "Changing History...again": "First, let me start this by saying I have always detested anything touched by Quentin Tarantino before I even watched this latest installment of revisionist history. I have never understood the fascination with anything he has written, directed, produced and lent his sneering looks to.I would hate to think it was he that chose Salma to dance with the snake as that would be his only saving grace. I was determined to give him another go so I avoided reviews and synopses of this, his latest attempt at movie making. Why should I trust a guy who has made a generation of undereducated kids think that 'basterds' is an accepted spelling for illegitimacy?This installment is the latest attempt to trivialize the some of the darkest events that generations of us remember. The Manson murders happened and nothing will change that and I'm surprised that any actor would get on board to portray heroism that never happened. A shame that.If you want to know what Quentin Tarantino stands for go slip and slide in the garage gore with misters White, Orange, Pink, Blue, Brown and Blonde. That should tell you all you need to know about his filmmaking. Yuck.", "This one does not count.": "Tarantino said that he will make 10 movies and than go to retirement. This movie was his 9th, but he need to shoot two more because this one does not count. I left theater after one hour with big question mark above my head.", "Washed out actor or a review of a society which doesn't see its own reflection.": "I normally like QT movies but after about 50mins I thought this is crap. It got going QT style after about 1hr50m. Really would've been better switching the focus to what the last scenes were about and spend 20 mins on the washed up actor. A society that feeds its citizens with unhealthy food and unhealthy entertainment might just deserve to see it's own reflection as it arguably doesn't see it at present. and would make a far more interesting movie.", "What Happened to Tarantino?": "Used to be a huge fan but his last couple of movies have been terrible. As other reviewers said, I'm waiting and waiting for this movie to get interesting. At about an hour in I am going to give up. I paid to rent it but am just too bored to cre anymore.", "Lore, Gore, and Historical Fiction": "What's at the Heart of Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood\n(no spoilers)One of the greatest parts of a Quentin Tarantino story is the element of camaraderie. Exposition scenes in movies are often dull and technical, but in the Tarantino multiverse it's a delight to watch characters work together, plan a caper, or get out of a tight spot.With subtext and clever dialog, the writer-director builds anticipation while establishing believable relationships; he takes his time, allowing us to get to know his characters, warts and all. Too many movies these days rush the plot forward without giving the audience a chance to care.But this is all common knowledge to Tarantino fanboys and girls.In his 9th film, Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino invites us to hang out with lovable losers, Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, in a fabled history of Los Angeles 1969. Rick (Leonardo Dicaprio) is a washed up TV actor whose only real friend, Cliff (Brad Pitt) serves as his stunt double, driver, and house sitter.It's difficult not to immediately love this duo. We see Rick mope around movie sets, stuttering, occasionally sobbing over a stale career. He's overly sentimental which is both hilarious and sad; it's not a typical role for Leonardo Dicaprio. One of the most fun aspects of this film is watching Dicaprio do some superbly bad acting as well as some genuinely great acting.We take comfort that Rick has Cliff nearby: a seasoned stunt man and war vet who looks out for Rick and knows exactly when his blubbering pal needs a pep talk. Cliff Booth might be the coolest character the director ever created. A cowboy in the modern era. He's quiet and tough, and his short bursts of action and combat are riveting. It's the most athleticism we've seen from Brad Pitt since Fight Club.What's especially memorable about these guys is their status as aging characters who get in over their head - a theme Tarantino has explored several times. (Freddy Newendyke in Reservoir dogs, Jackie in Jackie Brown, Lt. Aldo Rain in Inglorious Basterds.) Regarded as squares by 1969 standards, they barely hold their value in Hollywood. But the more we hang out with them, the more we love them for their loyalty and unpretentiousness. Such affection for these two might have the audience wondering: wouldn't it be great to see a bigger Rick & Cliff adventure in this film?Seeing this movie, especially in a crowded theatre, is absolutely a fun time. There are plenty of laughs, some tension and suspense here and there, and several sad-beautiful moments with Sharon Tate. What's more, the revisionist history makes for a very compelling watch; it plays to the height of the audience's intelligence, tasking the viewer to sort out the facts and interpret the third act for themselves.It's a smart movie.But after marveling over its charm and intricacies, one wonders what this movie is about beyond the director showing you stuff he thinks is cool.And though it is cool stuff, it's easy to get the feeling Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is smirking at us, overly proud of itself and its level of detail: there are countless movies within the movie, movie posters and marquees, quick cameos, name drops, fast food and junk food brand sightings - so much so, that 60s pop culture becomes a lead character.It sounds redundant but there are so many Quentin Tarantino things in this Quentin Tarantino movie that it can feel like a big inside joke. It's loaded with his familiar editing style; quick cuts to the past to fill in a character's back story; actors from his previous films who show up just to deliver a couple lines; voice-over narration; clips from apocryphal B movies; the foot fetish; a snoring fetish; hokey one-liners; converging storylines and inventive carnage.It's his most self-referential movie yet, though it isn't clear what the audience is supposed to do with all the Tarantino-lore and minutiae.My point: the rich detail, skillful cinematography, and subverted history in this 2 hour 41 minute tale, though impressive, are not the real reasons to watch. Tarantino's most important ingredient is his realistic characters and relationships in hyper-real situations. He gives us truly interesting people with clear wants and needs, something many summer releases forget to do.", "QT at his best": "Typical quirky QT movie that draws you in and the time flies. Cinematically brilliant with arty camera shots and framing that just give it texture.... lots of throwbacks and typical Tarantino fine detail with plenty of fantasy, indulgence and tongue in cheek scenes. The dialogue is as expected for a Tarantino film and a joy to watch. Dicaprio and Pitt are superb but it's also packed with stars... loved it", "A few good moments": "Good actors, but to be honest, 70% of the movie is just boring. Sorry to say.", "Beautiful, funny and quite Hollow.": "Ultimately QTs latest film provides a beautiful visual experience of late 60s Hollywood, with excellent performances by Brad and Leo. Their comedic chemistry is amazing and is a highlight of the film. The film is let down though by a meandering plot that fails to captivate. Many scenes feel almost like filler, with pacing that falls short of Tarantino's signature style. The climax of the film is lacklustre and leaves you wanting more. Overall an enjoyable film that leaves you feeling somewhat disappointed. 7/10.", "Another pearl of Tarantino": "I love it, I love Tarantino, and he's done another masterpiece again. It's not for everyone, but with so much content, convincing characters and, with a fabulous Brad Pitt and spectacular Di Caprio. Congratulations and thank you very much for this movie. Many may think this is not the typical Tarantino movie, but they are wrong. All the ingredients are there, and the violence, it only comes at the end, and, all the Tarantino Style.", "Fantastic crew": "It is a great movie and I love the acting of Brad Pitt which he deserves the academy award of the best support actor", "You will find everything but a story": "The movie really doesn't deserve all the hype and anticipation. The story takes you nowhere.Brad Pitt shines in the movie but Leo couldn't because in half of the movie, he shoots different movies.I also don't understand the reason of several long shooting scenes. These scenes have nothing to do with the movie.Overall, the movie sucks!!!!!!All the stars for Mr. Pitt and beautiful cinematography.", "7 Stars Respectfully": "The ending, once it got there, was introspective and creepy. I think the movie did not move well enough for me and so loss of stars there. I also sort of think this movie did better than it should have because of the star studded cast. But the concept was good and I believe I had a grasp on what the director was attempting to get across by the end of the movie. Interesting.", "Good Acting": "Good slowburn movie with good acting.If you are in to a fastpaced film DO NOT SEE THIS \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160", "Definitely must watch twice": "If you're not familiar with Hollywood history...I definitely think you need to watch this movie, read up on all the movie reference history and then watch it again to truly appreciate it. Otherwise you'll leave the theater disappointed and wondering what did you just spend 2.5 hrs of your life watching. And if you don't have time to rewatch a nearly 3 hour movie, at least read up on the movie history.", "Wow. Self indulgence to the highest degree": "Cinematography was brilliant\nStory line was all over the place.\nToo long, too messy and not really that good.", "Movie that will cause shared opinions": "I'm a huge Tarantino fan. However, I think this movie will cause shared opinions.\nThe first two hours of late 60s retro cinematography will not be everyones cup of tea. Although the acting is excellent and I was feeling entertained, I think it was a little too much and I was constantly waiting for that classic Tarantino to kick in.\nThe reason why this movie still deserves a good ranking, is the outstanding acting from Brad and Leo throughout the movie, and the last 45 min. were the action accelerates from one to one hundred in just a couple of minutes; classic Tarantino style, was epic.\nTarantino delivers again, and the movie applies to the typical Tarantino characteristics; lots of unexpected elements and an originally spin on the real event.\nI love how Tarantino always manage to turn the real event upside down in hos story telling, leaving the audience with the thought: Did that just happend? I would surely watch this movie again, if not only just to discover new details I didn't noticed the first time.", "If you were old enough to remember the Charles Manson muders... Otherwise maybe skip this one.": "Could have been edited down to 90 minutes with no loss.\nMost of the movie panders to the nostalgia of the late 60s. If you were not alive then, this will mean little to you.\nLots of style and atmosphere, but no real payoff.\nMixing fiction with history is pointless.", "Disappointing for his 9th movie...": "I don't need to reiterate or add to what other low scorers have said other than if he sticks to his 10 movie policy, then it's a shame that this is his ninth.", "worst I've ever seen": "Mindless, meatheaded, vacuous, bloated, scattered, gaseous. this is a shining paradigm of a movie that never should have been made. and it wasnt. Quentin -- and I'm a huge fan -- cobbled together a string of disparate scenes bereft of any purpose or entertainment content. each scene was juat awful. add them together and you have a taller mound of wasteful crap. Folks like Ebert bandy praise about in an effort to be hip to the story so imperceptible to us mere mortal, who had to swim through this endless preening so awash in stupidity and emptiness. I guess my secret decoder ring needs batteries. what I saw was an hour of Tarantino's time weaving jello together, then festooning it with his famous friends. want a true test of what you thought of this bubbling mess? imagine seeing it again with capable unknown actors. no Pitt, no Leo, no Douglas. you would have left in half an hour. stop kidding yourselves. and spare me that QT is making a ton. he doesn't need the $ so why prostitute his daunting talent and deliciously idiosyncratic prism. I picture his actor pals over a drink chuckling about how Tarantino has started dropping acid. one word -- he now owes me 2 hours of my life back.", "Ultimately, just empty, but maybe that's the point?": "Ok, so I don't go see Tarantino movies expecting flat out murder, brutality and gore from the outset, I know he has much more depth than that, and I think he has created some really great storylines in many of his films, most notably the Hateful 8, therefore I would have been happy for it to be what I expected from the trailers; a paean to Hollywood and some of the great characters it's produced throughout the ages, with a little Tarantino blood spatter thrown into the mix somewhere along the line, obviously. Unfortunately, what I got was a self indulgent, misshapen, unconnected, mess of a love letter to an industry which only comes across as disgustingly self absorbed, and empty. The mind blowing addition of some key Hollywood figures feels like it has no baring, or point, and leads absolutely nowhere.\nWith the exception of some absolutely fantastic acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, the trailer scene being one of the best I've seen for a long while, I left the cinema feeling extremely disappointed. Two words; industry narcissism. I can't believe the high scores, and I can't believe I've wasted another portion of my life writing about it.", "It was lame and boring.": "This movie has no drive. Nothing is keeping you glued to your seat. Nothing keeps you interested or immersed. It was lame and boring. I turned it off and started watching the sports channel. No one, not even Tarantino wastes my time. No spoilers because nothing happened.", "The worst film of 2019": "The worst film of 2019\ndon't watch\nVery boring\nNo story\nVery slow", "What an absolute disappointment": "Tarantino what has happened?.

Four might be too good but this wasn't all s***.\nYou can see from reviews that hipsters do like this (another's crap is another's gold). Most rated this from 1 to maybe 6, but then there were hipsters and 10's started flying. \"This was different..\" does not make it good, usually same line is used when you taste something awful and you can't say it or \"You didn't understood this...\" still s***, but I'm so different that I like this and everyone else also should.", "Complete waste of effort and time": "Tarantino's worst movie so far. I don't say ever because he might still make even worse movies until he retires, but this particular movie as I said is a complete waste of effort and time. I watched it at home with 3 friends, 2 of them fell asleep during the movie (it was 7pm)... Basically there is no real story line, no funny conversations like in other QT movies, no action except in the last 5 minutes and nothing really happens for nearly 2,5 hours. I only give it 3 stars because of the actors and the realistic 60' scenery, but HOLLYWOOD is dead!\nQT should be ashamed :(", "Overwhelming boring for the first two hours": "I have never been more tempted to walk out of a movie before. Literally nothing happened for the first two hours! There was no plot and it was mostly lots of fragmented scenes put together. Load of self indulgent crap! People did walk out the theatre. Huge waste of time and a disappointment as I am usually a great fan of Tarantino's work. I will say the acting and cinematography was good but that alone can't carry a film for nearly three hours. Needs more substance!", "Worst failure of Holywood in 2019": "Those were the worst spent 3 hours of my life! This movie is so boring it hurts, probably one of the worst screenplays in the history of Holywood. Only thing worse than this teadious all night feature are people pretending that they got the gist of it. There is nothing to get! If this movie hasn't be directed by Tarantino and if it didn't include such a briliant cast-none would watch, it wouldnt make it to cinemas! On the positive note-acting is top notch across the board but event that doesnt help much as movie has not plot what so ever", "the weak film": "I did not expect such a weak film. empty and meaningless. Tarantino lost", "One Hysterical Coming of Age Quelled Cinematic Panic Attack.": "Before I truly begin, I must admit, as much as I respect him for elevating cinema as a craft, I have always thought Tarantino's films to be rather tedious yet buoyant, padded out by occasional ultra-violence with sizeable precision and well devised ostentatious dialogue, this film, needless to say, is none of those things.It is Tarantino taking a gander at his predecessors with a brash glee, infused with just enough of the mans signature style to please the buffs. It is nostalgia of a different kind, a personal nostalgia, it does furtherer than cite a romanticised past. Not only does he elevate tropes and make the audience conscious of the difference between prior and present, he also adds another layer of true poignancy, because although he didn't well and sincerely experience 1969, he felt it, and he recognises its influences, upon him, and others, he knows the gut of the era, and you can really share that when you watch the film.But on a less malleable note, the film in general. Yes, it is full of Tarantino's generation cutting (although the structure remains conventional), the seductive talking, and his evocative visuals of pulpy times since past, it plays more like the cinematic embodiment of \"Everybody's Talkin'\" always on its toes, fast an choppy yet subdued, somber and peppy in a playful way. So my conclusion, It may not be his \"best\" film, but it is his masterpiece.", "I guess even Tarantino makes mistakes": "I have loved many Tarantino movies since the beginning...this is not one of them.The introduction to the characters and the planning of the \"action\" takes 2 hours. The movie passes the mid point, the last third and until the last half hour nothing happens. You don't even get the typical awesome Tarantino music (relying on California Dreaming version to avoid 100% of boredom rate).I couldn't care at all about the characters and at several points I couldn't understand the point of many of them. They were introduced and had very little or no impact on the plot.Photography and actors performance was the best part.I recommend you to go and watch another Tarantino movie instead of this one and save your time. You won't miss anything.", "simply magnificent": "As someone who has liked, disliked and loved some of Tarantino's previous work, and someone who's an avid consumer of quality cinema, I went in with some hype, some skepticism and mixed expectations. I had a slight idea what the movie was about, but I never bothered to dig deep into it before actually watching it. And since I believe I could've enjoyed it much more had I looked up the whole story prior, I highly recommend you do. It won't spoil the fun for you, it'll add up to it.So I sat there, doing my best to just enjoy the movie instead of being too critical of it and looking too far into the scenes than I probably should, which certainly made for a better, more relaxed experience. The movie is long, and it being somewhat slow paced and patience demanding (which we're not always used to from Tarantino) could make it feel even longer, but if you're into that like I am, you know that's where the fun is at.I smiled effortlessly at most of the scenes (because they were just THAT good) and even laughed with some of them, but one thing is sure, in classic Tarantino fashion, the writing and dialogue were absolutely ON POINT.The casting could not have been better, each actor portrayed their character to mere perfection and they felt more like actual people than in any other movie I've seen.Then comes the storyline, And I can't help but be a little biased here, seeing as my favorite movies are those that do nothing more than just tell you a story, the ones that make no effort to keep your attention. There's some events going on that you just have to follow, even if they feel like they're not leading to any peak or climax. This movie is a PRIME example of that. Perfect for people who like to get invested in a film rather than have it reward or gratify them.And then it ended, leaving me, and everyone there I'm sure, STUNNED by what we had just seen, by how brilliant it all was and wishing we could watch the whole thing over again, there and then. It was a truly surreal experience.", "When you are wondering where It is going then comes the ending.": "A great Tarantino film there are points in the movie when you are wondering where the story is but the shear vibe the movie gives off alone is so enchanting it leaves you stuck watching for more, the whole movie is just a day in the life of a Hollywood actor from the era. The ending is awesome hilarious and somewhat unexpected. Overall I loved the movie yet I don't know why. I guess it's just Tarantino magic.", "Mega crap": "I don't understand all the good reviews for this movie, it has to be the worst film I have ever seen.Loads of pointless scenes which seem to drag on forever. Good 10 mins at the end but sadly that is all", "Oh, but the build-up": "A daring nod to the best spaghetti western of all times - and the one with the slowest pace.\nDefinitely an enjoyable and very complex experience. Everything connects in a sloooow and steady pace focusing a lot more on character interaction and quirkiness than I'd usually expect. Lots of laughable moments. And the round-off - quite un-Tarantinoish. A bold move. Love it!", "The film is long, and COULD be boring. But still Great!": "Many people complain of a long film that consists of no script or plot. They claim it solely relies on the quality of its actors and cinematography. These people are actually just unaware of what it is they are watching. Tarantino's story's are all slow to pick up, but not if you know the proper information when you enter the story. It amazes me the amount of people who stupidly fail to connect that the story is based on the Charles Manson murders.. if you know this story even half way well, you are off to a good start. After that you just need to be a film lover. Nearly every scene from this film is a parody on the golden days of Hollywood. It's beautifully done, wildly unexpected, and quite funny if you pay attention to all the similes. An upbeat story about friendship and an idealized Hollywood. Though a dark ending, the story still resonates better than the actual Unfortunate events it is based on. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys old westerns, the history of Hollywood, or enjoys any type of nostalgia.", "Gripping Hollywood 69 nostalgia...": "From the very start I was captivated. The amazing weather, authentic back drops and superb acting, as well as an amazing soundtrack, brought 69 Hollywood alive. There is a mixture of tragedy and total joy from artificial paradises that make this film outstanding in my eyes. Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate so convincingly that her character becomes extremely likeable. She is like a little hedonistic child hungry for fame. The fact that the viewer knows what will happen to her makes her character even more poignant. Leonardo De Caprio is just stunning. An awful man and yet his self criticism is somehow very moving. Brad Pitt and his dog steal the show. Brad is confident, easy going but ultimately ruthless. His character is so complex and strangely likeable that the extreme violence he displays against the murderous hippies is accepted. It is as if the viewer knows that he is ultimately in charge. He knows everything. Nothing ruffles his feathers. I think he embodies the spirit of the film. He is charismatic, sexy, lethal, handsome and an enigma very much Iike Hollywood in 69. Worn at the edges but totally captivating. This is a great film. I could not even blink unless I missed something and the 3 hours flew past. It is a film you get or you don't. I adore it. It is a classic in my eyes.", "Dear fans of Taranitons.": "A boring movie that doesn't deserve the hype he received, People who like this movie and rate it 10 are tarantino's a$$ lovers,Bringing 3 of the best actors and the huge money spent on this movie is not enough to cover the failure of Tarantino and is bad movie.", "It Is Not Shawshank Redemption, But It Is Still Good": "Normally, I cannot stand over-long films. Rarely films have enough screenplay to justify going over 100 minutes. Rare films like Shawshank Redemption are exceptions of course.Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood actually did not bore me and kept my attention. I know, you will think its was the white short skirt and sight of slender legs, well yes but honestly I was curious about the lives of the main characters.. also great acting.", "If you're Quentin Tarantino you'll love this movie": "This movie is just about the obscure old Hollywood stuff Quentin Tarantino is all nerdy about.\nHe is not trying to make you appreciate those things like he does, he just nerds out about it and doesn't bring you into this stuff.\nThis movie is only made for Quentin Tarantino and maybe his close friends who are also old-movies nerds... pure garbage.\nAt least there is enough eye candy and action to make it somewhat bearable.", "Love Letter to Classic Cinema": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a very entertaining movie. It's slow pace might put some people off but I was never bored at any point during the movie.The acting was, as expected, great. Leo Di Caprio plays the washed up actor Rick Dalton very realistically as well as amusingly. Brad Pitt plays the no nonsense stunt double Clith Booth with ease, he really feels in control of situations. The chemistry of these two actors is just great. Margot Robbie doesn't say too much but what we do get of her portrayal of Sharon Tate is very tasteful and respectful, the film shows her as a kind, carefree young woman with a great career ahead of her.Some thought the story was a little aimless but I disagree. I enjoyed the journey of Rick Dalton, it was entertaining to watch. The friendship between Clith and Rick feels incredibly authentic, one of my favourite scenes was when the two of them were sitting watching TV.\nThe last 20 minutes or so were very Tarantino and very satisfying, I was having a blast. This film was a comedy and it easily succeeded at being one. Every joke had so much build up and the payoff was worth it, I was laughing out loud a lot which doesn't happen often for me.The set design is so immersive I felt like this really was filmed in the 60s. The ads, the billboards, the cinemas, the film posters and so much more bring this film to life. Tarantino clearly loved classic cinema and this movie feels like it was crafted with passion and care, which is something you don't see often.Overall, this was incredibly enjoyable. The acting was excellent, the story was entertaining and funny, it felt very immersive and the comedy was just fantastic. I recommend it.", "This is a disappointing long-winded tale about a has-been actor and stuntman.": "This is a disappointing long-winded tale about a has-been actor and stuntman.The set reproduction and (over restored) cars were interesting.

Many scenes were like that. I felt the movie would lead me to a bigger message to think about at the finale which I found way too simple.", "Quentin Tarantino Classic": "Great Acting, Great Plot Twist, Quentin Tarantino makes another good movie, kind of gets a little wild at the end but thats his movies for you.", "Minimal Plot; slow story": "I was quite disappointed with this movie. Great actors, but the storyline contains few laughs, minimal suspense, and just plods along for 2.5 hours until the final 20 minutes.Yes, the characters are interesting enough to follow along. You can't help but enjoy DiCaprio and Pitt going through their daily lives. But after a while you expect more.Spoiler alert...\nThe main thing going on as the movie goes along is DiCaprio's character (Rick Dalton) dealing with a Hollywood career that's fading out. This is tied into Tarantino's dream of how nice it would have been had the Charlie Manson cult followers not killed Sharon Tate and her guests, but were to have been killed by a neighbor. That's it. That's the plot. For some reason the viewer has to wade through a lot of scenes of Rick Dalton acting in a movie he's playing a role in, and preparing for the day's scenes. I was continually left wanting.", "A little flawed but still superb": "Visually beautiful, stunning. Sets and wardrobe are top-notch. Brad and Margot walk away with the film. Margot's role may be little more than an extended cameo, but she doesn't need many lines because her facial expressions say volumes; she could have been a silent movie star 100 years ago.It makes more sense if you know the backstory well. The Easter eggs are plentiful. I'll admit this movie made me depressed. Seeing Sharon show off her unborn son's nursery made me sad and angry at once. Why do horrible things happen to good people? I appreciated Q.T.'s revisionist history, but I never stopped feeling the dread of what really happened.", "ZERO STARS. What a waste of time and money": "How did this movie receive any awards?

The majority of this movie is filled with amazing cinematography, icredible dialouge and even better acting. This movie is one of my top twenty movie favorite movies(that bruce lee scene made it even better). The last 30 minutes of the movie is classic Tarintino. It is one of his best fight scenes.

Set in 1969 Los Angeles, the film follows the lives of fading TV star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), as they navigate through the changing landscape of the film industry and encounter a cast of colorful characters.One of the standout performances in the film comes from the young and talented Julia Butters, who plays Trudi Fraser, an eight-year-old actress who shares a scene with DiCaprio's character. Butters' portrayal is both captivating and endearing, as she holds her own against the seasoned DiCaprio, and delivers one of the most memorable lines in the film.Margot Robbie's performance as Sharon Tate, the real-life actress and victim of the Manson Family murders, is also worth noting. Despite having limited screen time, Robbie brings a warmth and innocence to the role that adds to the film's bittersweet tone.The film's soundtrack, which features a mix of popular songs from the era is a perfect complement to the film's nostalgic vibe. Jarre's haunting score in the final scenes of the film is particularly memorable, adding an emotional weight to the film's climax.Overall, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a beautifully crafted film that showcases Tarantino's mastery of storytelling and his love for cinema. The film's blend of humor, drama, and action, combined with strong performances from the cast, make it a must-see for any film lover.\"", "My favorite Tarantino-Movie": "Setting, Actors, Story ... everything superb about this movie.", "Not so Tarantino": "The plot is very engaging but for those expecting a classic Tarantino movie it's not the best fit. Except for the final scene, of course.", "A great journey.": "Now, I will not say that Quentin Tarantino is objectively the greatest director of our time, since that's not a thing we can call anyone, since it's a very subjective topic.But this movie solidified the fact that he is my favourite director of all time. I know his movies/characters aren't the deepest, but goddamn all of his movies are fun rides, and this movie is no exception. It's so fun watching Cliff and Rick interact with the world and people around them, and that ending. Ohhhh that ending, man. Pure fun.10/10, this movie was an amazing experience and, again, it solidified the fact that Tarantino is my favourite director.", "Too Unrealistic": "UnrealisticThere is a girl.

It's towards the end and I loved the movie besides it so it really bummed me out. I know Quentin Tarantino is violent but this scene is absolutely depraved and unnecessary. I appreciate the basic idea of it but it is so over the top I had to cover my eyes and ears. I wish that was done differently because the rest was truly great.", "Not Realistic": "There is a babe actress. She is into you or pretends to be and wants you to enter her.

Shots of LA in 69 include cars, buildings , iconic theaters and movie posters. I was only 2 years old in 69, but watching the movie it felt almost like living in the era. Great performances by all the cast. In particular I find it interesting to watch actors playing actors acting. I have watched it twice and the second time i enjoyed it just as much.", "It was good but I felt lost...": "Amazing movie I would have liked it more if I was able to pay attention but amazing movie Tarantino is always able to make a great movie practically effortless.", "Mediocre and forgettable movie": "Try to imagine that you are not an American, and you don't know anything about Charles Mason crimes. Then you will realize that the movie ending is not great, it is just ok.\nSo the 2 and a half hours of boredom are not a justification for 10 minutes in the end that are ok.\nThis film is very far from a masterpiece ! All 9 and 10 reviews are from paid people or from ones that tries to stay in line with Tarantino's hype.\nBut the king is naked, there is nothing great about this movie, you should simply admit that is at most a trivial one, way too long,\nwith some good actors that have not plot to play", "A wish ...": "This is a tale. This is a history as it might have turned out. Tarrantino placed events in his world, having grown up in SOCAL, in a fantasy using the world he knew as the backdrop for an alternate history of a tragic murder. While the grim details of that event do not find their way into the film, we see a somewhat innocent Sharon Tate sensing her bright future in the Hollywood culture somehow dodging the trappings of the twisted personalities formed around Charlie Manson, who thankfully has a very minor spotting in the film. The two major roles here carve out a story in Quintenesque style that satisfies especially well in my opinion as the man always does. That comes along near the end and ties it up handily. Having grown up in that world myself, I am always gratified to see the locales Mr. Tarantino uses in these stories that seem to serve him well.", "The Sum Of Its Parts": "Acting: 10/10 no exaggeration, could you imagine better acting?Story: 7/10 It does meander, but overall one is interested in who these people areSense Of humor: I am not the person who always needs something funny, but you have to hand it to Tarantino.

It's hard for me to reconcile the genius who made Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs with this movie. Maybe Tarantino needs such a tight budget that he's constrained to a narrow production lane and a well defined plot. But the flamethrower bit was awesome!", "Not too boring, but tame, until the end!": "Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt play Western TV star and his stunt double in 1969. It ostensibly is about these protagonists noticing how Hollywood has changed since they first started in showbiz. Many of their scenes were shot at the ghost town location where the Manson family is now living, apparently by then it was no longer being used by Hollywood. One day Brad Pitt picks up a female hitchhiker who is one of the hippies that lives in the ghost town hippie commune. Pitt drives her there and experiences what would creep out the average person, but Pitt's character handles it in style. (he even has an interesting encounter with Bruce Lee) This is a typical Quentin Tarantino movie, very quirky with a mix of drama and comedy. This movie is remarkably tame as far as violence goes, until the very end, which shows an alternative universe version of the Manson family violence. This movie is not for the faint of heart!", "Quentin- The Master Storyteller!": "I have watched this great movie many times. Seeing the main characters develop and liking them makes you care about what happens to them. This movie has such a talented cast. You laugh, you cheer, you rage and you're at the edge of your seat. The build up to that WOW ending is awesome- so worth waiting for! (Just spent two years battling cancer and movies are my beautiful escape! I'm indebted to everyone involved! Many thanks!)\nAs for the ending, I wish it was true. Men and women alike agree! It's what everyone wishes for! Touches my heart every time and the emotions it brings out is exactly what art should do! Bravo Quentin! Your homage filled my heart! Thank you!", "Boring... boring... Please maka a DC": "This movie should be re-cut into 1h long version.

Even the cast couldn't save this one. Sometimes, ideas should rest in the comfort of a notebook's pages.\nBeautiful photography though.", "No story. Very contrived. Weak dialogue. Last 20 minutes was good though.": "I was really liking forward to this film since I grew up in LA and I'm Tarantino's age. Film had great set design, but there was no real story other than the final 20 minutes. To get there you need to sit through 2 hours of contrived fluff strung together to showcase the cool set design of the era. The dialogue was weak. Throwing in the cute kid and the cute dog was simply lame. Having us sit through Leo as a failing drunk on the set of a Wanamaker film did nothing other than punish the viewer. This film was on the level of a high school or college mind with a big budget and crew. Thought it was an homage to LA when LA was cool and hip and happening. The Artist did a much better job of paying homage to the film industry as did Altman's The Player. ABC's The Fall Guy did a better job. This film sucked and did a weak job of capturing LA.", "Brief Review": "I was hooked on the characters and my curiosity continued around how Margot Robbies character would intertwine with Dicaprio's. Not the ending I expected but it was brilliant Tarantino style gore and brutal action. I burst into laughter on several occasions, and was touched by certain addiction struggles, self esteem issues and a couple of very special friendships which lived on right to the end. Bravo all involved.", "mediocre": "Absolute dross, wasted 2hrs of my life watching this rubbish, I went to watch this based on the review score of 8.0.\nAll I can surmise is that there are a lot of folk that are easily pleased writing reviews on this site", "Doesn't make much sense.": "Went by fast plot is pretty random but it was nice movie.", "A retro alternative ending - a terrific movie": "I am in awe of how the producers managed to get 1969 LA onto the screen. Di Caprio and Pitt are perfect in this movie that recreates the era with such authenticity, and weave events from that year into it... right up to the alternate history. Absolutely loved it.", "Classic \"What If\" that could be misunderstood": "I really enjoyed the performances of DiCaprio and Pitt, as usual. The movie was entertaining, especially if knowing a bit of history about the Manson Family, but see how viewers without that background could get lost in the plot, and not even get the point of the film, which was almost lost on me until the end. Humor and violence, what one expects with Tarantino.", "Tarantino outdoes himself again! And water is wet!": "JUST WATCH THIS MOVIE!It is kinda bloated although i can't take any action against tarantino. This may not be his best but is one helluva ride! SEXY AF!", "Divisive": "This film leaved me with very, very mixed feelings. The rendering of LA at the end of the 60s is visually stunning without appearing fake or forced. Cars, outfits, buildings, landscapes, everything feels real, on point and contributes to create a vibrant atmosphere. The acting is top notch, especially Brad Pitt.Now I have to be honest I did not understand a lot of key aspects as I was watching it and I believe the negative reviews are partly based on a misunderstanding (and maybe a certain lack of humility of some people...). Every scene is packed with references, symbols and deep meaning hidden under the surface. From the Margot Robbie scene in the movie Theater portraying the innocence of those days to the brutal, cathartic end fueled by the hate for the Manson family and the Sharon Tate murderers that destroyed this very innocence.The main characters are two sides of the same coin. Leo is a doubtful, half touching half insufferable person, borderline alcoholic, constantly seeking approval from others. The actor is first of all a man. Brad is incredibly calm, confident, full of secrets and resources. He s the unbreakable character in a movie from the 60s.So what could seem empty and boring is actually quite meaningful, everything stands for something and there s meaning in everything, however the average viewer that I am would have appreciated another layer of more basic scenario and more entertaining dialogues (as Tarantino got us used to).In the end this movie has outstanding redeeming qualities but it s paradoxically too personal to be considered a universal masterpiece. That s my humble opinion.", "One thing": "I love this film...BUT...I have always said damian Lewis is the spit of Steve McQueen but how did they manage to make him look nothing like him? Apart from that and the vague worry that people will watch this and not realise Quentin was finishing the story the way he thinks it should have gone...it's just superb.", "Boring and Dull": "I love LC, BP and Tarantino but this movie is not sufficient interms of portraying these actors skills. The plot is weak and even though the director choose some long shots, typical old Hollywood Style movie editing and camera work - the net result is this movie is 2019 disaster.", "What's the point? I kept waiting and waiting.": "This movies tried to make you feel for horrible pieces of crap. Every character is sleazy and egotistical. I really don't understand why someone would praise this film like people have. It's literally just a 60s simulator. Really boring.", "Waited till June 2020 to watch this...and it's the most promising film to have come out in 2019! Not Tarantino's top 5 though": "Arguably, this is not even top 5 out of Tarantino's 9 films for his fans (audiences saying Tarantino's most overrated, overhyped film ever). However, after watching this latest masterpiece, OUTIH has officially replaced my childhood Tarantino classic (fyi, kids weren't supposed to watch this) Kill Bill on my own top 5 of Tarantino's films!Judging from all the promotions & trailers, I thought to myself this is a very different Tarantino movie as there doesn't seem to be any Tarantino gore violence being seen around here. And that is alright because I didn't mind that since this is just a comedy-drama and I was happy to see Tarantino trying to move away from his usual violent style after Django Unchained & The Hateful Eight.Why people don't like this movie is because it's not like a usual Tarantino's other film due to the lack of his regular violent style as mentioned earlier. What they don't understand is that this is Tarantino's comedic & thoughtful tribute to the late 60s Hollywood that some of us younger audience may have never seen and experienced before. I started appreciating the pop culture back in those days and for some unknown reason, Leonardo DiCaprio singing & dancing to Jim Lowe's \"Green Door\" song just keeps popping up in my brain cells for the past month, lol!One of the most interesting films of 2019, this is probably the first Tarantino film that I think boys and girls can enjoy. Characters that are either fictional or non-fictional such as Sharon Tate, the Manson family (a bunch of weirdos) and even BRUCE LEE (although it's an addition people are unhappy with)! This just makes Tarantino's screenplay more engaging & entertaining at the same time because by the end of it, you'll recognise that he wants his viewers to immerse into his alternate vision of the 60s Hollywood...just like what he does with his other films.The first 15 minutes compromises of the introduction of the character before we start off exploring 3 different storylines; Leo's character Rick Dalton's tarnished acting spell, Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth on his trip to an old film company patrolled by some hippie cult and Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate (real-life Hollywood star in the 60's), which might be a pointless, short segment to look at but it fits into the historical context of the time this film was set in and she also happens to be Rick's neighbour.After going through the first 2 hours, everything comes together in the last 45 minutes of the film! Unexpectedly, the most surprising last 45 minutes you'll ever see in movies! Irritating, intense but a lot of fun at the same time. I'm sure based on the fact that Sharon Tate is a non-fictional character, you would definitely want to do some research afterwards because I have found some stuff that has broken my heart and furious at the same time.Tasteful & natural chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio & Brad Pitt, I was so excited to see two of my favourite film superstars on-screen together! That's the feeling I'll get if I get to meet Cristiano Ronaldo for the first time EVER! Leo's performance as Rick was funny, charming and quirky but it's about Brad Pitt's coolness & charisma that stole the show, even as a supporting actor. As soon as Brad won an Oscar for this film, I had doubts whether he deserved it or not but whenever Brad is in a Tarantino film, it's just pure satisfaction. Also, his character Cliff Booth was certainly the most interesting to watch but that's up to you to decide.After seeing this film, I have high expectations for the Korean masterpiece Parasite (still haven't watched it yet ) as they did beat other films in 2019 such as Joker, 1917 or Ford vs Ferrari for Oscars Best Picture! OUTIH is A MUST WATCH, even if you're not a Tarantino fan!", "I have never bothered to review a film but I'm doing you a favour": "This was one of the worse films I've ever seen. The fact it wasted two and a half hours of my life and filled you with false hope over big stars and an exciting trailer. Literally everything that happens in the film is in the trailer, so saves yourself a lot of time and just watch the 3 minutes. Anything outside that was drunk Leonardo DiCaprio shouting at himself alone in a room. Or close ups of Margot Robbie's face doing meaningless tasks. I mean I know she can't actually act and is cast for one reason, but come on. Everyone giving it good reviews like a bunch of sheep because it's Quentin Tarantino. Get a grip, doesn't matter how big the names, it was nonsense. None of it made much sense, nothing came together till the last 10 minutes and then you were left thinking why though? What actually happened? What was the point?\nWhy was there at least 10 minutes of a film dedicated to watching Margot Robbie watch a film. I honestly can't explain what a pathetic attempt at a film this was. Highly recommended The Gentlemen though", "Light duty, little action, kinda of a letdown.": "We were hoping for more, but it never came...a little disappointing on all scores. Leo was great, Brad was interesting, Robbie could have played more. The ending, however, is the way it really should have been from back in the day. RIP", "Wasted a lot for that nothing! yes it is nothing!": "I literally wasted 10$ of my money, 2 hours of my life and 400kcal because of the crap I had to eat during this nothing! I really cant call it a movie, I just cant!", "SO GOOD": "SO GOOD. Love Leo so much & loved the happier ending to the Manson story!", "Tarantino impressively spreads absolutely nothing over 160 minutes": "The performances were great and it was well shot, but nothing happened. The only only character development happened over the course of a minute and was somewhat irrelevant. If you watch the first and last 30 minutes this is probably excellent.", "What's it for?": "Huh? Why make a movie like this? What's the purpose?", "An acquired taste...": "It is an interesting film for people who love the complex story lines and the acting is great and as you would expect from an all-star cast. However, its like being at work and watching a health and safety video - watching it makes sense but jeeez it will suck the life out of you!", "Technical Perfection...but boring overall": "Let me say with the good things about this movie. Leonardo and Brad give a beautiful performance for the movie, one of their best. The direction and cinematography, is also quite unique and brilliant, something you would expect In a tarnatino film. Furthermore, there are some scenes in the movie that brings you to the edge of your seat or make you laugh like crazy.The bad? despite all it's technical perfection, the overall movie fails to satisfy. The story of the movie is not something to applaud. At times you feel lost and try to figure out where is this going and is quite boring. Furthermore, Its not like I don't love drama, but I expected more action or suspense knowing that this a Tarantino movie. If I compare this with his other classics like kill bill, pulp fiction etc. this would not rank among the top. The strength of every drama is a good story, and that is what I feel lacked here.At the end of the movie, I left the theater impressed by individual performances of the actors and movie team, but unfulfilled overall due to a weak story, which was a huge let down as I expected a lot from this movie.", "Disappointing!!": "OMG, slow story, no point. This isn't an Oliver Stone JFK assassination conspriracy theory compilation-like story of Charles Manson and his hippies killing the innocent people at the party with Sharon Tate. This is an alternate, dull, made-up story peripheral to the Sharon Tate story: a what-if story full of who-cares fictional characters.", "sounds like my treatment conspiracy town": "I was gang goosed by the staff until I submittedthen Quinten kissed me.While im rambkubg, I did send tarentinos agent a treatment called\"hit squad\"about a group of cops who were assassinated by a hit squad, keeping on the legend by one.", "It's official, old buddy, I'm a has-been.\" said the director tenderly": "Before I bash the motion picture in question,I'll have to admit I do quite like the lighting and the atmosphere for it reminds me of Grase, France. They don't need to be rectified.The casting for this film is absolutely atrocious and preposterous because leonardo Dicaprio (fyi not a avid fanatic ) is playing Fictitious character named Rick Dalton who is ignorant,ruthlus and reluctant in how he wants to be prevalent. Brad pitt's characters only ever looks appesed, that mutated ser-wars that is played by al paccino is just full of mallace. Margot Robbie there is very little resemblance to Shannon Tate. As for Michael madson, kirt russel and bruce dern, It's absolutely amazing to see them (in particular Bruce) but It means absolutely nothing when compared to the monumental problems like: the soundtrack is over saturated to the point of being outdated and garish. Why is there no reggae or scoring?I wish the film was more all about the state that Hollywood became during the 2000s. You know. Type casting,over usage of CGI and films being made not for artistic expression, but to skyrocket ticket sales because I can understand why one would scorn it.(Despite it not being an action film)there are two fight scenes. One of them is set up to a joke however it is rather abrupt and unsatisfying and the last one Feels a bit out of place because of how it is barbaric and means nothing to the plot because the rest of the film Hasn't had a scene of such grotesque manners until the end. If your going to have the 2nd coming of STUNTman mike that resembles Mickey O'Neil,than please let have him have more STUNTS.They could have done a death proof/planet terror type of reel deterioration because that would be consistent with said films in how death proof was also criticising and referring to the aquept state of Hollywood and why did he make this feature longer than Gladiator?. Like i comprehend that its about being purposefully arduous but that still doesn't make it any more tolerable.By and large, if you want a feature that is gradual, than view the bridges of Madison county. It has a reason. I will like you for it.", "i don't like criminal movies": "But that is a teye story and I can't understand , that was written in Monte Carlo programme , is a Comedy, for me never\nThey wrote a big mistake\nAnd for you?", "Regret spending $5.99 rental!!": "Love, love, anything Quentin Tarantino. I meant to see it when it came out, then forgot about it, finally appeared on new releases to rent on tv. I can only say-what the hell? It's like the worse movie I've ever seen! Slow, slow, kept waiting for the pace to pick up, the music was constant and distracting, I fast forwarded a little then fast forwarded a little more. It was sooo long!! Ended up fast forwarding through 85%-90% of the movie! Thank God I didn't spend money seeing it at a theater! But I may check out some of the last 45 minutes while I have 48 hr rental since I'm seeing a few good comments about that.", "Drivel.": "Probably one of the most boringly narcissistic attempts at 'entertainment' I've ever seen. Dull as ditch water and the addition of Pitt and Di Caprio does nothing to rescue it. Clumsy script and predictably 'arty' in an attempt to be sophisticated. Crap!", "How a movie should be made?": "What I really love about Tarantino is how he made this movie with no real subject or goal, and yet, make it engaging close to three hours. It is remarkable how he fits the simplest of things you normally into a movie with such good continuity and humour. I love the style of his movies.The one thing that may have stretched is the Polanski bit but that is his style on how he weaves parallel stories together. Tarantino is a true artist who really knows how to paint movies.", "Tarantula": "Usually love his films, top cast, top director, shockin storyline with a bite of tarantula at the end. Really disappointed tbh, and glad I didn't go to cinema to fall asleep to it. He will be back better I'm sure", "Tarantino's best in years": "As a fan of Trantino-s work sonce Reservoir Dogs I had become a little tired of his over inflated, dialogie heavy and often pretentious offerings of late. All well written and wellmactwd of course, but lacking the cutting edge madness and comic genius of his earlier efforts.Once Upon a Time... Harks back to Pulp Fiction and Dogs with it's larger than life characters and comic book ser pieces.The story is follows Leonardo DiCaprio's ageing actor, an insecure failing former TV legend who is living off past glories, and his best friend for hire, Brad Pitt. The characters are well thought out, well written and extremely well acted. Their individual flaws are on display and that makes them all the more relatable.DiCaprio is the glue that holds it all together while Pitt is hilariously understated in his performance. But we also het treated to a delightful showing from Margot Robbie who, as Sharon Tate, is a joy to watch. Tate is like this shining light of positivity who just kind of floats through the film alongside the main story afilmIt is almost like she is the spirit animal of this film and Tarantino wrote a fitting, if somewhat stylised, tribute to the tragic actress. It's like a personal love letter to Tate.The story is well paced and, unlike most of Tarantino's scripts linear in nature, with none of his trademark time jumps. In true Tarantino eachnscene is a slow build with a payoff that makes each scene worth the weight. From Pitt's encounter with the Manson family to DiCaprio's cowboy actor having a moment of redemption on set, to the ultra violent but hilarious finale this film is Tarantino 101.Also, in true Tarantino fashion we get an alternative outcome to historical events and a rare happy ending.I suspect that on further viewings more nuances and subtleties will be revealed and the self-aware nature of the film, with it's obvious commentary about film makers coming to the end of their careers almost being a critique of Tarantino'a own career.", "I don't even know what this was": "The entire film is just too long and disjointed. It still has the same tarantino style ending. I really emjoyed the last 15 minutes but it just feels like i could've just watched first and last 15 minutes and enjoyed it just the same rather than waiting for 3 hours.", "A cinematic masterpiece": "A cinematic masterpiece. From the automobiles, the soundtrack, the wardrobe, everything was top notch. I particularly don't care for DiCaprio or Pitt, but both actors delivered top notch performances. If you're familiar with August 1969 Hollywood hills you will really appreciate this movie. The last 40 minutes are just icing on a beautifully made cake.", "Simply tremendous!": "Another phenomenal film from the crackerjack of modern cinema himself, Mr. Quentin. Reminiscent of your most partial cup of tea. What a delightful piece of pie. Unapologetically, Tarantino.", "Most accomplished Tarantino movie": "Of course it's not for everyone. Dialogues are long and \"meaningless\", action takes time to kick in. And that is what you should want to expect! All scenes are perfectly built, acting is great and well measured. And of course Pitt and Dicaprio are acting amazingly. They ting a way to act like the amazing actors we know without exaggerating or trying to pull the blanket. It's a very good movie with lots of subtleties and if you like cinema it's a must see.", "DISAPPOINTMENT !!!": "Except the last scene which was amazing and exited and the performance of BRAD PITT and some scenes of LEO . It's not the movie we waited for it could be better than that with these two actors and MARGO which had few scenes.", "Fun but a mess.": "I really liked the movie in the first and second act, but I thought it was a mess in the third act. Really good camerawork and with the special shooting of the camera's.", "Good Flick": "Margot Robbie is a modern day Grace Kelly. Beautiful and classy", "3h runtime not well deserved for the average viewer": "When there is substance to this film, it really shines, however, you will find that a vast majority of the film is comprised of gratuitous shots of driving cars in the 70s. It feels as though Tarantino goes for an art-film almost, which, like I said, is not too friendly of a watch for a casual, average viewer. The ending and acting scenes are written incredibly well, but like I said, this film lacks substance at times, and likes to pander to notalgia. Arguably an art film, this is NOT for everyone. Watch only if you are an extreme film buff or a film studies major.", "Brilliant mostly but boring in parts": "Have to say there are some of the best scenes going in this movie. Great acting all round and loved the nostalgia. Some scenes were long and unnecessary but in the main very very good. The last 20 minutes were brilliant. Great soundtrack and all in all I was impressed. Not a film for everyone hence the mixed reviews and definitely not for the squeamish (but Tarantino films are like that)", "Overrated and Boring.": "Just watch the last 30-45mins. Theres no need for such a lengthy movie when the only good scene is near the end.", "Breath of fresh air, Worth watching": "I am sick and tired of franchise, reboot, and remakes. This movie paid homage to Hollywood nostalgia and the infamous mass murder by crazed fanatics. A story about a struggling fading actor and his stunt double friend, their next door neighbour who happened to be part of Hollywood elites and some crazed fanatics. The story doesn't fall into a traditional arc, instead it started flat as you are getting to know the characters. Past the middle of the movie, tension began to rise involving with the Manson family and the story will concludes into a bloody end! The acting is superb, DiCaprio and Pitt's best performance. Robbie did a great job as Sharon Tate, her potential should not be wasted on run of a mill comic book franchise. Cinematography, soundtrack and overall execution is great. Supporting cast did an amazing job, many of them are Quentin Tarantino's Alumni.", "Many will not love this": "On the other hand I thought it was tremendous. I grew up during that era, and loved the nostalgia that filled this film. The acting was brilliant, the story in my opinion was just so cool. It was definitely Tarantino making his own fairy tale about television, film, and the famous.\nS\nSpoilers ahead!!!\nAs for the ending.\nTarantino wrote his wishful version of history. His hero had a chance to save the girl and perhaps be relevant again.\nI loved it and wish it could have been trueAfter all it is fairytale.\nAnd a lovely one at that", "2 hours of 20/20 followed by 20 minutes of plot/funny movie": "They clearly wrote Leo's role for Danny McBride, expecting Leo would turn it down. Get ready for 2 hours and 39 minutes of Leo doing his best, terrible impression, of Danny McBride.How much better the movie would have been, with DM, as well.The last 20 - 30 minutes are pretty dang refreshing, as you expect terribleness but wind up laughing your ass off, while secretly wishing the comedy wasn't muted by incapable comedic performers.Pitt was amazing though. Entire script, 6/10 at best. Snoozer.", "Good movie but...": "The way Bruce Lee was portrayed was REALLY bad. I'm really disappointed that Tarantino chose to do that.The rest of the movie is really good though.", "Fantastic.": "Heard mixed reviews about this film. Glad I decided to watch it. Everything about the film is fantastic, from the Acting to the directing. Well worth a watch.", "Irresponsible and Boring": "The first 3 Acts are simply an introduction to the last which drags on. Characters are not complex in any sort and I find it hard to find any meaning behind it compared to much of Tarentino's other works. Also it is wildly irresponsible with its blaz\u00c3\u00a9 attitude towards violence towards women, racial stereotyping and depicting the manson family hippies when they were murdering anarchists", "Rides on a gimic doesn't hold up on second viewing": "The film making is top notch as ever from Tarantino. But unfortunately his choice to go with a wacky ending effectively makes a lot of the film narratively redundant. I thought 90% of the film was building up these characters, some real and some fictional, to make you empathise with them to then have them horribley murdered to show how they were innocent and unlucky. But what we have instead is long scenes with long shots of Margot Robbie's feet, for no reason as she is effectively a pointless character.The saving grace of the film is that its an interesting look at friendship between Chad Pitt and Leo", "GammaBoiz Review Of \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\"": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a 2019 action-drama film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. This 9th movie of Quinten Tarantino had everything: a big star cast, a huge budget. The pace of the movie was so frustrating which made it dull and almost infuriating to watch, but since this was not my first Quinten Tarantino movie and I had watched Hateful Eight so I went on with the movie. The story of the movie is about the death of Sharon Tate but with the classic Quinten Tarantino twist like the one from Inglorious Basterds. The movie has many highlights like the Acting of Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt, ending of the movie just to name a few. But, the overall slowness and the drag this movie was in the first half was not able to propel it past an above-average rating of 7.5 out of 10. This is in no sense a bad movie but a shadow of what we have recently come to expect of a Tarantino movie.", "Slow and not for everyone": "I loved this movie, with a second viewing i enjoyed even more the movie because i was already aware of what will i see", "If I could give it a 6.5 I would...": "I'm going to do what I can to elaborate without spoilers.The cast was great, the dialogue was great, but there was\na void throughout. I felt that the extended character development was a little misguided. There were several unanswered questions why popped up and were given no explanation or closure.\nHe made a \"good\" movie and you can't take anything away from his originality but in my opinion this movie needed a spark that wasn't there. He gave his own twist on a historical event but it felt less than brilliant.\nThere were several -isms that drew comparisons to his previous movies but they had something this one didn't. If Tarantino retired after this I don't think I would blame him. After all creativity and originality and Hollywood are starting to be the opposite of synonymous given how many remakes and sequels are coming out. Improve on the old is the trend and I don't feel there is enough creative competition to result in another theatrical masterpiece.", "Complete trash": "First review, complete waste of time. Like other Tarintino movies.", "Slow but good": "No spoilers. Well made as you'd expect. Took way too long to paint the story. Ending was awesome. Ending bumped this from a 6 to a 7.", "A Few Words by Me on Once Upon A Time...in Hollywood": "When I first moved to Hollywood in October 2009, I made some friends who happened to know Quentin Tarantino. I remember the first place I met him was standing outside of The Silent Movie Theater on Fairfax. He stood quietly amongst his group and acknowledged my friends and I. He was one of those people who at first glance, you knew exactly who he was. Having been a long time admirer of his work, it was surreal to be in the presence of the man responsible for the wildly eccentric and artistic films of which the VHS copies had lined the shelves of my home movie collection growing up. Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Sin City, Grind House, Death Proof, and at that time, the recently released Inglorious Basterds.Naturally, I followed his work over the years, and was always excited when a new project was released.When I heard that Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood was in production, I think it goes without saying, that I was ecstatic. I mean, counting down the days until its release on my calendar ecstatic. Leonardo DiCaprio has been my favorite actor since Titanic, Brad Pitt, another long time favorite since A River Runs Through It, and Margot Robbie, a favorite since I first saw her in the short lived television series, Pan Am.As predicted, Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood did not disappoint.Every aspect of this film was art in the greatest sense of the word.I loved that although the plot takes place in the months and days leading up to the infamous Manson Murders of Sharon Tate, the focus remained largely on DiCaprio and Pitt's fictional characters. I appreciated that Manson was only mentioned several times and had zero screen time.I loved how it portrayed Sharon Tate as innocent, bubbly and happy. There's a scene in the Fox Theater in Westwood Village where Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), watches the real Tate on screen, and it was nothing short of endearing. It almost brought tears to my eyes to see her so happy and cheerful, as she looked around smiling at the audiences reactions to her acting on screen, and then to think of how her true story came to a tragic end in the non-Tarantino reality of her life.Every character drew you in, and made you feel for them. Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), with his worries of a fading career, and extreme highs and lows, Cliff Booth (Pitt), with his chill, laid back lifestyle and attitude, and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), with her innocence and girl next door persona; all of which made these characters lovable and somehow, relatable. The acting, on every front, was impeccably executed.Having lived in and amongst the canyons and freeways of Hollywood for the past 10 years, it was fascinating to see a 1969 version of the city so beautifully brought to life on the big screen. The costumes, the lighting, the props, the old cars; all perfectly working as one.The third act brought me so much joy. I loved how Tarantino rewrote history and flipped the script, completely surprising the audience. It made me wish that this was how the night of August 8th, 1969 had really played out. The classic Tarantino comedic violence was epic, and Pitt and DiCaprio's characters were hilarious. The writing, seamless.From top to bottom, every frame of this film was a true masterpiece.I have never seen a film that better dealt (loosely) with the subject of a real life horrific event, and managed to do so with the utmost respect. I don't think there will ever be another film quite like this one again.Thank you, Quentin Tarantino, for continuously making art that transcends. I patiently await your 10th (and final?) film, and maybe one day I'll see you again, once upon a time...in Hollywood.", "Love QT But can't find much to like in this one": "Sorry QT , I love almost everything you do, but this time, it wasn't for me. Its like you're stuck at the beginning of the movie for 2 hours, then you get a small , small middle part with no ending...", "Quentin Tarantino never dose wrong": "Great film it's got it all... if u like Tarantino moves this will be right up your street", "A pretty average movie in fact": "As expected from Tarantino, there is something new in this movie. Many fail to identify the plot of this movie and this is because the sole purpose of this movie is too depict the atmosphere and the rise and fall of Rick Dalton ( as an actor). Although, Tarantino initially wanted to characterize the unusual relation between an actor and his stuntman ( as shown in the movie and said in numerous interviews). For me the movie lacked finesse. It was shown in a very raw and slightly dark manner. It was not as refined as a movie of this sort should be. However; we can clearly see how personal this movie is to him as its also shows the time period when he started to like movies. DiCaprio did a good job in the acting section while Brad Pitt was not up to par. A decent performance by margot robbie and overall, a good film.", "Erasing Manson.": "This is virtual reality without the VR headset. I walked out of the theater to use the men's room (long movie & big drink) and the movie was with me. If I had seen 1960's automobiles outside thru the windows, it wouldn't have surprised me. It's that immersive.It's sunny, it's California and it's a dreamscape of Hollywood, the lack of traffic on the freeways is enough to title the film \"Once Upon a Time.\" but for the cloud of history that hangs over the film and how big that cloud is dependent on your knowledge of the events that transpired in February, but at the same time this movie takes manson the person, and his followers and erases them with the help of man's best friend, a blow torch and a well placed can of dog chow, poof no more, and for that reason alone I could give it an Oscar.All this told thru the eye's of a actor struggling to stay relevant in his business. While having stunt double who happens to be his best friend. They both have baggage that would rival DiCaprio's new wife's luggage in the airport scene. Even if you didn't have the rest of what is going on just telling their story alone would have been a good movie.Now we get on to Sharon Tate. She, enjoying her movie and dancing and just being who she was, enjoying life with her friends, because what happened to her in real life doesn't really need to be repeated.I guess that's the real reason you had to use the title \"Once Upon a Time\" is because this is the ultimate wish fulfillment. Bringing someone back that you love and seeing them whole and happy. What better use of celluloid magic.", "It won't be for everyone.....": "Really strange film, people say it never gets going however I always felt engaged in the film even though very little seemed to be happening, I think you would really need to understand the main characters to appreciate the film which I personally did, some characters did not really have a place in the story line In my opinion and like I've said this film will not be for everyone, that's why I'm giving it a 7.", "Not a single story.": "This movie is like a mixture of more than one story. If you are bored of superhero, romantic and action, go for it.", "Not the best, but not the worst": "I think it's not a brilliant film, but it is not the worst. For me, it was a bit boring, and I waited for some 'activity' but it not came. I know, it isn't an action movie, where all the people die, but I think this film isn't as good, as the critics say. We are not the same, and I don't like movies like this, but it isn't that bad, and isn't that good.", "It's worth a watch": "The movie was extremely entertaining.Especially the ending that reminded us of the kind of movie we were all watching.I would recommend it on the basis that it has all the touches of the director of Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino.Meaning the film is funny and insane in all the best ways.The last 10-20 minutes are when the satisfying destruction of a Quentin Tarantino movie finally shows up.", "Bruce Lee": "Very disappointed and angry about he uglifies Bruce Lee\u00f0\u0178\u2018\u017d\u00f0\u0178\u2018\u017d", "As a Tarantino lover I didn't like it.": "Film making is great, actors are fine but after 2hours of Brad Pitt driving his Cadillac around with no real point I got really bored. Had to look at my phone to know how long I still had to wait for something to happen.Spoiler alert: 5 minute of Tarantino violence at the end, and that's it.", "Dead movie apart from last 10 mins": "If you really want to watch this forward it to the last 10 mins", "Enjoyed !!": "Great acting and a great final scene. I also thought the production design and set decoration were fantastic. It was a bit long and slow in parts, though.", "Plotless Tarantino Movie but great acting!": "Not the best Tarantino film. Very slow beginning. Let's say the first two hours. The cast did amazing acting jobs considering there wasn't much of a plot. The time period was captured well. Best parts were the last 40 minutes of the film. Reminded me of true Tarantino style from that point onward.", "Tarantino Is The Man": "I do understand the criticism and how people felt bored, but for me this was a period piece and certainly amusing to watch. I felt they recreated the 70s really well.\nWith that said, my bias for this film is the same as Pulp Fiction. The on screen appearance of thin flaunting babe definitely helps me enjoy.", "Good movie with awesome ending": "It's a Quentin Tarantino movie...\nand it's not a biography..\ngood performance by the actors and actresses\nspecially by leo\ngood story and very good directing", "10 and I can't express it more": "simple all ya if u get it u do if u don't don't ever speak of the film....

This is a must watch.", "My favorite movie ever": "There is no movie other than Harry Potter I've watched as many times as I watched OUATIH BRAD PITT?? MARGOT ROBBIE? LEONARDO DICAPRIO??? AL PACHINO??? MARGARET QUALLEY?? With very small role but still -SYDNEY SWEENEY?? THIS IS CINEMA! Full of my favorite actors and my all time favorite director QUENTIN TARANTINO. PERFECTION.", "I Fast-forwarded every scene as it was so atrocious and utter trash": "This 2019 movie (ie) so called Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is basically for the trash movie audioence community with the lowest iQ -subsquentley its intellectecually minus zero--Mr B Pitt and Mr L Di Caprio weill be in no doubt deeply ashamed of this movie and - thats an understatement trust me- as its completely off the richter scale. For excruiating verval content --plus amatuerish & ultra garish visual scenes --Tarrintino is an unashamed trash orientated director-for the mentally unstable fraternity -so I should have known better to give it the time of day in the first place -but through our invalueable modern technology -and it giving one the ultimate privilige - hence the power for fast forwardinig recorded content --it just meant approx 37 seconds of my life wasted --and that was excruictating enough.-consequentley even that brief cacophony of content left me with movie viewers dreaded traumatizational-PST syndrome-which.will no doubt take time to recover from let say 10 mins at the most which I will scold myself for not having the good sense to have given itthis so called movie a miss in the first place-- consequentley one star only from me as you can not give a lesser score ---", "He must really hate hippies": "The whole movie has no plot and no apparent meaning. I do love Brad Pitt and Leo but that was ridiculous. I didn't expect much from Tarantino since I don't like his movies in general. The whole thing felt like a hippie revenge for no reason. He must really hate them. I don't see other explanation for this strange movie. The final scene that Leo burns the hippie girl was gross and absurd. It felt sick rather than anything else. QT'd ridiculous blood baths...\nI am giving it 5 stars because of the cool Hollywood references and the 2 leading actors.", "A whole lot of heart and a maturing of character": "Firstly, what I love about this film is what a lot of people gripe about - it takes its time, and it transports you into the world. This is not for people who need their attention grabbed with plot developments every 60 seconds. Secondly, the writing is beautiful - Tarantino isn't writing zingers, he just delivers an excellent story through dialogue and picture that isn't trying to be flashy...the whole piece feels beautifully made, rather than depending on set pieces or one-liners. Finally, it has a whole lot of heart - the ending is lovely, and feels completely at home in the Hollywood world of make-believe and idealism. It feels like one of Tarantino's most mature films, and it's the first time I actually wanted to sit down and watch a film again straight away for a second time. I never thought I'd say this, but I think it's my favourite of his along with Pulp Fiction. Cinema is going to be all the poorer when Tarantino isn't making film anymore.", "Wth did I just watch?": "The walkaway feeling after watching this movie is one of bewilderment. I hope that is what they were going for cause they nailed it. Filled with more twists turns and often irrelevant detours than Snake river one thing you can say for sure is you never know what you're gonna get next. Much to it's credit if the movie was based solely on competency of filmmaking then it would score highly. Every scene is well shot and timing is done well. That's the start and end of the praise for the most part though as it's more like nearly 3 hours of skit shows that just happen to feature the same core cast in many scenes.\nThe hot takes on hollywood through the lens of an aging actor play like Bojack Horseman but without the humour, and with much less depth. Yes people that worry about becoming has-beens will tend to be insecure, we get it. The movie loosely touches on the counter culture that sprung up in protest to the Vietnam war but the \"hippies\" are all just a right wing caricature of what they think hippies are, rather than based it real life. People that advocate for peace generally aren't prone to violence. Almost as a saving grace what little violence in the movie is so over the top that one can easily ignore it as comical, with one scene which is just brutal.\nAt the end of the day though the move has said nothing, we as an audience has learnt nothing, and all the people are bad. There is no one at the end to support and as I said at the start, what was this even all about? If I lived in a trailer park and had hard opinions on them libtards I might have enjoyed the ending a bit more, but as it stands - bewilderment.", "good to be Tarantino": "Good thing when you are Tarantino is that you can have world class actors in the room, turn camera on and go have a cofee for a while, the movie is mediocre, i enjoyed a lot in a few episodes. cant say its great, BP and LdC made the movie, if you remove them - no movie left.", "3 hours I will never get back": "That was the worst movie I have ever watch. Not even Margot Robbie made it interesting. I might never watch a movie again....", "Difficult to absorb.": "It's long but beautiful. Tarantino is the best director certainly of the last 25 years.\nHowever... We're still left with an overlong and let's face it, mostly dull movie. It's been troubling me why I don't like it and I finally worked out why - it's the whole Sharon Tate arc of the plot. If you removed EVERYTHING to do with her arc, we're left with an almost genius movie. Don't get me wrong, I think Margot Robbie is excellent, but if we'd just heard her voice right at the end... that would have been a perfect ending. And not to mention half an hour shorter.", "Being old enough to remember some events from that time helped.": "I would have rated it higher if it had been shorter. The title implies that it's a fantasy. I had only seen trailers and as I heard some of the names, I was thinking that I knew where it was headed (being a Tarantino movie). I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the imagining of what should have happened that night.The period signs, cars, jets etc were fantastic.", "frustration": "One of the most unnecessary films I've ever seen in my life is disappointment.", "I have no idea why people don't like this?": "This film is amazing, especially if you're a Hollywood history enthusiast like myself. I also LOVED the ending, almost a 'what should have happened' lets re write Sharon's story vibe, made me emotional. Nice one QT. Leo and Brad at their best.", "One of the worst movies EVER !": "Heavyweight names in the casting and HUGE expectations but you will end up with a BIG disappointment !!The performance is good as usual from LDC but the movie lack all the good stuff for majority of the film !!!!I can't see any purpose of the story! Is it a documentary? Is it a biography? Is real? Is fiction?Doesn't worth the hype at all!!!", "Superb acting and directing": "After watching the movie twice it gets even better.", "Movie magic creating alternate reality": "Movie magic has long been used and abused to create present and future reality. But present can also influence the past, if only thanks to nostalgia. Here movie magic powers are summoned to right an horrendous crime and erase the disgusting behavior, people and organization related to it. If enough people enjoy and approve this alternate reality, the past will be rewritten.", "What a hell did you smoke?": "I can't believe 3 great actors play in this film.\nA film without any idea behind, no teaching. Just 10 minute of useless violence at the end. This world just turn upside down.", "From 3 to 8 stars": "Yesterday I say the movie for the second time.\nThe feeling I got during the whole movie was the opposite of the first time I did watch the movie.\nAfter the first time I felt down. I did miss a lot of things that er normally part of a QT-movie. I thought it was the worst QT I've ever seen. As a big fan I was sooo disappointed. Brokenhearted is the right word.\nBut yesterday I enjoyed the movie from the first to the last second. Wow what a ride.\nReally strange. I've never had such a different feeling after watching a movie for a second time.", "Rick Dalton & Cliff Booth #": "Perhaps Quentin s weakest film till date , Quentin s whose movies are characterized by nonlinear sequences , satirical subject matter, showcase of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts, & references to popular culture , this movie stands out as a first time attempt of Quentin's cinematographic debut , trust me it's not that it's a completely different film from the usual Quentin s stuff , Ideal concept , stellar star cast , and a theme based in the Hollywood with the main subject of the film being the Cult Manson Family Cults s , and a hardcore concept to explore given Quentin s directorial sequences, but the movie sadly holds a very weak sequences, the first I have seen in a Quentin s film , but the movie has very deep acting sequences and a lot of effort put thru by Leonardo Di who stars as Rick and subsequently Brad Pitt whose stars as Cliff Booth , these two starring as stalwarts for the Hollywood theme #I was expecting a D Unchained kind of spectacle against the cults s by the Manson Family , so it's more of a pictorial movie where you keep guessing till the end what happens on the night of Sharon Tate's cults which is the only icing on the cake as the climax addresses the beginnings of the cults s perpetually interfered by a Vintage Brad Pitt who kicks ass as the Manson Members approach Leonardo house , this is the only scene laying justice to true Quentin s Style & is the epic climax in the movie, expected more of Hateful Eight Climax ,but they haven't shown the cult of Charles Manson nor the cults of Sharon Tate which is supposedly the main motive of the film and in the end have teased it so I am not sure , what they have shown is Leonardo 's struggle to find footage in Hollywood assisted by his stunt double Brad Pitt played by a Vintage Brad Pitt ,now if Quentin s wanted and according to his style of nonlinear sequences he could have shown a lot of sequences like Leonardo Struggle , Cliff Booths Action Stunts , Roman Polanski in his directorial Attempts , Kurt Russell trying to hammer it in as a Producer , Al Pacino actually predicting events , The Cults of Bruce Lee , subsequently Charles Manson's Cult or A Western being shot with Quentin s in it as he does make guest appearances in his movies, And so on and so forth so if you think it's an ideal concept for a Quentin s Movie based on the backdrop of Hollywood in the Golden Era with so many narratives so very disappointed by the flow of the movie but kudos to Leonardo & Brad Pitt showing immense acting to portray Vintage America , but certainly expected a lot more given the hype, & was expecting a dark gritty tale involving Roman Polanski & Quentin # Can't believe but even Hollywood can get it wrong with the concept # Encore Quentin s # perhaps a Western The Next Time based In Japan #", "TERRINTINO DOES IT AGAIN!!": "Ever since I saw The Reservoir Dogs, I knew I'd be a fan forever!!!\nHe did not disappoint!!!\nAlways keeping me on the edge of my seat, and the twists and turns... Love it!!!", "People say the ending is good. Maybe.": "This was the first movie I left before finished.\nAfter about 2 hours or so.Thought it was gonna be great, but it takes more than famous actors to make a good movie.Maybe the end I missed makes the the movie \"worth it\". I doubt. It was slow and boring. And I don't even usually have problems with slow movies so....Complete disappointment.", "Not the best of Tarantino's work but still a great movie whatsoever": "The cinematography and aesthetic was amazing, it really immersed me in the world of the movie. The acting was amazing, especially DiCaprio's performance. My favourite scene was the ending, it was that kind of sadistic hillarious thing and the refferences to past scenes in the movie were genius, especially the flamethrower.\nWhat I didn't like was that Margot Robbie's talent was kinda wasted on a little role but I might be biased as she is one of my favourite. I also didn't like that they didn't show Sharon Tata's murder or atleast talk about it. Another thing is that a few scenes were too long and boring, like Cliff Booth driving for so long without anything happening or too many scenes with just smoking. I mean, they were aesthetic but due to them, the movie was kinda slow. It did pay off for the ending, though.\nOverall, a movie that can be appreciated especially by people with a dream of making it in the movie industry.", "Should haven chosen a different story": "The entire cast, atmosphere, decor and other related factors for the movie were definitely a solid 10/10 and it really gave me the feeling of going back in time.Personally, the problem laid into the story and the slowness of it. If I could have chosen a different approach and story then I would have focused on the Manson character and it's cult. More similar to Django.This movie could have been a 10/10 for sure! I think the story was too slow with no action at all..", "I enjoyed the movie (but)": "I enjoyed every minute of it. That said, it felt a bit long. The slow start, might be why.However, the ending was amazing. The last hour or so was excellent.I give it 7/10. The ending was 10/10.I will watch it again.", "No Plot, No Reason": "Don't get me wrong, the cast is great but what the hell was the point in sitting through something for almost 3hrs that doesn't fully engage or even give you a plot to suck you into the characters and setting. It's just so pointless and the fact they tried capping it off with the over the top ending really made me understand Tarantino is losing it. 5/10 is more than gernerous. Get off the Tarantino hype train please.", "I love the others. This not.": "I like spaghetti westerns, I like Leone and Corbucci, and many films from 60's and 70's. I know what Tarantino wanted to show. The cast is great, but this movie is bad. The worst that Tarantino ever done. I was waiting something along all the movie and I was finally disappointed. Missing argument.", "Still better than Spider-Man 5": "This is definitely not Tarantino's best. Great cinematography, acting, dialogue, etc but there isn't a plot which means it's kind of boring. But what else are you going to go to theatre for? Ironman 8? Bad Tarantino is still worth watching.", "About Storyline": "I dont there was main story in this movie. Yes of course i got main idea is film industry in 1950s but i think that should be background of movie storyline should be something more", "Not your typical Tarantino movie!": "This is Leo and Brad at their best! They are allowed to show their acting ability to its finest. Especially DiCaprio in the Saloon scene. Tarantino paints a great picture of Hollywood in the late 60s and makes the story about the other characters and not the Manson family. We finally got to see typical Tarantino justice if you will at the end with Cliff and Brandy kicking some major ass!", "A great movie": "Its an amazing movie if you want to enjoy it you must know the history of hollywood if not you can learn some about it and enjoy the movie , great combination of Leonardo and Brad .", "Generally misunderstood and well underestimated movie in Germany": "I saw people leaving the cinema while myself enjoyed this funny ride and love story of an ending era and was really concerned about the lack of understanding the German people had for this Tarantino movie. There's really only one aspect what could give this movie a down and that is it's lack of a real leading narrative throughout the plot but I personally don't give a damn about it. The acting is great even thou Margot Robbie gets a little too much appreciation for her non verbal acting in my estimation.", "Totally let down": "I was prepared with for a epic Tarantino film experience. NOT! Long and boring. Endless driving scenes, scenes that were good were too short and those that were bad too long. Where is the editor? Just put in every single frame that was shot?\nStory went nowhere and the big twist at the end. It was comparable to Basterds in the fiction account of \"what if\". Narration was silly and not justified. No Chapters. A Tarantino trademark. Overall it was the worst Tarantino effort to date.\nThey gave it a standing ovation at Cannes, it was probably because it was finally over!", "Not for Action/Adventure fans": "Movie plot does not have a build-up structure towards the end - It is just a representation of a two buddies hanging around for a couple of days, and alternative history at the(very brutal) end.Every character in the movie is watching, discussing and caring for TV/Movies as people watch, discuss and care for sports in real life.Movie is circling around movie related stuff too much in my opinion.Extremely good crafted movie. Should be studied in the film schools.", "TERRIBLE!": "I couldn't watch even half of the movie! Nothing happens. You know that movie that gets good ratings and you are left scratching your head in disbelief. That is this movie! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!", "Best Tarantino ever? (I wonder...)": "A masterpiece that (unfortunately) not everybody will fully appreciate unless they see beyond what's being shown. There are so many layers, so many references to so many things that went on during the late 60s, so well depicted, so well recreated,that you will crave for a second viewing. It's about relationships, abandonment, rejection, hope, acceptance, understanding, and so much more... And there's the feeling how things would have turned out to be had the circumstances been different. Great film, great performances.", "Very interesting concept": "The movie overall has a great aesthetic, great for lovers of 60s retro. Great cinematography and an interesting story that ties itself to the horrific case of the Manson family. Compared to other Tarantino movies, it is quite slow-paced, more of a driving around Hollywood, having a good time thing, while the character played by Leonardo Dicaprio is dealing with the decline of his acting career, hoping for a better role, that will get him out of the bad-guy character that he always plays. His stunt double, played by Brad Pitt, has an accidental meeting with the Manson family.\nThe last 40 minutes of the movie consists of an action packed revenge on the Manson hippies, delivered by Brad Pitt on acid and Leonardo Dicaprio with a flamethrower. Sincerely, an ending worth waiting for. An ending in which Sharon Tate does not die and lives to give birth to her child.", "A homage too late 1960s Los Angeles and Hollywood for 3/4 of the movie": "The first 3/4 of this movie was basically a retrospective and a homage to 1969 and late 60s Hollywood in Los Angeles. It did drag, but there were so many Easter eggs in there that people who actually lived through that era recognized all of it.The story wandered and it did come off as boring during this.. The weaving in and of the fictionalized occurrences using the characters from the movie with the Manson family was brilliant at the end, which essentially saves the movie from being pointless. The performances in the movie were actually very good. The actors did what they could with the \"script\"...There were great visuals and it certainly had the feel of that era in Los Angeles. The quirky change with where the Manson family goes was interesting and left the audience with a what if wonderment....", "Have QT lost it?": "There is no story!! Boring \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00a3\nI was realy looking forward to this film, but all I got was a Big dissapointment.", "The amazing Tarantino universe....": "Mr Tarantino created a universe just like the 60s era and made sure that everything looks exactly like it.\nWith his interesting characters he gave the history a twist and left us all amazed by his vision and his love for old cinema ..\nThere are certain references to real life incidents , the last 25 minutes will leave you astonished ..", "I wasn't impressed": "Sorry guys, I really wanted to like this movie. Perhaps it was my friend chirping in my ear about the real story, but I just couldn't get in to the movie. It was funny; Leo was exceptional, and Brad Pitt was hot. But it was boring, and kinda predictable. Charming for sure-great cameos, but...it was...meh. Just not all it was made out to be.", "This is Quentin Tarantino": "I really like this movie. It's as if he, Quentin Tarantino, is showing how he solves his anger through a movie. And that way fits me very well. I didn't know much about the times of this movie, and I was not born. But the movie made me wonder about Sharon Tate and her movie. In fact, this may be one of the biggest achievements of the film. The main character of this movie is of course Brandy. To be honest, I watched this movie to see Leonardo Dicaprio, but I fell in love with Brad Pitt and became interested in Brandy, who made a cruel scene. When I watch Leo acting in a movie as a Rick and Rick acting as an actor. I realized once again why I was crazy about films. I love difficult movies. But like this movie, I sometimes go crazy about stimulating and cruel movies. However, if you know the background, it would not be just a pleasure movie. Honestly, this movie is too long. I know it. So I watched this movie separately for several days. I like this director's movie. After watching this movie, I have watched his other movies again and watched them from a new perspective as if I were watching them from his point of view. So I thought it was the director himself. I thought I wanted to be free from expression also. Of course I don't know everything, but at least like this movie.Rick's acting scene made me dream. So this movie is valuable to me. You have to realize how important enthusiasm is.", "Must watch without any expectations": "Tarantino is difficult to predict, but this film was definitely not expected. Even devout fans will likely appreciate Tarantino's latest after processing it a while after the fact. You have to watch it with no classic Tarantino expectations, no significant news-of-the-time tie ins, and an appreciation for the evolution of Hollywood. It is not an action movie, and it is unusually reverent for Tarantino. The cinematography is splendid, but the characters and plot (if it can be said to have a plot at all), with the exception of Pitt's (wonderfully delivered) Cliff Booth, are not engaging. The film is simply a nostalgic homage that has been \"thought\" to death by fans and critics. There's not spectacular insights to be found here.", "Don't waste your time, don't trust the rating - it's way out of the normal": "I might not be good in this industry, but honestly, don't waste your time watching it... The movie has no story, and except for some funny scenes, it has nothing. Indeed, they play well, but they are actors. The scenes don't connect between them, they have nothing to do one with another, i don't get it why they filmed so long, 159 min, it has no reason... you wait all the movie for an action for something to happen, but except for the last 15 min, nothing happen, which is sad.I didn't read and watched any plot/review/trailer, i was convinced buy the rating and the casting... i still don't get why it has such an high rating, but anyways, i'm not here to understand this...Maybe i had too high expectations from such a producer and casting, but it was disappointing in my opinion.", "The most boring movie ever": "I love Tarantino (normally), Brad Pitt, Leo Dicaprio and Margot Robbie. But this movie was the biggest waste of my time. Literally NOTHING happens the entire movie.", "A First for Tarantino...": "Okay, you sit down and watch this movie for your first time, and it's good... just not great. Somethings comes over you and you decide to watch it again, this time you grow a deeper appreciation for the film, yet you feel as if there's a chunk of the movie that's just not there. That's exactly how my feelings were about the movie, until one day last fall it was announced that Quentin Tarantino had signed a two-book deal with HarperCollins for two books of his to be released in 2021, and the first of the duo being a \"novelization\" of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (novelization of sorts.)Fast forward to present-day (September of 2021) and I've finally gotten my hands on the book and completed it, which has led me here, to re-watch and review the movie once more. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. Everything now get's new perspective after reading the book, the story seems fleshed out, the characters seem more real with a genuine history that has been explored in the book, now adding to the subtle (and not so subtle) nuances of each character. That all comes with a big question mark yet, or maybe a disclaimer of sorts; the very existence of this book now creates a category of things that are essential what we'll call \"companion pieces\" to the movie. Obviously the movie existed in the publics eye before the novel came out, however, now that we have the novel I can't help but feel it has rendered the movie maybe unwatchable for some who like to know everything about what movie they're watching. Something I felt in my first watch, and now I feel stronger after reading the novel is this sometimes overbearing sense of watching a bunch of inside jokes being fired off back to back. With the amount of extra backstory the book provides, compared to the payoff the movie gives for reading the novel, I suspect I'm not alone in this feeling. Even if the group is microscopic in size.This is a debate that has gone on in the world of video games for quite a few years now, admittedly it's not one I'm willing to spark in the world of film, yet it s something to think about the next time we have a major movie that coincides with a companion piece of sorts for it, do we make the companion pieces into essential pieces, or do we keep them as a bonus for those who are content just watching the movie and nothing more?", "Another film that's more about the art than story": "I'm a huge fan of QT but this has got to be the worst film he's created. It's just another one of those films that will be overrated just because of the music and camera angles not because of the story I didn't ever think QT would make a film like this but here it is and I hate to say it but it was boring!", "Tarantino leaves me unimpressed.": "Bloated and meandering.Artfully filmed, and well acted but ultimately unfulfilling.If you like Tarantino films then this is another you should like.If you are tired of hearing how great Tarantino films are, avoid it. It's more of the same. Almost 3 hours of characters you don't really care about and when the climax comes, much like a hooker, you're mostly unimpressed and you're just glad it's over.", "If you don't know who Burt Reynolds was...": "...then you are probably too young to understand and enjoy this movie to its fullest potential. 100/100", "This film is LIT.": "It's a classic Tarantino movie i think. Cast is really good. Acting, scenario, other details everything seems like should be. Little bit complicated but it's not a big deal.", "Written while watching": "I got so bored , I am actually writing a review watching it . This movie is so long and so indulgent , that many scene is unnecessary .. I don't know where in the world is this movie taking us .Even if it's for a tribute to Hollywood , the script should have been better written . I feel it's all over the place .If it's meant to take us back memory lane this is not the one . The depiction of Bruce lee was not even accurate at allWe have 2 hours of meandering , and I think bringing us to the Manson murder . That is at the last half and hour .Wait for the dvd . So you can fast forward", "A 60 s movie industry treat of tales and wishes !": "Maaaan , I went 2 whole years without watching this because of the poor reviews it got .Then stumbled across it , something that really speaks to me personally as I love that 60s ,pre Burt Reynolds , westerns and stuntmen Hollywood feel which is somehow captured and bottled for us to open whenever we want . That being a personal thing I understand why others may not have enjoyed it .But if you know a little crime history and a little Hollywood history it's a delightful ride and I dare say for a few even a tale of revenge from the reality of the true horrors that took place that night .If you don't then it's a different experience I m sure but not a Bad one by any means .A few other unorthodox takes on tales from Hollywood which I m sure will get mixed feelings . Bruce Lee fans beware , a question is posed here that everyone has wanted to ask .Enjoy the ride , it's one I will try not to watch too often so I can treasure it longer .", "The first two hours are just fluff": "This movie is mostly a huge nostalgia trip to the 60s and then some good stuff at the end.", "Didn't expected much, still disappointed": "This movie is boring, the most boring I've saw in a long time. And this comes from me who like watching slow movies. I've watched slow movies like Blade runner 2049, 2001 a space Odyssey , what many considers boring and slow but I love those movies a lot, but this movie is what i call boring not movies like space odessey and Br2049 in which there's a great story and narrative going on.Yeah there are moments which are really fun and I really enjoyed them. But most of the movie is pointless. At the end what was the point of making this movie?", "Very, very, niche": "Let me summarise this as quickly as I can. I believe the majority of people won't like this film. The audience scores can be broken down as below10/10 Film buffs. Love everything hollywood. Appreciate the great cinematography10/10 Pretetious media studies students. Didn't really understand what was going on but could see it was stylish. The sort of people who know the majority won't like it so pretend they do. Will use words like juxtaposition in reviews.1/10 Action, pop corn movie types. The sort that need everything spelling out for them8/10 Margot's Legs3/10 Anybody elseQT fans are much harder to gauge. Some will love it. Some will hate it.For me, I like films to have a plot. There is a very faint one here. Stylish scenes and great characters are ok but I found them lacking. Brad Pitt has his moments and was probably the only really interesting character. There is a bit of gratuitous violence at the end which was typical QT.Maybe the point was Hollywood is full of people that you don't really like bit are just seeking to be liked?", "Expectations are set too high?": "Here's the thing. I am a big Tarantino fan. Growing up and having what was at first; a light interest in films soon exploded to high appreciation for this particular art. The films that i have seen in the past involving Tarantino have done nothing but amaze me. When i saw the announcement for Pitt, DiCaprio and Robbie were going to be involved in the next Tarantino movie i was so excited and eager to see what Tarantino was going to bring to the table. I recall one review stating it was Tarantino's \"love letter to Hollywood\" and you can see that with the authenticity of how much research and heart was used to make it really feel like Hollywood in the 60s. The acting from all involved was astounding. DiCaprio really took this to another level and was impressed through-out my viewing. So if i was to state what i feel was the foundation which held this movie up it would defiantly be the acting and the authenticity. Now if you have got this far you are probably wondering where the negative aspect is and why it's only a 6/10. Well here it is. The story. The story was missing something through-out and i often found myself questioning what was going on and where we were going from here through-out the film. So much heart went into the authenticity of the film i just feel like the story was over-looked some what. Take the sub-plot with Pitt going to where he used to film and there was the hippies living there. I cannot recollect the time that was invested in this particular plot but it was 20 minutes plus for sure. I am a fan of expectation subversion, that is the audience feeling that it is going one way when in reality the story goes off the rails in an enigmatic way to which we are left stunned an amazed. We had this really tense build up with Pitt going towards the house where his friend supposedly lived. There was this underline hostility from the parties living there and it was really nerve racking to think what would happen in that situation to Pitt. Yet despite this build up with felt like there was no other way it was going to go besides down a dark path, Pitt finds that his friend is there and everything is fine. Slight drama with his tyre being slashed but that is it. Really long build up with the cinematography and the score to reveal nothing, the most boring outcome possible and we feel like we just wasted 20 minutes of our time. I appreciate that the conflict that occurred at the end of the scene led the chain of events to happen at the end of the film, i get that. Just don't feel that it should of been so suspenseful and drawn out as it was. The end action scene was the Tarantino stamp on the movie which i thought was incredibly brilliant and thoroughly enjoyed. There were elements of comedy which also made the viewing somewhat enjoyable. I'm not saying that i don't like this film, i'm just saying i didn't enjoy it as much as i thought i would. Again i feel like this comes down to expectations are too high for something of this caliber and when it falls even less then what you expected, it knocks the whole experience. For me this is a film to watch once, i wouldn't necessarily watch it again.", "A pleasure to follow these 2:40 hours of cinema, thanks Tarantino": "Greaaat, i really enjoyed the entire second of the movie, i already watch 2 times!", "The first Tarantino's film appropriate for children": "At least the first third of the movie seemed unnecessary, especially the western scenes, because I don't like this genre, but I like the grand finale, when everything fits together and starts making sense. It's a lot less brutal than Tarantino's previous films, but it was still worth it. The icing on the cake was a cigarette ad in the headlines. And the best line: To my wife and to my love! May they never meet.", "What is this about?": "I saw every movie Tarantino did, but after two hours I was asking myself what this is about. Good or bad movie? After two hours I was considering leaving, because nothing happened! Very disappointed.", "Don't see it if you don't know Hollywood in the late 60s": "I am not a movie fanatic and I don't know who are the names in the movie and what happened to them in those years in Hollywood. And the movie doesn't explain.\nSo if you are like me, you will waste your time and won't understand a thing. I went there for Pitt and DiCaprio but walked out of the cinema after an hour, confused and irritated by my lack of knowledge and Tarantino's infatuation that everyone else knows.\nNews flash Mr T: most viewers are in their 20's or 30's and don't know s**t about that period either.", "does not need Audio": "I would not argue with many of those who voted to bring the movie to 7.9, that i do understand the complicated cinematic genious, but i got the feeling that this movie would even score higher if there was no Audio at all. Yes, no audio only video. The watchers then would look closer, would argue and wonder what exactly happens, would search easter egs ans so on. The audio ruins the movie as it undoubtedly prooves that a bunch of people made it for themsleves and their acquaintances and before the premiere they implied how good the movie is. It is not good. It is not even mediocre. This is a very good example of a succesfull attempt to do nothing and brag for waisting people's time. I really believe that like anybody who sells s**t, bad movie makers should also refund cinema-goers. Spoiled my winter holiday. Good side is I don't just like inglourious basterds, i find it a masterpiece. That movie is not a 1000 piece puzzle, but 1000 pieces of 1000 different puzzles incompetently assembled in one.", "Drug out over 2 hours for no reason. Disappointing!": "Seems every other word for no reason. Not much point to plot until last 15 min and then violent and gruesome for no reason. Good actors but they couldn't help poor plot.

I admit I just don't get his style or message so probably my mistake for going in first place.", "Classic Tarantino, incl. bloody ending Great Leonardo": "Great music, great cars, great dialogue. Looked a bit patched together, but nevertheless. If you like retro 60/70's nice to see the first 2hrs. The one he kept me looking was Leonardo. Great acting!\nDuring the film seeing Sharon Tate didn't help, when you know the real story about her horrible death. I got uneasy with that and wasn't eager to learn more. There was no break, so after going for a #1 I didn't feel the need to go back.\nHeard from partner the ending was bloody as usual, so didn't feel a miss. Specifically not with those Manson murderers. I didn't want to waste more time on them. Too bad the story couldn't do without Sharon. Probably not much going on besides that.", "So a best film ever amd a new generation of film ...": "Actually this film at least of tarantino's best film but at the 45 minutes of the end actually not meaningful and before i watch this i thinking about leonardo and brad pit ,, but this is the best film...", "it's like a vegan diet, all hype no reward.": "Don't get me wrong, the actors were nothing short of spectacular.

Also, Tarantino is greatly overrated...people all say what a great 60's Transformation this movie was? I didn't see it, he didn't even manage to keep modern LED street lamps out of the frames, nor didn't he drive along old stretches of roads, he rather picked new stretches IMO...he could have filmed much better parts in LA where you'd have had a greater 60's feeling but not where he filmed it...also Sharon's place didn't look at all like Sharon's place really looked, I thought he would have tried harder to re-create this house and garden and driveway.\nSteve Mc Queens character was bad, Bruce Lee's too and especially Roman Polanski's. For me this movie didn't really work.", "Slow 2.38 hrs.": "Cinematography is perfect but the editing has us staring at Brad & Leo for too long. So slow.

Just loved this film along with the performances from the stellar cast.", "I was struggling": "I didn't get the movie but the last 20 minutes made a lot up.

And a scene where Leonard pushes a young girl and scolds her ( part of a acting inside the movie a sub film we could say ) at that point of time I was fascinated by the intense acting of Leonard and obviously we all know how great he is when it comes to acting.\nAfter watching trailer I was pretty excited about what character would Al Pacino would be playing but after watching the movie .hahahah\nAl Pacino was just a click bait we could say. He just had a Cameo in the begining.\nAnd God know why they had this Margot Robbie's character in it .\nThough at last you could conclude something about that character but still that character could still be more impactfull.\nThe dog in the movie did a fantastic job too . He was the one because of whom I am giving this movie 1/2 star more .This movie is just a one time watch for me although I might see that dog scene at last on YouTube or somewhere but not the whole movie.Ps: Movies are subjective.", "A movie that's just...a story.

Is this going somewhere?", "Lack of a Good Storyline.": "Disappointed Totally.

I hope and fear Tarantino did not have much to do with this one. Great acting, awesome scenes and random ideas but the fragments don't add up unless you are a meta fan and get emotional for the historical background. Still it makes you think, which is a good thing. Two stars for Brandy, who isn't even listed as an actor on this IMDB page. Shame!", "A Love story to something": "That was some sort of love letter to the Quentin Tarantino idea of Hollywood he has a romanticised version of old Hollywood that likely only existed in QT and 8 year old boys heads all over America in the 60s. QT made a movie that seems to have no real story goes nowhere and upends any semblance of script writing skills you might learn at UCLA or some liberal arts college on the east coast, however it is still one of most engrossing fast films I have seen since Goodfellas. I had to pause to look around before all that bubblegum Hollywood POP was gone. It was junk food that actually filled you up. In amongst the movie was Sharon Tate (Robbie) seemingly on her own little story with virtually no connection to the two main protagonists Pitt & dicaprio it was a small part for a big actor that again seemed to be a lot bigger than it was. QT did that with this whole movie the sum of its parts is actually greater than the whole this is a beautiful love letter to Hollywood that we all hope existed and after seeing this I almost believe that it did. Great movie u there with PUlpfiction but visually similar the writing may even be better if the story is not.\n8/10", "A look at Tarantino's inspiration": "Quentin doesn't stop being Quentin in this film, but he lets us see a more honest, introspective and personal version this time. Tarantino tells us this story as if it were a crocodile bedtime story and incidentally introduces us to one of his great inspirations, the other Sergio (Corbucci) as one of his teachers, but he does so with a human story, which shows us the protagonist Rick Dalton (Leo DiCaprio), as a middle-aged, professionally stagnant Hollywood actor; and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), his former stunt double turned chauffeur and buddy for hire, having a half-movie buddy tour. And half Homer's odyssey. As in Inglourious Basterds Tarantino freely assumes the reconstruction of history, but this time in doing so, he voluntarily or involuntarily allows us to see through the beliefs, fears and aspirations of the director himself.", "The Story,": "About a story..... of life, but real life is not to fancy at all.

It was almost worth the wait.", "Very nostalgic & suspenseful": "If you lived during this time, this movie will stimulate a lot of feelings.

Fantastic!", "Strange": "I went to watch a film I thought was about the story of Charles manson, what I saw was a film about Leonardo dicaprio's character and the struggle he had to maintain his acting career. Don't get me wrong dicaprio was brilliant, so were the rest of the actors.

Great drama, suspense, acting and direction in just the last 10-15 mins. Quintessential Tarantino! But was nowhere to be scene in the rest of the movie.And even then, it was so infuriating the way they treated the hippies in that scene and rest of the movie, like insects.Sure, one can argue that they are not doing anything meaningful with their lives. But neither are these mega rich elite celebrities! This whole movie is the perfect showcase of that argument! Especially Margot Robbie!! 3rd Top Billed cast in this movie behind di Caprio and Brad Pitt!! For what!!! She was in this entire movie just to watch another movie! WTF!!!!!!!!!I understand the 90s Tarantino nostalgia and peak Leo, Pitt, Al Pachino etc. But just a force bringing back of this nostalgia for no reason just leaves a stain on that legacy! If this becomes the first introduction of Gen Z to Tarantino, I'm afraid they're not gonna go back and dig up the 90s classics! On the contrary, they may even never do that after this!!

Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former TV western star and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is his stunt double. Dalton's career is on a downward slide and Booth is also his driver. Dalton discovers that he is living next to famed director Roman Polanski and his actress wife Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Booth is taken with Pussycat (Margaret Qualley) who happens to be a Manson girl.There is only one section of true tension. It's Cliff Booth going to see George at the ranch. The ranch is the best section of the movie. Dalton and Booth have a fascinating chemistry. Brad Pitt may indeed be too pretty to be a stuntman. All of this leads me to conclude that it would be interesting to have Booth go back to the ranch to save George from the hippies. He can shoot them all and have a smoke. Quite frankly, the reworking of the climatic incident lacks the power of the Hitler cinema. I also don't like this Bruce Lee. It reminds me of all the copycat Bruce after his death and I doubt he would do a flying kick to start the fight. Obviously, Tarantino is reworking the legendary Bruce Lee incident but it feels wrong. Tex also feels wrong. There is a reason to rework Hitler for a revenge porn. There is no reason to rework Bruce Lee and if he's reworking the Manson family, he may as well rework it to its full extent. Quite frankly, Mindhunter gives an alternate version of Manson which is infinitely more compelling than this. Tarantino has more than enough skills but he would have more freedom to do a lesser known crime.", "A superbly acted borefest": "On leaving the cinema after seeing this my I overriding emotion was anger after wasting 3 hours of my life and hard earned money on this pretentious drivel.So many people have raved about this movie and it reminds me of the old story about the emperor's new clothes. They think saying this film is great will make them seem intellectually superior to the ordinary film goer who will rightly see this film as boring as hell.There is no real story to this film and the whole Sharon Tate/Manson thing, which I was expecting to feature highly was completely tacked on and seemed completely out of place.Maybe I'm weird but I expect a movie to have a plot and a point. This film is just a 70's movie nostalgia trip and if I wanted that I'd spend 3 hours watching old 70's movies rather than this pretentious crap.The Tarantino that made classics like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dog's & Jackie Brown is long gone and he's on a journey to disappear up his own pretentious.The only reason I have given this movie any stars is because the acting especially by Brad Pitt is fantastic and the movie looks good. It's all meaningless without a good plot though.Avoid!", "A great movie with an interesting ending": "For those of you who didn't like this movie very much... you really should take a break from watching movies in general and reevaluate your ability to watch movies.

Pitt whistles at the dog, and be bites the intruder in the balls! Yes!! Then, DiCaprio brings out the flame thrower (cue my huge belly laugh in the middle of the theatre)!

However, the lack of an actual story beyond the Manson murders and the random life of the two main characters leaves you wanting more.

Good cast with no actual storyline.

Everything either is awesome or it \"sucks\". We made up some word called \"meh\" some years back, and that pretty much describes today's entire pop culture, from film to music. But I digress; Was I disappointed when I initially saw this movie? Yep, sure was. As I had read up on the Manson murders and was basically thinking everything in the movie was somehow going to be related to that. It wasn't, and that left me kinda pissed when I first saw it. But I'm a nostalgic head, & for that reason alone I was left intrigued to get a better understanding of it. What I came away with is that I still don't think it's a great movie, but it was extremely entertaining for someone that appreciates Hollywood's past and particularly, the whole draw of living in Los Angeles. It romanticizes the marriage of film making, being a star and living in LA, and if you're not enamored with either, you're probably one of the reviewers giving this one star.I guess my point is, a movie doesn't have to be great to be entertaining, if that makes sense. And just because you don't appreciate what the movie is attempting to do, doesn't make it the worst movie ever. I guarantee the same people that hate this film, think The Dark Knight was top 5 greatest of all time. Why? Because it was over-written and made you feel like you were smart when you were watching it, instead of just entertaining you. So you felt pseudo-accomplished by watching it, even though you probably didn't even get it. Because there was nothing get. This movie was simple, and yeah, kinda plotless. But it knows what it is, and isn't pretending to be something it isn't, and that's something you can't say for most movies (or people) nowadays.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays a fading once successful actor, Brad Pitt plays his stunt man, assistant and long standing best friendPros: The acting is superb. DiCaprio does a superb job portraying an famous yet fading actor. Brad Pitt does a great, solid yet understated performanceCons: This film is a perfect example of how a flawed script cannot save sterling performances by wonderful actors. The script is long, unfocused, aimless, indulgent and ultimately far too boring. I fell asleep for the first half of the film. And kept looking at my watch hoping the film would end soonIn short.\nIf you are a die hard fan of the 1960s, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Brad Pitt, then feel free to watch this.For everyone else.

Do your homework Quentin!!!!!--------------------------------------------------\nCorrection:The end scene of the little white trash murderers redeems the entire movie.

It was transcendental, and I give it nine stars!!!", "Great acting, No plot": "I'm gonna keep this short and sweet, with no spoilers. Up until the final stage of the film, I found myself wondering where this film was going. The performances of Dicaprio and Pitt were enough to keep me from walking out of the cinema, but not even these two Hollywood stars could get this stuttering motorbike going... Until the end.People hated the Hateful Eight (personally I loved it) but compared to this film, at least Hateful 8 had a clear progression from A to Z, whereas Hollywood went from A to B.

I gave it 4 stars, for the brilliant Brad Pitt, stunnning Margot Robbie and last 45min of the film, which reminds me of my old buddy Quentin.", "Very good movie": "I really enjoyed this movie. I was born in 1986 and I loved the look of this movie! Some really good shock moments. I enjoy Leo and Brad in this film. I like the soundtrack of the film too. QT should be happy with this film. Good job.", "More admirable than satisfying, but nonetheless a thoroughly entertaining piece from Tarantino": "The film, like its title, is a long one. Unfortunately, the 2hr 40min runtime unveils its perks only after reaching a turning point, in which a traditional Tarantino plot begins to emerge from the movie's pre-eminent focus on aesthetics and period detail. This is not to say, however, that this focus was ultimately a poor decision. In fact, it succeeds very strongly in creating a sense of nostalgia for those who lived throughout the 60s, or a sense of longing for those who did not. I personally felt as if this damaged the film's character development to an extent - time and place seemed to override its human counterparts. Rick's character was never one that I had a great deal of care for, but he did help in solidifying the plot's orientation around a mid-tier actor who is struggling to sustain the peak of his career. Leo DiCaprio's plays this role with confidence and flair. However, I think it is Rick's stunt double, Cliff Booth, who steals the show. Booth generates consistent interest with his silent charisma and we often find amusement in his nonchalant approach to pretty much anyone or anything. This is thanks to a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate, on the other hand, is granted an ungenerous amount of screen-time and dialogue. Whilst Robbie injects the role with plenty of vivaciousness, her character feels somewhat irrelevant, especially to those who are not equipped with context. This brings me to the second half of the film. Once the titular characters are finally connected to the Manson cult, the plot quickly develops traction and we begin to fear for the worst. Tarantino, however, gives his audiences a completely subversive climax that is not only wildly entertaining but also quite clever in its conformity with the \"happy ending\" trope of Hollywood films. It fulfils the film's purpose as providing a celebratory lens into what Tarantino and many others consider to be the Golden Age of the American film industry and the American lifestlye itself. After watching this movie, I felt slightly underwhelmed due to its uncertain character development but became more satisfied after recognising the unique and very personal directorial vision with which Tarantino was equipped. What I can say with certainty is that anyone will enjoy this film for its aesthetics and entertainment value. 7/10", "Tarantino is like saying \"I am here you see, think before ordering me to produce another film\"": "After watching it, made feel like I crushed cockroaches with my finger tips directly or eaten living caterpillars. Film had an impact so awful that made feel like Tarantino made an enforced jubile that could make every watcher of this movie to say \"Please Tarantino, don't make another movie again\".This film has tree parts: Layout, Stretching, and Explotion. Film starts with good character development and monologues as layout. At this point what you miss is the connection between characters. They live by but don't interact properly like there is a national border between characters.\nThen a narrator starts talking in the middle of the film with no introduction, and starts to force the actions move faster like: \"If I don't give a quick sum this movie won't end before 4 hours, hold on thingt and get stretched\". Then the finishing blow, the end scene where Tranatino shows that this is really one of his(!) movie in a very grotesque way. Normally as other 8 Tarantino film one is filled with anticipation to see how Tarantino is going to use violence in this movie as well. But the first layout part completely and utterly breaks that anticipation first and tricks you into believing that \"Tarantino is making a movie with character development.\" then at the end like clown popping out of nowhere \"Hehee did you really think that I am that kind of sentimental person. I am Tarantino and this is how I make movies!\" then he makes really disguised (and disgusting at the same time) pay back for Sharon Tate Homicide. He clearly shows where he stands for about the hippi (Charles Manson) and feminist-Marxist movement. I am not a big fan of hippies and their acts either but Tarantino's fictional revenge on the Sharon Tate murder feels meaningless, even after looking and learning about the scandal (I was ignorant about it before watching the movie).\nAt the end it feels like Tarantino tried to make 3 movies at the same time but instead combined them in shot and binded them with his addiction of violence. It also shows that without order and law people can and will kill eachother without and self restraint.\n<", "It's a \"love it or hate it\" kind of movie": "I guess I'm too young for this movie. I absolutely had no idea about all of the names that are mentioned in this movies (also not sure if they're fictional names). I give it a 5 only for the acting. The plot? No. Wait.. was there a plot? This movie would've been so much better if it based on true story kind of film, but it's not.", "Mostly boring, Too long. Leo saved it from total disaster": "I think this movie is one of the worst in Tarantino career. (haven't seen all of them though). Long \"supposedly meaningful\" (boring) dialogues, awkward, confusing (and unpleasant) scene with Bruce Lee, nothing innovative. DiCaprio is undoubtedly the best part of the movie. He saved it from complete failure.", "So what?": "This movie kept me waiting and waiting for the plot, for an exciting thing to happen. And finally after two hours of boring screenplay, the climax comes at the end. Leonardo and Brad were definitely the best, but, did Tarantino bring Al Pacino to be a flat, tertiary, and unimportant character? Seriously? Finally, the movie owes the dog for its fascinating play. Though, I believe I should watch it again to digest some parts. But for now, a 6 is my rating.", "A pretty and nostalgic look at Hollywood magic": "Once upon a time is filled with nostalgia about the Hollywood of the '60s; westerns, glamor and hippies. But it is a mess of a movie that leaves one asking what is the point? At times a faithful re-enaction of '60s era cinematograpy, at times modern shots. Suddenly a narrator that is soon forgotten again, and just a lot of pointless storythreads that make little sense in the end. All I am left with is the question \"what was the point of this?\".", "Lullaby for audience": "This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Tarantino tried to excape from his style and went to junkyard of creativity. This is just like you are trying to make a dinner from what you find in the kitchen plis you dont know how to cook at all.\nMessage to Tarantino: Art is not in acting and actors, not in hidden details, Art is in all aspects of the movie, and most important thing is storytelling.\nP.S.

Missing a storyline.\nI cannot hide my disappointment.The film is just pointless. You expect a complex fast paced enjoyable story, it's slow, uninteresting and anticlimactic.I had high expectations, but even with low expectations I would have been extremely disappointed with this drawn out pointless story. This is truth, anything else I would argue they are blinded by the great visuals, and great acting, clear the fog and the bottom line is a very poor film and story.", "Almost.. but not quite": "If you fancy a trip down memory lane-Tarintino's Hollywood memory lane, then this films for you.\nThe acting from Pitt and Di-Caprio is immense and there's a shuffle of notable characters from that period of time to keep you entertained.\nUnfortunately, that's all the movie really delivers, there's no central theme and a plot is eventually outlined and concluded in the films last 30 minutes. At nearly 3 hours long, you can't help but feel short changed at the finish. Yet, your still thinking of the film days later, re- examining what you watched, trying to find an argument against being disappointed.\nTarintino's films are held to a very high standard, such is the product he's previously delivered. There's an intellectual snobbery to judging Tarintino's films- if you don't get it, it's on too high a plain for you, but that's nonsense. If Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and Django Unchained are masterpieces, this deserves no more than a 7", "Not a bad movie!!!": "I was waiting for this movie since it was announced. I wasn't excited for any other movie of the year. The first 2 hour of the movie you'll find quite boring if you are fan of movies like Avenger , john wick etc. Although the genre of the movie is comedy but to be honest movie was not that funny which was quite disappointing for me. Its not the best movie of Tarantion but I can say that this is he best work of Brad Pitt. I think this movie totally belong to him, Cliff Booth the character he played is the best thing about this movie. And of course Leo was coming back to the screen after 4 years which also increase my excitement for the movie, his performance was great as usual his chemistry with Brad Pitt was really good to watch. The last 15-20 in of the movie wast the best part of the movie and that is the part the where I realized Yes it is directed by Quentine Tarantino. I would say this again you'll not like this movie and will not be able to see it in single go if you are fan of Avenger, John wick and other flicks directed by Micheal Bay.

She deserves a 10/10, gave 7 because of the rest!", "A collection of \"things\"": "I just can't take a QT movie serious anymore, it's like they have become a horrible pastiche of other QT movies (which, let's be honest only rip-off far better films).It's clear to see Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is QT once again indulging himself and just feels like a collection of \"things\" rather than a coherent movie. Utterly cringe worthy at times (the Bruce Lee and Steve McQueen scenes are so tacky) the film making seems to take a back seat to the played-out \"spot the obscure reference\" game that QT likes to play in his movies nowadays.I honestly didn't mind the slow burning pace of the movie that many people have criticised it for, the runtime was not the issue but rather the lack of actual substance to the film. One thing I would also like to note is I believed the ending to be in really bad taste, not the violence but the actual ending where Tate is alive and they casually joke about these crazy hippies, I couldn't even imagine what Tate's family would think of this!?", "A Big Mistake About The Real Historical Characters and The Real Facts!": "\ud83c\udfac\u270d Without any dubt, Mr. Tarantino is one of the best Directors, The Film's Cinematography is Excellent, But My Message for the story of his film is this\ud83d\udc49 Rick Dalton (Leonardo Di Caprio) Is fantastic and powerful character in this movie, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) Is Mostly good, His vain anger against the Manson family is deeply disturbing, In fact and as Sociological view They (Manson family) were all the youngsters and the victims from a very violent period, tumultuous, roaring and Very Tough from an unforgettable Decade in the history of America, Some of them were really naive & innocent, Mr. Spahn has no resemblance to what we know of him, Mrs. Tate Does nothing to do, only walking and watching her own movies alone!

I wish a had a fast forward button, so I could get home earlier from the cinema. I get the hommage to the spaghetti westerns,but come on, I could also watch an original spaghetti western if that's what it was all about. There was no plot, the dialogues were not funny, only good 2 scenes I've seen in the trailer already. Last 15 minutes of the movie were more bearable,at least there was something happening.

Needed to be a little tighter at the beginning. Loved the slow lingering pace and the creepy interludes. Also, the best soundtrack and music.\nExpect a slow paced historical drama and you will love it.I have seen this film twice now, once on the big screen and another time on a Friday evening at home. Upon first viewing, I was mesmerised by the setting, the characters, the references and most importantly the reverent, lingering character study of the lives of the enduring bromance between two men.Certain aspects of the movies are shot like a series of vlogs, for example a scene where Rick and Cliff just watch a show together. In another scene, Sharon Tate just goes to a movie that she was in. In yet another scene, Cliff just goes home and feeds his dog while watching TV. If you go into this movie expecting fast pacing and lots of action setpieces, one would certainly be disappointed.I appreciated the strange and creepy undertone created by the scenes showing the Mansion family hitchhiking through LA as they secretly planned their crime spree and a sense of foreboding from seeing an ecstatic Sharon Tate going around LA.On second viewing, however I felt that film was too densely packed with too many storylines and some moments where the filmmaker just wants to glory in Hollywood tropes and cultural references such as a sequence that puts Rick Dalton in the Great Escape do not help focus the story.", "SADNESS": "This film ruined me. My heart. My job. My love life. Deffo worth the pain and heartbreak.", "Long long meaningless dialogues": "Like in most Tarantino movies also in this you have very long dialogues which one struggles to put in context. Only after watching it a few times you get the deeper meaning or link. But in Tarantino's latest movie for me it is almost not possible to get it. I even missed a cynicism or sarcasm. I found most dialogues just boring. However, the late sixties set, costumes and music gives a good feeling of that time. And after more than 2 hours the end is quite fulminant and Tarantino fans will love it.", "Boring and not worth it": "Tarantino usually makes good movies and there are a few good parts her and there, but all in all it never really starts and is way too long.", "The Right View": "I really liked what Quentin Did. He does not only reproduced the Hollywood golden era with a lot of particular and details. He turned a real sad story into a different final empowering the capacity of Pitt and Dicaprio, creating a cult in TARANTINO style. Good Job Quentin!!!", "Actually Tarantino Has Some Claim To Bruce Lee": "He did promote Bruce lee in a subtle yet clear way in Kill Bill. As much as Bruce lee is cool and legendary, he did become introduced in a round about way through Tarantino to newer audiences.With that said, the white miniskirt is so sexy wrapped around those slender legs and as a man I suspect anyone down voting this film is anti nature or anti beauty or both.Very cool pooch!", "Needed more and less": "I love all things Quentin Tarantino thus why I still gave this film a 7.This has to be in his bottom 3 films he's made.The script had alot of plot holes. It needed more action, suspense and/or scenes including the Charles Manson gang as the movie loosely follows that narrative in history. Instead Tarantino filled the script with alot of non sense scenes, that didnt really need to be in there.Leonardo DiCaprio put on a lackluster performance but thankfully Brad Pitt's character saved the film from being too dry by adding humour.The ending however was violent, hilarious and what everyone was waiting for. Thank god.", "Interesting but Meandering": "Yes, interesting because of Leoanardo and Brad and Hollywood. But long, drawn out story. If you are an \" all things Hollywood\" fan, it's worth seeing.

I was loving it. Every minute of the movie was interesting to me, but not because of any \"bang! Pow! Punch!\" stuff.This movie did have it's shock value in the sense that I was shocked\nat how rare movies with this kind of \"look\" have become.... it made me very nostalgic (and not just for the 60's fashion aspects).I thought this movie was incredibly clever. It grabbed me.", "Interesting movie with a fantastic cast, but with some serious issues": "First, the best thing was the performance of the the actors Leo and Brad. It was a great comeback for both of them.The violence and quotes were there as we expect from The director.On the other hand, there were serious problems:1- The story telling is very bad, you fell that you watch different scenes that are not connected. The only important story is at the end of the movie. There are no scenes about the Manson family. How they started, what they believe on, and why they tried to kill Sharon. It seemed that every thing was a about luck. That why lots of people including me did not understand the end of the movie. This was the worst thing about the movie.2- In order to understand the movie you should know about the history of hollywood like the story of sharon tet before watching the movie. This is bad because the normal audience do not know about these stories. At least they should have gave as a warn to read about some hollywood history before we watch the movie. In addition, the name of the movie starts with ( once upon a time...) so, I expect the movie to tell me a story with the details, even if my background info is zero.Ultimately, it was a good movie.

There's no interesting or witty dialogue, as we have come to expect from Tarantino, and no captivating scenes.\nIn the theatre, I was waiting patiently to find a red thread or engaging story, but what we are left with is superficial beauty, expensive cars, mansions, pomp and style. Perhaps this was Tarantino's intent, to blind the audience with Hollywood \"glory\".\nThe strange take Tarantino has on the Sharon Tate/Manson ordeal reveals quite a bit, as if he is trying to please someone. I understand the title of the movie refers to a fairy-tale-version of Hollywood, but by God, what a dull movie.

But yeah, the whole genius of it, they ended it the way they wished it had \ud83d\ude04", "truly underrated": "It's a masterpiece...Thank you, Quentin Tarantino, sir <3.", "Really thought it would be better.": "For a movie that had a 8 star rating from imdb and other places I have to disagree.\nThis movie has good actors but you might as well consider it as a B grade movie. It does become boring even within the first 20mins and really doesn't get better from there.\nWish it was better under the circumstances!", "Good movie but not the best": "A bit slow start until the middle of story but towards the end, it become interesting. A bit confusing about Margot Robbie cast in this film, seem not related to the main story. Also i dont know the function of bruce lee character to this film. Dalton's wife also no big function to this movie. Film duration too long makes the film looks boring.Is it based on the true story or what?", "It was almost perfect": "Everything was splendid! The actors played like they were tailored to be playing those characters. The movie is as it's described in the title. It's about a story, maybe fictional, maybe not(since Once upon...) in Hollywood. You see the good, the bad, and the ugly in everyone. You can feel the two faced Hollywood, the fake, the truth and the reality.\nAnd the finale, IT WAS SO FUNNY yet scary, just amazing.The only downside it was the drag, you could feel that slow paced drag, maybe it's me and I like to see things moving faster in the films, maybe Mr. Tarantiono wanted to depict it more real, since in real life things do move slow, and when they move fast, God damn they do move fast.Overall, great movie!", "This movie would be more appreciated in years": "Let me tell you, I am not a big tarantino fan. I particularly didn't like pulp fiction to be honest. I felt like it was overrated. But as time went on, I appreciated it and liked it even more. I read many reviews saying that this movie has no plot, if you've seen any interviews with Tarantino about this film, he clearly says that this is not a plot driven movie but a look into the few days about the life of these two characters: Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth.I don't think there is a plot to be told in a movie that is character driven. As in real life, things happen slowly. This movie is really funny, has heart and in the end, it is a fairy tale. But the ending, oh my god, the ending is everything you want from a Tarantino movie. The last 20 minutes of the film, you will be rolling in your seat.This Movie is not perfect. The pacing could have been a bit better, and I felt that Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate was underused in this film. It's not Tarantino's best film, i think Inglorious Basterds and pulp fiction are his best in my opinion. This is not a masterpiece, but not as bad as what other reviews on IMDB are telling you.", "Ever see Team America? (Spoilers for both films)": "Team America has a running joke that actors think they're cool and tough and stuff. Gary would say something and everyone would say \"Wow!\" or \"That's the best acting I've ever seen!\" Then later other celebrities would say \"We can take them! We've been on action movies! We know what a real fight is like.\" Even when Alec Baldwin fails to out do Gary's speech at the end of the movie he dies, showing how actors view acting as 'life and death.'Anyway, Tarentino unironically thinks like this in real life and was probably reading about the manson family and said to himself \"Gee, this was a real tragety. I'll bet that if they broke into a stuntman's or an actor's house the killers themselves would've been murdered instead by a flamethrower or something.\" Then he made Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Disclaimer: I dont like Tarentino films (too much talking) but this was free from my local library. If I had to pay for this I'd've given it a lower score.", "Expected more than I got": "I love Tarantino films, and actor in this movie. And the problem was not in the actors. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, I love with their acting.The problem is, you are still waiting for something to happen and you don't get it. It's a movie that looks like there's a lot of cut frames when viewed. I was expecting something more than I got.", "This review was tough to write...": "First, this is my first movie review on IMDB, I created an account just to review this.Second, I am a HUGE Leonardo DiCaprio fan and a love QT's movies. Django is my favorite western and one of my top 10 favorite action films and I thoroughly enjoyed Inglorious Bastards. He always finds a way to fuse a solid plot with fun over the top violence that always make me laugh like a giddy school girl, things like the Bar scene in IB and the final action scene in Django come to mind.I went to see this movie the first week it was out and was extremely excited. I went alone because the people I normally see movies with said it looks boring. All I could think is, Brad Pitt + Leo + Margot + QT has to equal an amazing film that no doubt will be a new favorite of mine if it follows any of QT's previous films.Then I saw the movie... I waited for 3 hours for something to happen, and outside of the final 5 minutes, it was one of the most boring and dull movies I've ever seen. I nearly walked out halfway through. It was extremely disappointing and I want to like it so much, but I can't.As someone who loves cinematography and always looks for good lighting and acting in films I wasn't necessarily let down in this regard, it was okay, nothing like Django though. Brad and Leo did a great job in the acting, and I wish they would have given Margot more screen time, she didn't really give much to the film... mind you she is one of my favorite actresses so this isn't something I say lightly.I almost felt like Quentin was trying to \"prove himself to hollywood\" by showing off what he can do and knows about the good 'ol LA days, but I think he lost a lot of what makes him such an amazing Director. It was lacking the action, the plot, and so much more.I'd give it a 2 or 3 stars if it wasn't for good acting and cast, so I guess I'll settle for 4 stars.", "Utter rubbish": "Total waste of time and rental fee, I cannot believe a cast of this quality made this sort of film", "Not what I was expecting. Tarrantino has some big balls.": "You need to be familiar with the murder at Polansky's house and know some basic facts about Manson and his lunatics to appreciate the plots finale.\nI view the whole movie as a very funny joke. A dark joke in a typical Tarrantino-style. For this I give it 10/10. It's surprising and even if you somehow expect a twist, a deeper meaning reveals itself in a very QT style. In this context I would call it a cinematic art.The movie for me is about the tragedy that really took place and many aspects of it. From why it happened (Was it a pure coincidence? Stupid bad luck? Weird chain of events?) to how we view it today and talk about it today (especially in the context of Polansky's crime and strong opinions about him).I have some mixed feelings about parts of this movie that were kinda slow and didn't seems to have any meeningful connection with the plot. Maybe there is some nostalgy in it. I don't get it & I'm not american. Maybe it is just me but I couldn't forget that I was watching DiCaprio - an actor (Leo is magic and he doesn't age normally, he is and always will be a teenage boy). I choose to view the slower parts of the movie as a build up to the finale and a way to mislead a viewer to expect a certain story.", "Very cool insight as to what the culture of Hollywood is like.": "In Quentin Tarantino's film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the director pays homage to 1960's Hollywood. In one of his less visceral movies, he follows a somewhat washed out actor Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), trying to make a comeback in the film industry, via making connections with big names. From playing a western hero in a hit movie in the 1950's, to being the bad guy with a beer gut in new age westerns, it would seem he is losing his shine. Threatened with the last resort of having to star in lesser known Italian westerns, he is desperate for a comeback. Through this journey, we get a glimpse of the inner workings of Hollywood back in this time period, and how it created the culture we see today, all the while being subtly reminded that \"it's all about who you know.\"In my opinion, this was a great movie. Although the storyline may seem depressing, Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt) interrupts these melancholy moments with funny remarks, as well as different outlooks on the situation. It is also an incredible representation of how it would feel to be an actor on the end of a bell curve, a view we don't always see. Consequently, we are exposed to the drama that unfolds, whether it be relationships between directors and actresses, or actors accused of abusing women. We often hear about these sorts of things, but the earlier setting seems to point out that they have always been apart of the Hollywood culture. All of this is accompanied by incredible camera work, from the offsetting frames of the Manson's hideout, to the way they captured Rick roaming the movie sets.\nAt certain points, the film can seem to get a little bit political. Most of the women in the film seem like airheads, and are slightly demonized. There are a couple digs at the \"#MeToo\" movement, but no one can deny that it is a huge part of Hollywood, especially now. Also, certain scenes can be very dry conversations full of actor lingo, which almost seem canted towards actors themselves. There are also odd interactions between hippies and actors, painting them as invertebrate jellies, who thirst for sex. But this does end up propelling the story further, as members of the Manson cult decide to take revenge on the actors who filled everyone's heads with murder.So Tarantino's ode to Hollywood shows how much he really loves it, but also exploits the factors which we see problems with today. There may have been political jabs and overstepped stereotypes, but depending on your tolerance of these sorts of things they can easily be overlooked. The best thing about this movie is the level of insight we receive regarding how it feels to be not only an actor, but an individual who is slowly losing their luster. This is easily one of his best movies, simply because of the fact it is so captivating and relevant to what we see in the film industry today.", "A trip down memory lane through a mind warp": "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood hooked me in minute by minute. An eeriness wove through the story through the very end coupled with mysterious camaraderie.

Me I like/love his movies but I also have to turn my head and plug my ears sometimes. I can't stand the embarrassing akward \"oh no they didn't\" moments that just keep going. Tarantino is know for these and his over the top brutal killings. All thou there was no to akward moments, there was his famous bloody kills with his normal stly beat downs and death sense. Thank you Tarantino I just wish this was how the real life story went. R.I.P. Sharon Tate and the others taken by the crazy non-humans.", "Waiting for it to get good": "Great acting. Bad movie.

Tarantino used when he wrote and directed this movie...", "Surprisingly rich & restrained for QT": "I absolutely loved the brilliance of this movie. Wow! I have enjoyed many Tarantino films over the years, at least certain aspects, but this one affected me in so many ways I did not predict. The way the plot was threaded and woven was so fulfilling to me, so much unique intentionality. The acting, the pacing, the lighting, the bare feet and all the subtleties were not unappreciated! At the end of the movie I simply wanted to slurp in all the juicy creativity I had just enjoyed! \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2039Understandably, this movie is not for everyone, but boy did it hit the mark for me .", "interesting, but could be better when 45 mins shorter": "Saw this for the first time yesterday.\ninteresting, as i read about Charles Manson and his 'family' a lot.the film is too long, in my opinion, but what its saying is interesting, without there really being a plot...i think this film is about the big scheme and sherade that Hollywood is, starting especially in the 60's.actors were wannabe-heroes that thought they really were as smart, good-looking and brave as the heroes they played on screen. in real life drinking themselves delirious, watching television on the couch, especially their own series, watching how great they were; how bigga hero.Even Bruce Lee is a bigmouth that actually doesnt fight too well; the stuntman easily throws him around.actors always want a better role. another role. a next role. always afraid their fame will leave them.the stuntman is in between two worlds. he doesnt play a role; he is IN the movie, but not really plays in it. the stuntman plays himself and is as dynamic in the movie as in the outside world.When the Manson group enters the house of the actor, the movie starts, this time with the stuntman in the lead. He is on LSD for the first time. There is a big fight that never happened in real life; because the Manson group entered the house nextdoor, that one of Polanski/Tate.The sherade of Hollywood stays alive. The actor that thought his fame was fading realizes others think he is cool in the movies. just like he thought already earlier his neighbours were great directors/actors.Ugly hollywood wins again and the actors go on faking themselves in real their real life, wich is quite boring, filled with trroubles.sharon tate stays alive in this movie, wich is great.thats about what i got from this movie, after watching it 1 time. its nice. it gets you thinking. its not cliche, wich is good.\nits not an american: 'hero is angry. hero kicks ass' movie like lots of others.we are all just people. movies arent real.they show perfection on the screen, played by troubled actors in 130 takes for each scene...but we all want to be a movie-hero.\nor better yet, a famous actor.", "My old stomping ground": "What a hoot watching this film. The effort they made to get the scenes right is truly outstanding. Every license plate that I saw was the old, yellow-on-black. A scene at the end with the Schaeffer ambulance was mind blowing, as I was driving for Schaeffer at the time. That was the exact rig I was driving. I don't imagine Schaeffer had any of those still hanging around so I can only suppose they found the high-top and had it painted to match the period.", "It seems Quentin has run out of steam.": "Now it's not exactly as bad as some people claim it to be but it's not great either, definitely not a 1 star film and most definitely not a 10 out of 10. If I were to rate it on a scale of 10, I'd give it a 7.Great cinematography, props and music that successfully captures the late 70s. Great performance from Brad Pitt who most certainly steals the show, as for Leonardo DiCaprio, it's nothing he's not done before, it's pretty much the same as always, he seems to play the same character whichever role he takes on, by this I mean he's performance here is no different than his performance in films such as The Departed, Inception, Shutter Island etc, and Margot Robbie is just about serviceable, hardly her fault, she just doesn't get much screen time and frankly doesn't have much to play with in terms of material, basically any half decent actress could've played the part.The biggest problem and the one that ultimately drags this film down is the writing or rather the lack of it. Scenes are unnecessarily long, dialogue is average at best.\nI've got absolutely nothing against lengthy scenes so as long as they're interesting to watch or when building atmosphere and tension or even character development but regrettably the film offers very little in relation to this and thus adds to the total running time of almost 3 hours which as a result hurts the overall experience.What could be shown in 2 minutes drags on for 5 minutes and you can't help but disengage from the scene especially when the dialogue between the characters aren't very well written or that interesting to be blunt.It's a real shame because when it's good it's really good but the good is too few and too far in between, I personally think it was a missed opportunity on behalf of QT to tell a fascinating story about a fascinating time in Hollywood, but unfortunately it lacks the energy and clever writing and sadly falls flat in the end.", "An ode to movies industry": "Beautiful, intelligent, not something to be consumed and forgotten. Excellent cast who carry their weight. Engaging and as always provoking storyline by Quentin Tarantino. A fair bit of foot fetish suggestions, but I love the quirkiness and authenticity of Tarantino doing Tarantino and not submitting to the e-commerce of the industry.", "Epic": "How can anybody not rate this 10? Classic Tarantino film.", "Slow paced in an almost needed way.": "Although some people look at Quentin Tarantinos films with always some intent that it will be full of action and jaw dropping; this film is quite the opposite. Apart from a gruesome, well perpetrated scene at the end. The rest of the film could be seen as somewhat unneeded. Its almost a casual watch but Leo was amazing so was Brad. It got us to see how good an actor like Leo is. Overall it is slow paced but a brilliant watch. You could tell Tarantino almost made this film out of his own satisfaction but delivered it perfectly with Leo, Brad and Margot. The suspenseful scene at the end did make it better and more interesting. But real film enthusiasts would of loved this film. Especially if you are a fan of Quentins.", "Very well shot": "Great acting, great twist, good movie.

I don't really like the way he portrayed him....he didn't deserve it.", "Ultimate frustration": "Such a classic Tarantino movie, pictures is gorgeous, actors are fantastic, theme is so exciting... but......There's no character development, no surprises (other than the last 10 minutes), no suspense, no expectation for the next scene (to me, Tarantino's greatest quality, building up a tension that makes you crave for what is coming next), there's not much that can be spoiled about this film because not much happens, and nothing that happens plays any role in the story, as there is basically no story.In the end....such a boring film, a very upsetting depiction of Bruce Lee for the fans, and so so frustrating overall, because it looks gorgeous, and Brad and Leo are absolutely fantastic, at the top of their game.", "One of the Best ever!": "This was my first time watching a Quentin Tarantino movie. This Film is set in 1969 and tells the story of Rick Dalton, actor and his stunt double Cliff Booth.I absolutely fell in love with this Film and the unique style of Tarantino.

Pitt likewise; not much to work with. A lot of very pretty, very cool vignettes and stylistic flotsam and jetsam, but I never got a story I could sink my teeth into.I don't know if Tarantino is trying to be more subtle with his storytelling, and taking his time with exposition, but this movie was a good 60 minutes too long. \nMusic selection and casting top notch as usual, just wish there was a stronger narrative. 6/10.", "Fraudulent awards": "In short:1- Totally NOT FUN!!!\nI can't believe that this movie's category is comedy-drama\nIt's neither comedy nor drama\nIT'S NOT COMEDY!!!\nIt's almost NOTHING!\nIt's just a story based on reality2-You have to read a lot about real events to understand the film, and you have to watch it more than 1 time, which isn't worth that.3-Margot Robbie is a just white gorgeous body with lots of coquetry in this movie, not a professional actress.4-Brad Pitt plays his role very great, and he is deserving of that awards.5-I love Leo a lot in all of his roles, either this one.

Especially the murders that involves the pregnant victim. Then you will very likely see the actual value of this movie.Strong acting from Pitt and DiCaprio, and wonderful cinematography and storytelling. Hats of to Tarantino for bringing the kind of psych that I have never felt from watching movie for quite a long time.", "Tarantino's \"Hollywood\" is an unsettling place.": "I'm not sure what to say about this film. I'm definitely a little disappointed but maybe only because my expectations were so high. I was really into it in parts (The ranch scene was fantastic) and I'm not sure how I'd have preferred for it to play out but I have to say it fell a little flat by the end, despite some quintessential Tarantino motifs.\nIt's a peculiar style that Tarantino has chosen to tell his tale, and it's the first of his movies that I've watched where I had to remind myself this is a Tarantino film. Certainly there were plenty of his tell tale signs throughout, but for many passages it felt very unlike him; almost as though he was absent.\nThere are small touches, like advertisements on street benches and radio chatter in cars, that bring you subtly into the era, in a way that only someone passionate about it could think of. He has recreated a part of history that I never knew; One that almost touches upon fascination before making me recoil.\nFor so much of the first two thirds I swam in the mirage that Tarantino placed before me. Excitement filled me as the scenes jumped from one tangent to the next, the links never quite touching but close enough to keep me at ease. However, as story carried on, I began to get anxious.\nIt was the blending of reality and fiction that I found most unsettling. Like water upon oil, they slide amongst each other to form pretty patterns but they never properly mix. And in the end, after almost three hours, I was left with a feeling of 'what was the point?'.\nMaybe that's Tarantino's goal. The '... in Hollywood' alludes to the phoniness of it all, and that if that's how Hollywood says it was, then that's how it is. The truth is secondary to a good story. And even though Hollywood does this in order to make the cinematic experience more satisfying for the viewer, in this case, it feels like I'm being lied to because they don't trust my ability to stomach the truth.", "Maybe I missed something...": "But whatever this was, it will be forgotten\nDefinitely not a signature art work", "Great movie!

The movies in recent years are mostly all disappointments, higher the appraisal from media, greater the disappointment. I don't want to recall the terrible experience when I fell asleep during La la land in cinema and almost caught a cold. Most recent movies can not even interest a hard-to-fall-asleep passenger like me to watch during painful long-haul flights. With these movies in comparison, Taratino's once upon a time in hollywood is a very good one. However, it is not his best nor one of best in history as Taratino puts too many his own fixations in this movie, be it Italian westerns, recreating his golden age hollywood nostalgia, etc.It's a long movie, and requires a bit pre-knowledge on the golden era hollywood and the Manson Family murders. The knowledge of the golden era brings up the nostalgia to stay in mood to ignore the relatively boring and flat first 2 hours. Knowing about the Manson murder of Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski's wife keeps the viewer hooked to see how all three lines converge to the murder and how Tarantino would depict it. Neverthess, the foreshadowing is way too long and flat, mostly because of Taratino's own fixations---it is more of a personal movie to himself, in my understanding. He used a lot of tacnics to make it less dull for average viewer: charismatic actors, flashback, movie in movie, three lines slowly integrating through the same recurring elements, nostalgic warm yellow color theme, and the 60s music. However, even the nostalgic Californian warm color/lighting theme can only do limited magic. I got sleepy in the midway, and only the anticipation of the Manson murder is keeping me awake.The ingenious twistful ending compensates for the long foreshadowing. Until the end I finally see the cleverness in the title---Tarantino is telling a fairy tale, satisfying yet sad. History is cruel, but the blood-shedding director is getting soft in his old age. He indulges in the last glory days of the golden era Hollywood while not ingoring the unresting 60s America in the background. He pictures what could be a smooth transition, a gradual reform rather than a turmoil revolution. And it works better than depicting the harsh history---sorrow, compassion, and empathy are all magnified with in the dark yet humorous fairy tale.Overall, it is an enjoyable movie worth going to the cinema, which is quite rare nowadays. I only watched once, so I cannot say too much on the technical side. It succeeds as a good movie with the ingenous ending, but I feel it also fails to emphasize the main message with the ending---if time is the main message. Several interviews of Taratino and the cast suggest that Taratino wants to delivery the transition of time in this movie, from the old golden Hollywood to the shiny and carefree new time, from the struggling has-beens to the rising movie stars, from the glorious stars to the ordinary people who anomonously contributed the fantasy industry but could not afford to live on the fantasy land they build. The elements are there in the movie, bright and clear, but it feels that they failed to converge into the bigger theme--time.", "Indiana Jones Escape from new York Carrie": "Not bad but a bit slow.....Indiana Jones Escape from new York Carrie\nYup", "What like late 60s early 70s homage deal": "Tarantino.

Learning the really in depth details about the Manson Family and the murders opened so many details in the movie for me to see. Understanding all the little Easter eggs in this movie made it a lot more enjoyable to watch and made the film go from a 3 to a 7 in my opinion.", "Enjoyed it far more the second time": "I was a bit underwhelmed the first time i watched it as I was constantly expecting and waiting for something to happen. It did eventually, and it was worth the wait, but It wasn't enough to make me recommend the film to others and would probably have rated it as 5 or 6 out of 10. The second time I found a new appreciation for the dialogue, the wonderful acting and the cinematography. I now think its absolutely brilliant and have watched it over and over. I particularly enjoyed the final scene - it was a nice way to end after Rick spent so much of the movie doubting himself and who knows how his fortunes could change as a result of befriending the polanski's..."}
