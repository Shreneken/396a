You can guarantee that no matter what new horror film comes out it will garner posts on the likes of IMDb as being \"the worst horror film I have ever seen\". That is until the next big release, where we will go around the houses again... Ouija is just a standard boo-jump horror picture with a standard story line. Any expectation of any thing more would have (will do) led (lead) to great disappointment. It's one of those horror films that asks you to turn off the lights and just enjoy the quick spooky ride, then you get off the ride and quickly move on to something else. It's neither \"the worst horror film of all time\" or anything remotely original. It's Boo-Jump horror 101, so buy into that or leave it well alone. 6/10",

But no, Ouija is not fun. It's very, very boring.Everything about this movie fails on so many levels. The writing doesn't have a single original or interesting idea, and it doesn't even make sense in the end. The acting is dull, though that's largely due to the fact that our characters spend the majority of the film moping around their houses and at school. There's no way of gaining momentum of suspense when nothing is happening. The characters play the board game a couple times and there are a handful of cheap jump scares and bad effects. That's it. The direction is flat and indifferent. Worst of all, it's not scary in the least.Ouija is the absolute bare minimum for a horror movie, completely devoid of energy, inspiration, and any interest in telling an original story.",

And so, of course, I decided to go and watch the first film in the series, simply titled, \"Ouija\". I did so despite my having been warned by a couple of friends that it was a pretty bad movie. But, come on, how bad could it really be??? \"Origin of Evil\" is AWESOME....so the first one must be pretty good, right?Wrong. This movie is terrible. TERRIBLE.About the only thing I can say for the movie is that it does more or less follow the storyline of the prequel (although there are some glitches there, too), and as such it was marginally fun to find out how the story ends, so to speak.But, man, this movie just downright sucks all the way around. The plot is bad, the acting...is...OK, but nothing to write home about. The story is not developed at all, and it's like they just threw together a few general concepts and tossed it into a movie.All that said, it really is like they made the terrible sequel first, after the hit horror movie. The 2016 prequel is leaps and bounds better than this movie. But this movie itself is weak as can be. 2/10 stars....a rating I have hardly ever given before. This one's bad folks. Real bad.",

            "content": "\"Ouija\" has a pretty cool and creepy story to work with, an old spirit board discovered in the attack, suicides and haunting, a creepy legend that connects the board to the house of the suicide girl, it is all perfect horror subject matter. Unfortunately there is something missing from \"Ouija\" that makes it more spectacle than horror. The scenes build nicely through suspense, shadowy, eerie atmosphere, and great sound effects, but the end result falls flat. The big scares aren't really scary. The cast give well enough performances of these haunted characters. The direction and cinematography are equally stellar. You can tell money was well spend in production, \"Ouija\" has all the right components to be a real good horror film, unfortunately it all stays pretty PG. The horror seems almost pulled back into safer zones when they should have took that thrilling momentum and gone for some major scares. Not sure why they chose to keep things subdued. I mean really for what \"Ouija\" is it is a nice, creepy Halloween horror film based on an occult staple-the spirit board. And there are a few scare-ish moments that use the sudden shock gimmick to get a jump out of the movie-goer but still this film is far less exciting than say \"Insidious\" or \"The Conjuring\".",

Olivia Cooke and Shelley Hennig play a couple of college ding bats who played with this so-called toy when they were young. Now news is out that Hennig hung herself along with her Christmas lights. This doesn't make for a jolly good festive holiday. Cooke gets together with her younger sister, her boyfriend, Hennig's boyfriend, and a waitress friend and they explore this board in the decease's house. It's all too convenient when every parent and adult seems to have something better to do out of town for plot convenience. Or perhaps they knew how stupid this film is and skipped town. At any rate director Stiles White fails to impress viewers with phoney jump scares, many of which have been done in other equally idiotic films. He loves to linger that camera on that board piece that resembles an oversized guitar pic with a glass piece. Much of the so-called scares are hokey and more laugh worthy than a Three Stooges short film. Lin Shaye even makes an appearance as a bat crazy elderly to remind us that she was in the superior, but not great Insidious. The lighting and production is fair at best but the best thing to do with a film this bad is to join the characters when they toss the Ouija board in the fireplace. Sure, the board survives, but with a little hope, this pathetic showcase will burn. Score: 2 / 10",

As someone who has been warned time and time again about the dangers of using supernatural means to attempt to contact the dead, I found this movie to be highly entertaining in a cheap-thrills kind of way.If you are looking for a simple, clich\u00e9 supernatural themed movie to watch with close friends for a movie night, I'd definitely recommend.

I quite liked the performances and the characters, and the film managed to avoid the clich\u00e9 bratty kid sister which looked like looming up at one point.It is a bit too gentle and slow to satisfy hardcore horror fans, but I have seen worse horror films.

            "content": "In recent times, never has a horror film centered entirely around the Ouija board game, and perhaps for good reason - it is a bit too foolish to be believable.Ouija boards have been utilized in horror films countless times before, as a last ditch effort to communicate with a disturbed spirit on the other side when a medium led seance is out of the question. 2014's horror film Ouija instead puts the cause and focus of the strange disturbances directly upon the game itself.After one of their friends inexplicably is found dead in a suspected suicide, a group of friends turn toward her Ouija board in a desperate attempt to find answers and closure. When it appears a communication channel has been opened with the dead things take a dark and unsettling turn.Stiles White co-writes and directs this painfully formulaic film. What audiences should expect to get from Ouija is your classic 'strange occurrences, oh no people dying, let's investigate to uncover the truth to hopefully appease the spirits'. While formulas typically exist because on some level they do work, this one has been bludgeoned to boredom inducing death.Typically if a film is going to be this standard then some sort of redeemable part of it must shine through, either through stellar characters portrayed by undiscovered gems or uniquely gruesome horror scenes. Ouija is a film that opens incredibly weakly, like a rough cut that should have been a reshoot. Once the group of friends, led by up-and-coming horror queen Olivia Cooke, make contact through the Ouija board the terrifying scenes considerably improve but never prove wow-worthy and still border on clich\u00e9.The most substantial error in the entirety of the film is the overall serious tone. The teenage high school students are all a bit too earnest when it comes to using a Ouija board. Stiles and his co-screenplay writer Juliet Snowden just really have no idea how to write realistically for teen youths. There is no humor or sarcasm, no sass and no disbelief when one of the friends approaches the other to use the Ouija board.Teens, even in the event that one kills him or herself, use humor as a coping mechanism. if one of my friends said 'we need to talk to ____ on the other side' I would laugh in his or her face from the ludicrous nature of the proposition.Further everything that propels the story forward in Ouija is a bit far-fetched. Most of the teens are incredibly serious about dental hygiene, with several scenes featuring them flossing. The adults all must have minored in Paranormal Occurrences and How to Deal with It. Overall Ouija was not scary and the extenuating circumstances surrounding the plot were laughable at best.Check our website for more full reviews of recent releases.",

It turns out that the friend made a cardinal sin by playing a ouija board alone, which has allowed a spirit to escape and now it's after the friends.OUIJA is the latest horror film that offers up zero scares and zero originality. I know a lot of people are attacking this film because it's rated PG-13 but I'm certainly not going to do that. After all, JAWS was rated PG and it was pretty darn scary. This film here is the latest example of everything that's wrong with the genre and that's the fact that instead of building an atmosphere or any type of real tension, instead we're given a bunch of loud bangs that are supposed to scare us.I guess if you scare extremely easy and will jump at anything then you'll find this terrifying but if you've ever seen a horror movie in your life then it's doubtful that you're going to find much here. For starters, the characters are extremely annoying and especially the lead girl. The problem I had with her is that she's the one from the opening sequence that believes in the powers of the ouija board and yet everything something happens with it she's the first to not believe. I'm not sure why she's so smart at the board except when something evil is happening and then she's as dumb as a board.The supporting friends are all poorly written and just don't add anything to the mix.The CGI scare effects are all extremely lame. Another problem is that the death scenes are all unimaginative and contain absolutely no scares. Is there anything good about the picture? Well, it does contain some nice cinematography and there's no doubt that technically it's well-made. However, that matters very little because there's not a single scare to be found and there's not an ounce of atmosphere. OUIJA is a pretty bad horror film that is silly, unoriginal and not at all scary.",

            "content": "There is the potential for a decent horror flick here. Ouija is a classic game that has scared kids for generations. So to make it a prime topic for a horror film is a no-brainer. So what are the chances that the filmmakers actually took the time to write a scary story, or create a scary or intense atmosphere? One would hope so, but this isn't that type of film. Produced by Platinum Dunes, yes Michael Bay's film company, Ouija is a bland, by the numbers horror flick that lacks scares and ups the boredom factor. I give the film some credit, it started decent enough, but sooner than later it dives into the horribleness one would expect from a rushed cash grab flick. I find this film to be a prime example of what is wrong with the horror genre these days. I can't recall any characters in this film or what they did. It had people just saying lines to the camera and each other. The scares were boring beyond comprehension. The dreaded PG-13 rating destroys any chance for anything really scary, interesting or bloody. Ouija is a failed opportunity, one that could have given us something interesting. I'm not just disappointed in it, I'm embarrassed by it. Ouija is almost an insult to the horror community. Not even the lame third act twist (yes, I'm ruining the fact that there is a twist) is enough to give the film a decent finish. It hurts my brain thinking about this film so I'm going to cut this review a bit short.Expect to see a sequel sometime soon, just don't 'see' it.",

But here in Ouija, there's nothing, no suspense, no horror, no gore to be clear, nothing at all. And when the so-called horror comes in it's done with CGI. Don't get me wrong, when eyes are turning from normal to white I can dig it that it's done with CGI, but the ghosts disappearing in CGI, the mouths done CGI, in fact too much CGI, just see the last ghost appear, it's done on-camera but suddenly the CGI comes in again.

The trailer was pretty misleading based off the fact that certain things that happened in the trailer wasn't in the movie at all, which is kind of okay, since nothing really spoiled the movie. The beginning of the story was alright, and it didn't catch speed until near the middle to the end - where it got entertaining.The story itself was decent, it's not deep (but what horror nowadays is, am I right?) Don't expect the story to be mind-blowing. I will say, I adore Olivia Cooke, who plays the lead in the movie, but she didn't meet my expectations in this movie...her acting was, for a lack of a better word, lacking.IF you enjoy jump scares, this movie is definitely for you. Ouija has jump scares through out the movie, which made it a pretty entertaining watch.Overall, decent movie, nice jump-scares, okay-acting, but too abrupt of an ending. The movie as a whole was not bad, but the ending was a little disappointing to me. It seemed to end pretty quickly; I wished it was dragged out a little bit longer.Should you watch in theaters? Yes, if you are into the jump-scares. It's not the best movie, but it isn't the worst either.

Hippie or not, ALL the women of the 1960s were grubby, since they were afraid to take showers after what Norman Bates did to Janet Leigh in the motel room shower he had rented to her earlier that fatal evening. It took nearly two decades for that soap-averse female generation to move through the reproductive pipeline, a period referred to as the \"Baby Bust\" by today's sociologists. Similarly, bad things happen when ladies attempt to floss their teeth during the current release, OUIJA. Maybe dentists will be benefiting from this boondoggle a few years from now only on the feminine side of the street. It would not be surprising if the American Dental Society were handing out bushels of complimentary tickets as we speak for their teenage girl patients to go see OUIJA.",

            "content": "\"Ouija\" is somewhat of a paradox of a film. Imagine a movie made by the makers of a game warning you not to play the game. Now imagine the makers of a game warning you not to play it, but double-dog daring you to play it. I've pretty much just described Hasbro's supernatural horror dud \"Ouija.\"A girl is mysteriously killed after recording herself playing with an ancient Ouija board. A group of her friends investigate the spirit board. They soon find out some things aren't meant to be played with when they awaken the dark powers of the \"other side.\"\"Ouija\" is one of those movies where the kids involved do incredibly stupid stuff, make all the wrong decisions, and then die because of their bad choices. Unlike most teen slasher films, there's nothing fun or humorous here to be found. It's just one predictably bad action after the next resulting in death for whoever committed the transgression against the dead.Set up like a visual instruction manual, \"Ouija\" teaches you how to play the board game you know you shouldn't. It's like they're taunting you to play with fire. Imagine someone telling you not to do something, but then giving you exact guidelines on how to do it. The actors say the words they're supposed to and follow the rules to communicate with the dead\u0085 which is never a good idea, by the way. It all plays out like an over-extended TV commercial to sell the game.The ultimate message of \"Ouija\" is you shouldn't play with the occult. Unfortunately, the message gets a little jumbled up when the friends use it to do battle against the spirits. Okay\u0085 so don't use it unless you need to use it to fight the bad guys? Am I getting this right? \"Ouija is rated PG-13, of course. Why wouldn't it be since its target demographic is plainly teens looking for mild scares. It includes disturbing violent content, frightening horror images, and thematic material.Any Christian is going to have problems with watching \"Ouija.\" We're all warned from childhood not to play with the occult or communicate with the dead\u0085 and with good reason. It's pretty cut and dry in the Bible. When my wife found out I watched the movie in our home, she made me immediately take it out of the house and put it in the car. The film really does send a mixed message to younger viewers. \"Ouija\" is obviously an attempt at both promoting a Hasbro board game and creating a teen version of \"Insidious\" or \"The Conjuring.\" However, there's nothing to be found here that is even half as endearing or memorable as either of those two films. Even the little twist during the climax can't save the movie in the end.",

The plot revolves around a group of teens whose friend Debbie commits suicide and Laine, her best friend thinks that Ouija board was the cause.

It started out okay with actually nicely done opening (which is sadly the only decent part of the movie) and it looked like it was aiming to build some characters, but when the actual plot starts, it all fails miserably. A lot of false scares, that may only make you jump by the sudden loud booming noise you always see in jump-scares, if that. Then when they try to do actual scares, it's just so clich\u00e9d, so generic and uninteresting. The acting isn't completely bad, at least not by the lead, Olivia Cooke, who is a pretty good actress especially when you see Bates Motel. The plot is lazy just as the writing itself and then there is a lame plot twist near the end that doesn't really make much sense.At first I looked at it as no more than innocent entertainment, but as it went on, I just couldn't help but notice all the flaws this movie had.

Ouija is the pinnacle of the type of movie one would watch while doing something on a side and certainly not pay 100% of his attention towards it -- something well, which is not easy to do in a cinema. Then, you can always leave [...]What bothers me primarily is the extreme simplicity that resides into the movie. Secondly, the fact that I was able to anticipate 80 to 90% of the times when the scare was going to fall. At last, the fact that when the scary part DID fall, they were not as scary as I would have expected them to be.All I learned after Ouija was that it is the perfect movie to introduce somebody who hates horror movies to the genre but certainly not for intermediate/advanced spectators who love it.I remember my reaction at the end of the session and I was like 'what did I just watch' and it seemed like my friends had the same reactions. Unfortunately, I really do not know what to say and don't have much to say from a pure technical standpoint because it's just too simple minded and too predictable to really have anything of note and my post would be filled with unnecessary negatives.

One of the main things that really holds this one down is the rather confusing amount of time taken here to get the storyline set-up in this. It's quite early on that we get the trigger for the events to start in the apparent suicide yet there's a lot of time afterward not only for the discovery of the body but also to start with the collective attacks against the group which is handled in a rather confusing manner. There's several occurrences of them playing with the board and yet nothing is really done for those times which really tends to ignore the fact that each of these previous encounters had resulting in something going on and then doing nothing with them as the supernatural activities observed from the first such encounter should've been the clue that rang out something was going on. This drags itself through several of these throughout here which manages to force the pace into such a crawl that it's hard to stay invested here and then causes the film to bring out a ludicrous twist in the final half just to bring the film up to a respectable running time since the rest of the pacing is so slow and dragging it has to rush through the biggest part here even after already dealing with it already and throwing another curve-ball simply to beef it up even more. Likewise, the film's timid-ness and rather lame death scenes here, though brutal in content, are so lacking in execution that the film's obviously toned-down rating becomes quite apparent here with this one really becoming ham-strung by keeping itself from really letting loose with its intentions. This one really could've used a little more gruesomeness in its kills, yet nothing of the sort happens here simply to keep the rating down, which is a pretty big factor here. Still, while these flaws are readily apparent throughout here the film does offer up some really chilling moments here, which consists almost mainly of it's supernatural hauntings from the times of its' interaction on the titular board. The early instances of the receptor moving by itself and flying around the room which makes for some chilling scenes, while the main action scenes of the group's encounters while playing with the object come off so well that there's a strong atmosphere throughout these scenes from seeing the ghosts interacting in the world around them only through the glass which is some really thrilling moments. Elsewhere, the finale here back in the house is a lot of fun with the attacks on the friends to trap them away in different sections of the house, the fateful game being played in the basement in front of the fireplace and the big ghost action throughout that sets up the grand resolution quite nicely. These are all fun and enjoyable with some thrilling action along the way to help it out, and does come up with some positives to counteract the flaws even though there's still some problematic areas.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",

            "content": "'Ouija' moderately drew me into seeing it, with a cool poster/cover, an intriguing if not particularly original premise and as someone with a general appreciation for horror. That it was low-budget, which from frequent personal experience is rarely a good sign due to that there are so many poor ones out there, made me though apprehensive as well as the low rating and poor reviews here. Yet another film seen recently unfortunately, hence some reiteration because the exact same strengths and flaws those films have are present here, that to me was incredibly disappointing considering its potential which it doesn't do anywhere near enough with. 'Ouija' is terrible, with a plethora of problems (huge ones too) and doesn't do enough with its potential, which was hardly small. There is really nothing to recommend other than Olivia Cooke trying her best and actually being pretty okay.Unfortunately, 'Ouija' is shot and edited so poorly, looking like a school project shot on a shaky camera or a phone by an unsteady hand, and the drab and overly-dark colours. It was very clear that the film was made in a rush with no care or enthusiasm. In particular, the camera work was a nauseous assault on the eyes with its excessive amateurish-ness and the lighting is far too dark and a lot of the time inappropriately so.Going on further to the negatives, the story does feel paper thin, disjointed and over-stretched and some of it feels vague, under-explained in the last third where the film especially became duller, more predictable, more senseless and less scary. Too many characters are too sketchy and with nowhere near enough to make one want to endear to them. Their annoying and illogical decision making and behaviours frustrates and are overdone.Making the film feel bland and forgettable with not enough heart put into it. The effects are ropy at best, the sound quality is obvious and utilised cheaply (being too loud in the build ups and people's reactions) and it's best not mentioning the elsewhere lumbering, awkward and histrionic acting that shows a huge indifference to the situation and what is going on.Dialogue can be stilted and rambling, with lots of clich\u00e9s, lots of unintentional humour and no depth whatsoever, while the pace goes to a standstill very quickly and drags on forever with very little going on worth caring about and useless padding, never recovering. Found too many the supposedly shocking moments not surprising or scary and the supposedly creepy atmosphere dreary, due to the excessive obviousness, a lot of dumb and vague moments and explanations and the lack of tension and suspense. Would not have minded the lack of originality (the film is extremely derivative and in a dumbed and watered down way) if the story and atmosphere were at least alright in execution, in reality they were both incredibly poorly done.A lot of 'Ouija' often nonsensical and confusing character motivations, while too many of the things to make you jump or shocked are far from creative or scary and are pretty tame. Most of those attempted in fact are very contrived and will make one roll the eyes than jump. The film often fails to make sense, is very by the numbers and there is no imagination.There is not enough threat, and what there is of it tends to be used poorly, it is completely unimaginative and more odd than creepy, completely failing to show any sense of horror or creativity. Everything here is neither creative, suspenseful or nail-biting and much of it absurd. Some badly sagging momentum too. The direction is leaden, with an all over the place visual style, and like their heart was not in it or ill at ease, with the non-existent chemistry between the characters and actors coming over as constantly random. This is very dreary and amateurish stuff that fails to be scary, interesting or easy to follow, with the deaths being un-creative, too easily foreseeable and lame in execution.In conclusion, very poorly done. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

It did not suck and it did not rock. *It was basically a mixture of Insidious and Final Destination.* The scares in the movie were typically those corny jump-scares, but I have to say, they weren't bad. (Or really that good, either.) The thing about PG-13 horror movies is that they aren't really that scary at all. This movie was alright, I wouldn't say scary, but it would be enough to scare a little kid because of the loud noises and scary images. The story is okay. It kind of gets better and worse and better and worse. In the beginning, the story is declining, getting worse and worse, because of all the clich\u00e9 and disappointing climaxes. Then, it sort of gets better... and then back down to really bad. Then, in the second half of the movie, it starts to get really, really, intense and actually good. When you think it's over, it isn't. But when it is over, you wouldn't think that was the end. The acting was.. okay? In the beginning the acting totally STANK! I mean, it was really fake. But it got better and better as the movie progressed. The main character, Laine (Olivia Cooke) did an okay job of acting. She was the type in the movie that was sort of dumb, but in the end turned out to be a bit clever. All the things in the movie that happen are mostly things that you'd expect to happen. The special effects really were disappointing, when the monster/entity (not revealing any more than that) is shown, WOW are the effects SO FAKE.Lastly, don't let reviews change your mind about a movie. They are simply opinions. Just because this movie has under average ratings doesn't mean that you will automatically think this movie will and always will stink. Don't always look at the negative sides of a movie. :) And also, be careful. On my trip for watching this movie, there was a young delinquent cracking jokes to his \"encouraging\" friends, disrupting the full experience, so I may have missed some good parts of the movie.",

The pace does not seem too slow or too fast and there aren't any long breaks between something scary happening.

I gave up on expecting character development in these type of horror movies long time ago but I was still waiting something in the sense of story telling which this movie has none of it.Quija heavily relies on one thing. Trying to scare people by off screen boo effects because it doesn't have a story to tell. A group of high school kids get a Ouija board and gather around a table to find out why their beloved friend hung herself. Of course, the answer is not that clear and soon after, whatever they communicated with, starts chasing the group.The main problem of this movie is relying on jump scares rather than making the movie itself scary with the ambiance, story and the situations characters are in like Insidious, The Conjuring, Anabelle etc. If your friend suddenly tried to scare you every five minutes, how would you feel? Or would you still be scared after an hour or rather become annoyed? I'll go with the latter and that's what happens with this movie.Considering the 5 million dollar budget, I wasn't expecting much but when you think that the first Paranormal Activity had a thirty thousand dollar budget, I bet this movie could have made a lot better than what it is now.Unfortunately, Ouija lacks tension, horror, likable characters and all the things that a good movie has. It's a bummer to see that we don't have a good scary movie on a Halloween weekend and certainly Ouija does not have the fun you are looking for.P.S: If you really want to get scared and are looking for a movie about Ouija boards, then you should check out the British scary movie \"Long Time Dead\". Although it was made more than 12 years ago, it is a lot more scarier, gory and more successful than this awful Ouija mess.",

I told them that I own an Ouija Board\u0099 and have never been able to get it to function. The funniest thing about this item is its history. They were called \"spirit boards\" and regarded as a harmless parlor game unrelated to the occult until American Spiritualist Church founder Pearl Curran popularized its use to speak to the dead. So in effect, a Christian church made them popular. In the past, I have spoken to several members of the Spiritualist Church and they seem to have no clue about the history of their church and the board. They still practice speaking with the dead but reject the board due to popular beliefs.Later in the mid 1960's, Parker Brothers took the trade name Ouija, which is French for yes and German for yes. They sold a few before the more popular horror movie \"The Exorcist\" came to the screen. After that event, churches and uninformed people began burning them and making up urban legends about the game board. So I find it ironic that a mere fictional movie caused all the hysteria and hype about this parlor game.Now as to the movie, the board itself was no more than a prop for this movie. Much like the VHS tape was for \"The Ring\". It was more about a mentally disturbed mother who tortured her daughter. The movie was basically a jump scare film and only one caught me off guard, but it didn't scare me. This week I have been watching some old 1980's horror movies like \"Hell Raiser\" now that is classic and very scary. They depend on old school effects and not computer generated ones. They used great makeup and well dress props besides having an original plots. I tried very hard to get my friends to stay at my house and watch some old classic horror movies on Netflix.

We should completely understand why this genre of film exists though. If you are making these types of films, likely there is a target market already in place for them. These movies don't work though because it's not like your going to have source material for them because the film is only about a game or a doll. One prime example of these problems occurs in the film Battleship. The film feels nothing liking the classic game Battleship due to the characters and plot elements. Whenever I play Battleship, it's not like I am introduced to characters or a plot. The source material of the game is not at all related to the movie elements. Ouija is the latest dip into this genre in 2014.Ouija is an infamous spirit board and it's purpose is to talk to the dead and it is self-explanatory why we see ouija boards only in horror films. Films like The Exorcist from 1973 or Paranormal Activity from 2009 are some examples of horror films with Ouija boards. Ouija boards have turned into an urban legend with supposed deaths occurring because of them and this is one reason why my girlfriend hates them with a passion. I am the first one to say that Ouija as it's own movie based off the board would be hard due to because you need a lot of material to support it but it is still an interesting idea none the less. As it turns out, Ouija is enough to get by but still nothing very promising.After Debbie Galardi (Shelley Hennig) commits suicide after finding a Ouija board in her room, a group of her closest friends come together to find the reason for her suicide though none of them know that the board itself might be the problem.As I said before, this is the type of plot that needs to rely on substance to survive because it is only based off a game board. The substance though here is average at best. Kill scenes we have all seen before, pacing that is all over the place and a low budget to the film as evidenced by it's lack of location and sets. Ouija is a film that is put together in a way that makes it come off as very unmemorable. The film's downfall can also go back to the characters. Casting teenagers in these PG-13 horror films is already the norm but in the end, there is really nothing here to see from the cast. There is no substance whatsoever to the characters and they are made in a way that makes you not like or dislike them. They are characters you just watch waiting for the ending. Even Lin Shaye shows up as Paulina Zander, a character that has an interesting backstory to film. This backstory though that feels like a last minute idea and comes into the film too late. The maid of the house played by Vivis Colombetti is quite underused and is a big waste of an idea and a character.Much like the film Mama from last year or other horror remakes, Ouija is a slumber party film for teenagers girls to get scared who do not know about good horror films yet or will never know. You could even say it is also a film meant to watch with your significant other because at theater for my showing, the place was filled with nothing but couples. Ouija is the type of horror film that I can choose to forgot and will certainly forgot about once I pick the best horror films from 2014.",

            "content": "Ouija takes the classic ritualistic game board and puts a modern horror spin on it...and cue the stereotypical sigh! Ouija is HORRIBLE. There's no other way to put it. From the direction, the screenplay, the acting, this is a hollow film that could have found an audience on Netflix rather than wasting a ton of money putting this in theaters. Following a group of friends, hollowly portrayed by every actor, they awaken an evil spirit via the infamous board game. This sounds like a cool concept but the fact remains that most cool concepts almost always have a shoddy film to accompany it. This is no exception. It is slow, painfully boring, not scary and ridiculous especially in its preposterous third act. This is one of those films that could have had the potential to be an extremely unnerving film but instead, it relies on clich\u00e9 scares and cheap acting for us to try and grasp, only to realize after the first of many cheap scares this is nothing like The Conjuring, Dead Silence, or The Ring. This is more on par with The Ring 2 and The Grudge. There is simply no point to it all which makes the scares less and less scary and more and more funny as it goes on. Overall, there isn't much more to say about this film without becoming redundant. Its a horribly acted, terribly written, and atrociously directed film that I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. Yes, Ouija is THAT bad.",

            "content": "Okay you know Hollywood is getting desperate when they are scraping into the board game barrel for a movie idea. Tonight's review is on the latest horror story that involves another trip down the spirit communicating pathway. I'm talking about the movie Ouija, which from the trailers looked to be another simplistic scare story designed to make you fear the dark. Can this movie compete with the recently released Annabelle, or is it just another brick in the wall of moderately decent horror films. I've never known Ouija to be a popular board game, but this isn't the first time the simplistic board game has been put into a movie. Ouija seems to be remake of the films proceeding it, taking certain aspects of it's predecessors and recycling them into one 90 minute mess. What do we get? The answer is a plot that has been pretty much told by the trailers, where one person dies playing the game, leading to her friends trying to uncover the \"mystery\" at hand. Ouija's story is relatively straight and narrow that spends little time on developing any of the characters. Like most horror stories, there is a spiritual entity that has it out for the living,, the reason for it's vengeance also often predictable. In this tale, they have attempted to put a little surprise in the works, but don't be too hopeful, you can easily pick up on it before the big revelation. Despite the little surprise, Ouija starts a lot of things that it doesn't tie up, which left me confused, disappointed, and rather annoyed. The motive for the spirit's hauntings are ambiguous and vague, leading to an ending that left me wanting more movie to get a more complete picture. Putting the shallow story on the side, let's talk about the scares this movie has. For this reviewer there was little scary about the movie. Most of the jump out moments you can see coming a mile away, and the only thing that really scares you is the sudden blaring of music. Sure a few of the screams and creature designs are creepy, but once revealed the effect diminishes within seconds. As for creepiness, the setting is the justifying factor here, with the hidden dangers of the dark smothering you for most of the movie. Those afraid of the dark, or being alone for that matter are going to get a little freaked out. Unfortunately, the ridiculous choices and the lack of common sense take away from the little there is in this movie and makes it more funny than scary. The dramatic build up of scares is very unfulfilling at points, with strange occurrences happening for a few seconds and then nothing. Even the kills in this movie lacked edge, many of which were cheesy and done with in manner of seconds. You heard me seconds, and the problem is that for the most part they are all happening the same way. Such mainstream, dull death gets boring after a while. In addition everything becomes rushed near the end of the movie, diminishing the thrills for a rather hasty conclusion. Oh well at least it's only 90 minutes of our lives right?Perhaps the last thing to discuss about this movie is the actors. Well the biggest strength is that they are all pretty. I like to call this the SyFy syndrome, where the casting grabs the hottest people they can find to give us eye candy. Maybe it's an attempt to distract reviewers from the failings of this movie, or maybe it's a way to give us sweet justice by seeing hot, rich people, fall. Either way your eyes are treated to their beauty, but outside of that there isn't much. They are not bad actors, after all they know how to look and act scared. It's just that there is nothing spectacular about this performance, and it's merely a movie one could have watched on T.V. and been just fine. The exception would be Lin Shaye, who once again dives into the role of a woman bordering on the line of sanity from the horrors she has seen. Shaye's role is very small, but her talents maximize the little screen time she has. Be assured that there will be no Oscars handed out for the performances in this movie, but these stars have great potential for future movies so long as they get better characters. Ouija is not the Halloween hit you might be looking for this season. A rather bland story, scares that fall short, and a rather monochromic cast leads to a recipe for disaster. The movie had potential I think, but there wasn't enough done to really make me terrified at the tale at hand. If you are dying for a Halloween film, I suggest you turn to the Book of Life, or revisit a classic horror film instead. I honestly cannot recommend seeing this film in theaters though. My scores for Ouija are:Horror: 4 Movie Overall: 3.5-4.0",

For such a big production, the writing is often hilarious (for all the wrong reasons) and at times just plain awful - but then again this comes from the same guy who penned the forgettable Boogeyman film and The Knowing starring Ridiculous Cage!The same guy directs, with this being his directorial debut, and as a director of 7 indie features myself, I often wonder how these guys get such a break - then deliver a sub-par film.To be honest, there really is nothing new here at all in regards to horror so I would say skip this and go straight to its prequel, Ouija: Origin of Evil, for a better film!!Ironically, Ouija lacks any spirit...",

Then it took me a while to figure out what kind of film am I watching. But I kind of liked it.In general it's quite an average film. There's nothing extraordinary in acting or directing or any field. But it's decent, and the lead actress is good. What I also liked is the overall pace and style. It's not a gimmicky marathon of jump scares. There's not even that much graphic horror. But the overall atmosphere works. The movie also avoids many cliches and annoyances in this genre. So, the best way to describe the movie is that --it's not annoying--. Even though the characters are teenagers, they aren't the typical annoying brats who you wait to die. Well, maybe still not very memorable characters, but it's a lot that they're not terrible.The negative aspect is that the story is quite typical and nothing special. Every now and then something interesting happens that nails my attention back to the screen, and there are a couple of good twists that I didn't expect. I'm afraid the story has some plot holes but I'm not really interested in thinking it more than this.Overall it's a movie that didn't bore me but when it was over I felt quite indifferent. But I don't get the trend of really negative reviews. I think it's massively better than \"Paranormal Activity\", perhaps a little bit better than \"The Grudge\", but in general still a little bit too average to be really memorable. Recommended for those who like slowly paced ghost films and drama-horror with emphasis on subtle tension and atmosphere.",

            "content": "Michael Bay must own stock in Hasbro. Remember, he is the sensationally successful producer & director of the fabulously profitable \"Transformers\" franchise. Now, he serves as producer of the shallow scary saga \"Ouija,\" a hopelessly predictable movie about the venerable game that Hasbro sells. Indeed, freshman film director and co-writer Stiles White conjures up just enough atmosphere to make your skin shrivel, but then blows it with stereotypical characters who deserve to be in a \"Scary Movie\" outing. This hysterically funny but straight-faced chiller borrows shamelessly from far better movies like \"The Conjuring,\" \"Paranormal Activity,\" and \"Insidious.\" At one point in this generic half-baked hokum, a female character delivers the immortal line: \"Calm down, it's only a game.\" Actually, what she should have said is \"it's only lame.\" Every horror melodrama struggles to exploit something commonplace so it appears creepy, and \"Ouija\" succeeds in this respect. We're told an evil mother stitched her darling daughter's face up and her ghost haunts the attic of the house where our poor heroine resides. Several victims here wind up suffering the same fate as the daughter when they floss their teeth. No sooner have they begun to floss than the floss turns into twine cross stitching their lips. Oh, yes, their eyes turn cloudy, too. Nothing is remotely scary about \"Ouija,\" but some moments will make you shrink in disgust: a cadaverously pale-faced, Gollum like gal scuttles through a shadowy attic and attacks our heroine. The rest of the time this lackluster thriller presents a group of hare-brained teens trying to contact one of their own who hanged herself in the house when she learned that she couldn't incinerate her Ouija board. Naturally, the dead teen's friends break out the old \"Ouija\" board, turn down the lights, slap their fingers on the planchette, and watch where it takes them. Afterward, all you've got to do is take the planchette and squint through the magnifying glass lens, and you can spot a denizen from the spirit world. Stiles relies on quick cuts, loud music, and either people or objects suddenly entering the frame to frighten you. I haven't seen a horror movie this bad in a long time, and I felt like I'd squandered 90 minutes of my life. Save your money; get a flashlight and a mirror, and sit in the dark and scare yourself before you see this schlock for Halloween.",

            "content": "\"Ouija\" is an American 90-minute movie from 2014, so this one has its second anniversary this year. It got some attention recently again as they made a sequel to it. The impact of writer and director Stiles White in this sequel was not as big though, he was the man in charge of this first film we got here. And this one was not really an inspired or creative achievement. It felt like done pretty much by the formula without including any features that make it stand out from the mass of mediocre horror movies. We have a hot girl as the main character, her equally hot female friends and some guy characters who are not strong enough though to stand up to the evil spirit that gets everybody's life in danger and kills some characters from the gang too. But the tiny girl manages to succeed eventually because of her courage, dedication and determination. Been there, seen that.This film is about an Ouija board and this is a subject that was also dealt with many times already in films, so everybody probably roughly knows what to expect here. Some of the Ouija board scenes are pretty cringeworthy, others are solid. When they find out that they have not been talking to their dead friends is one of the best moments of the film, but also one of very few good moments actually. The confrontation at the very end with the evil spirit is not a highlight at all and makes the film seem even more forgettable than it has been in the previous 80 minutes. Judging from this one here, I cannot see why there is any need for a sequel really, but looking at how critics kinda liked this new film and that it was also made by other people than who made this first film, maybe I am a bit too harsh here. I can only judge this one we have here and I am not impressed at all. It was never really scary and this is the main objective for a horror film. Maybe you will be scared if you watch this in a dark theater at night on a huge screen, but otherwise I don't think it is a rewarding watch whatsoever. Acting and script were also fairly mediocre at best. I give it a thumbs-down. Watch something else instead.",

Basically childhood friends Laine Morris (Afra Sophia Tully) and Debbie Galardi (Claire Beale) used to play with an Ouija board, now in the present day, Laine (Olivia Cooke) throws the board in the fire, burning it. However, the board reappears in Debbie's room, she is possessed and hangs herself, Laine and her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), younger sister Sarah (Ana Coto), friend Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos), and Debbie's boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith) attend her funeral. After the wake, the five friends find the Ouija board, Laine suggests using it communicate with Debbie's spirit, strange things happen during their session, including Pete smashing his head into the mirror. Soon after, the friends start finding the phrase \"hi friend\" (a message communicated during the Ouija board session) written in various places, including in a car window, on a tunnel wall, on a desk and on Laine's computer. Thinking it is Debbie communicating with them, they have another board session, but they realise they have actually come into contact with another spirit of the house. Laine looks through the board's planchette and sees the image of a little girl with her mouth sewn shut, the girl warns her mother is coming, then she sees an old woman, and the group flee. Laine later learns that Debbie found the Ouija board in her attic and played with it alone, then Isabelle is possessed and killed, she smashes her head and cracks her skull open on the bathroom sink. Laine and Pete decide to investigate the house, in the attic they finds photographs belonging to the previous residents, and searching the family history, they find out the little girl, Doris (Sunny May Allison) went missing, her mother was suspected of the disappearance. Laine finds Doris's now elderly sister, Paulina (Insidious's Lin Shaye), committed to a psychiatric hospital, she explains that her mother was a medium, and used Doris's as a vessel for the dead to speak through, the mother went mad, stitched up Doris's mouth, and killed herself. Paulina tells Laine about a secret room in the house, where she must find Doris's hidden body and unstitch her mouth in order to banish the mother. The remaining friends return to the Galardi house, Laine finds the corpse and cuts the mouth stitches, Doris's spirit appears to chase the ghost of the mother away, but shortly after, Pete is possessed and is killed at home, appearing as a ghost with his mouthy sewn shut. Returning to Paulina, Laine realises the old woman intentionally lied, Doris is actually the evil entity, the mother was trying to stop the friends summoning her with the board. The Morris's grandmother, Nona (Vivis Colombetti), advises the sisters destroy Doris's body and the Ouija board at the same time, Trevor is then killed, being possessed and thrown into the swimming pool, filled with plastic wrapping, he is trapped and drowns. Laine and Sarah return to the Galardi house cellar, Sarah is captured by Doris and prepares to sew her mouth shut, but the spirit's attention is drawn by Laine playing with the Ouija board. Doris attempts to possess her, but Debbie's spirit appears, helps save Laine and defeat Doris, her body is thrown into the furnace, and Laine throws the Ouija board. The paranormal activity is over, but in her bedroom, Laine finds the planchette has mysteriously appeared, she looks through its glass hole, the picture fades to black, it is unclear if she saw anything. Also starring Matthew Settle as Mr. Morris, Robyn Lively as Mrs. Galardi, Claudia Katz Minnick as Mother and Morgan Peter Brown as Young Sarah. Everyone has tried having a seance in some way at some point, for fun or for reason, this film is based on the Hasbro \"talking board\" idea, unfortunately it is full of flaws, the contrived shocks are minimal, there is little gore and imagination with the deaths, and the story is predictable, that popular seance question \"is anybody there?\" could easily be aimed at the audience, let's hope the prequel is better, a pretty boring supernatural horror.

It is the first Hasbro property adaptation produced by Platinum Dunes and Blumhouse Productions, as well as Hasbro's first horror film.The film opens with a young Laine Morris and Debbie Galardi playing with a Ouija board in Laine's room, only to be interrupted by Laine's sister Sarah. The scene then forwards to present day, where Debbie (Shelley Hennig) is playing with the board by herself and is so unnerved by what she experiences that she tries to burn the board and planchette before calling Laine (Olivia Cooke). Concerned, Laine comes over but is sent away by Debbie, who goes upstairs only to find the board on her bed. Her eyes turn white and she hangs herself. The following day, Laine is with her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff) at a diner, where they meet up with their friend Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos). Laine receives a text and goes home, learning of Debbie's death. After the funeral, Laine finds Debbie's Ouija board and decides to gather Sarah, Trevor, Isabelle, and Debbie's boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith) to hold a seance. They make contact with someone who is identified as D, who Laine immediately believes is Debbie. Despite this, the group is too frightened to continue playing. A couple nights later, they're drawn back to the board after each person finds the message \"hi friend\" in various locations. Upon further interaction with the board, the group discovers that the spirit is not Debbie. Laine looks through the planchette and sees a young girl with her mouth stitched closed, who then warns the group to run from her mother. The group heads home, only for a malicious spirit to follow Isabelle and murder her. Trevor and Laine research Debbie's house and find that a young girl was placed in a mental institution after killing her mother, who she claims killed her sister, Doris. The two travel to the institution and meet Paulina Zander, who states that their mother killed Doris and sewed her mouth shut because she believed that spirits were trying to communicate through her. Trevor and Laine head home and unleash the spirits of Doris and Mrs. Zander. Doris overcomes her mother and the group believes that everything has been resolved. Unfortunately, this is not true as Pete is later killed by Doris. Laine confronts Paulina about this, only to realize that Doris and Paulina were the evil ones and that Mrs. Zander was trying to stop them. Laine's grandmother tells them that the only way to stop the ghost is to burn Doris's body and the Ouija board. Trevor is also killed before Sarah manages to locate the corpse. Both Sarah and Laine are attacked by Doris and it is only through the intervention of Debbie's spirit that the girls survive and manage to burn Doris's corpse and the Ouija board, destroying Doris. The two sisters return home, only for Laine to find the planchette waiting for her in her room.See This Top Movie With Your Family!. Pity It Is So Under-rated!",

Zero black people?! I wonder why? Black people wouldnt have played the game. In the first scene, the girl turns OFF all the lights and goes UP stairs not out the door! Lol. Black people wouldve run so far away if a door opened and stove turned on. White people in scary movies go TOWARD danger. It's funny and dumb. The movie had potential but the casting was bad.",

From here it just gets worse, as we have to sit through these worthless characters systematically getting picked off, one by one; but not in any cool \"Final Destination\" way, but in the dullest, least terrifying way imaginable. And then! To top it all off, when it is revealed what is actually behind the murders and the motives, things becomes so oddly confusing, that I felt stupid for trying to follow it. Final Thought: \"Ouija\" has a cameo from that old lady from \"Insidious\"(Lin Shaye) and she sells it for the two scenes she's in. Also, there is one scary scene near the end, which involves a \"monster\" climbing through a vent, which is in fact shockingly well filmed by first time \"director\", Stiles White.

The fact that Ouija boards grew out to become symbol for the macabre, spiritualism and horror is pretty good marketing, if you ask me! As made clear by the title, a Ouija board also forms the central gimmick in this film, but like all skeptical horror fans know, a good gimmick doesn't necessarily guarantee a good movie! \"Ouija\" is an incredibly uninspired, lame and overly sentimental PG13 ghost story that too obviously steals its plot ideas from other films. This could easily be a sequel in the \"Insidious\" franchise, except that the Ouija board replaces the human spiritual medium (but Lin Shaye is still present), while the death sequences could come straight out of a \"Final Destination\" sequel (notably the freak accident in the bathroom). After fooling around with a Ouija board she found in the attic, a teenage girl inexplicable commits suicide. Her friends, and particularly her BFF Layne, refuse to accept that a vivid and joyful young girl like Debbie played with the idea of ending her own life, so they gather around to seek contact with their friend via the same Ouija board. They quickly discover the board is connected to an unresolved missing girl case from the 1950s and put their own lives at risk by unleashing malevolent souls. \"Ouija\" is a strictly by-the-numbers and commercial horror effort, with predictable boo-moments and fake scares at the most foreseeable moments. The teen protagonists are admittedly less stereotypical and annoying than usually the case in this sort of films, but still you don't feel too much empathy for them. The lead girl, Olivia Cooke, is cute and she surely can act, but she's probably also smart enough to realize that her role in the series \"Bates Motel\" is a more valuable addition on her resume. There isn't any gore (duh, PG13) and the make-up effects are weak. My 8-year-old son walked in during one of the supposedly scariest moments, but he wasn't the least bit upset.",

One thing we hear loud and clear is \"never play alone.\"In present time we see Shelley Hennig (of Destrehan, Louisiana) as her friend Debbie Galardi, finding the board in the attic of an old house, and playing alone. Then we learn that she is dead, she seems to have hanger herself. Or did she?The story moves along from there, we see then looking up old newspaper accounts, a mother and her two daughters once lived in that house, the daughter killed the mother back in the 1950s. They believe they still haunt the house.This movie has suitably scary moments if you have a good sound system, and especially if you have a powered subwoofer. On TV or computer speakers, probably not so much. The deep bass makes a real difference in this kind of soundtrack. Not a top-notch movie but a suitably entertaining diversion. DVD from my public library.SPOILERS: The dead mother had been mean to her daughters, even sewing up the mouth of the one she killed. Then the daughter who killed the mom is still living, in an institution. Laine meets her and is told to find a secret room in the basement, find the child's body, and cut the strings over her mouth as the way to free the spirits and dispatch them. They do, in a fairly exciting scene near the end. Plus they thrown the Ouija board into the furnace, along with the remains of the long dead girl.",

This movie is NOT the case!Ouija board is one of the most common props for horror films, so it's only natural that a movie after which is named is centered around a Ouija case. However, although I don't know who really wrote this film, I can honestly say as a viewer, that this could be written by ANYONE! The plot is so appallingly clich\u00e9d and shallow, it would mostly make a Supernatural episode---a mid-season filler, not even one of the better. There is zero creativity in this movie. What's worse? You don't sense any effort, either. How a script so simple could be green-lighted for a feature film is beyond me. I can only assume it's a quick money-grabber to be released on Halloween. And I heard it worked pretty well commercially.None of the other aspects of the film made any attempts to make this movie, if not a good motion picture, but at least an entertaining experience. As we know, bad films can be equally fun to watch, which is especially true in the horror genre. But, again, not this one. The acting is bad, even by horror standards. Character development, well, not bad, BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY! So far, my comments can also apply to another 2014 horror film, Anabelle. But that film excelled, at least, in creating an intense atmosphere, great sound effects and some really good scares, even if many are plain shameless jump scares. Ouija, sadly, fails at delivering even the faintest idea of fright, which is the basic idea of horror films. Not even the jump scares are scary here. How the hell do you fail jump scares? Any dude with a hand-held camera can shoot jump scares!!So my conclusion of this film is...exactly the title I employed. There are no redeeming factors. I can't imagine any group of filmwatcher to find this entertaining. Not that my opinion counts for much, but don't even waste your money to rent this.",

Guy gets pushed from behind so hard into a mirror that it shatters, but when asked what happened, he's not even shaken up, that was some of the worst acting I've ever seen.2. I like the little penguin, I'm not sure really what he represents except perhaps the superstitious nature of the main character's mind, and susceptibility to fear driven perceptions, curiosities about the unknown.3. The one white and one black sock on the stairs, yin yang, balance, dark and light... grandma picks up the socks and is the one living in ignorant fear of the board, which I think creates a splintered and unempowered slave mentality, a very real one, because people truly are that way when it comes to Ouija boards. She is also the one who seems to understand the board most, so the socks could represent her grasp on these energies of light and dark. 4. Apparently saying goodbye doesn't have the desired affect.5. The planchette, I liked the idea of the viewfinder, very Conjuring... the speaking the words together reminded me of the movie \"Stay Alive\" which was decent.6. This movie doesn't develop or pace well... the guy looks up an article and its the first thing he looks at, this doesn't help to pull me into the movie... a movie that does the investigation thing better is The Ring by Verbinski.7. Oversaturation of Lin Shaye in today's paranormal horror films... she's in every single one and it's just too much. 8. Spirits without bodies moving through a physical space and touching/abusing people or things is hard to believe... unexplained phenomenon have always eventually led to a logical overlooked explanation out of fear. I know I know, it's just a movie... 9. This movie was profoundly simplistic, and then there's the scene 1 hour and 10 minutes in when the scene shows off the girls boobs in the red dress, I guess that's the boobs in horror they are obligated to give audiences, eh?After that the movie gets even sillier with ghosts shouting possession at people... I mean come on! I wanted to like this movie and you just keep making it harder to do.10. \"You weren't supposed to free her\"... another similarity to The Ring, but one I enjoyed. I like that twist. I wouldn't say the movie is horrible, if I were 12 years old I bet it'd be really scary, but it doesn't offer too much for a deeply thinking, experienced mind. I think there's a great Ouija board movie out there waiting to be made, but we haven't seen it yet.Mediocre film, with a mediocre ending.",

Well, hell to those who say that because this is defiantly one of my new favorite modern scary movies.I gotta say, though, I really wanted to give this a 10/10, but there were a few things that bugged me. One was that in the trailer Sarah (played by Ana Coto) was seen saying \"It's not even real, okay. It's just a game,\" while her voice gets all demonic and her eyes go white. Well, that didn't happen. Well, it did but it didn't. She said something like that but her voice wasn't demonic nor did her eyes go white. Not to mention the countless other things that happened in the trailer but didn't in the movie. (but the thing with Sarah that was so memorable for me personally not being in the movie made me mad for a bit)And that wasn't the only thing that bugged me. The movie left off at a weird spot that makes it need to have a part two. And, if you ask me, the parts that we saw in the trailer that weren't actually in the movie will probably be in part two. (because they need to make one)Now, what if you want to see it but you don't know if it's \"your style\"? Well, let me break this down. If you're the type who loves jump-scares, you'll like this movie. It's packed full of them. You'll even jump at things that you never thought you'd jump at or things that aren't really a threat. If you're the type of person who likes a lot of gore and morbidness, this movie isn't really for you. Sure, this has some morbid parts here and there, especially with the killing of the characters and the design of the antagonist(s(?)), but nothing like a slasher-killer movie. And, if you like movies where you'll have people yelling at how stupid the characters can be *cough**cough*Every Scary Movie Ever*cough**cough* then you'll defiantly like this movie. And, I gotta say, despite it's faults, I love this movie, I'm glad I saw it in thee theater, and I would love to spend my money on it again.Now, if you excuse me, I need to go make plans to see this again.",

            "content": "Ouija, as a film and a concept, embodies why the mainstream horror genre finds itself in such a lackluster position in current times. For one, any remaining originality left in an idea is compromised by writing that not only devotes more to jumpscares. Any shred of suspense or mounting dread is compromised by the screenwriter's and cinematographer's desire to get to the loud, immediate jolt in the music or synthesizers so an impulsive reaction can be contained from the audience. As a result, much like the scare, the audience is given an experience they are unlikely to remember very vividly following the credits.Secondly, there's the element of soiling a material's potential impact by giving it a PG-13 rating. Immediately, veteran movie- lovers and horror fans take note of this stamp as something that caters to the teen demographic, as middle schoolers and high schoolers can now attend the film without a parent or adult guardian. Because this market is included, we can already expect a relatively tame affair that doesn't illicit half of the idea's real potential, and if we consider that this particular idea's potential involves bringing the dead back to life and other demonic occurrences, we can see that quite a lofty amount of potential is sacrificed thanks to this rating.And, finally, there's just the question of the film's existence. Is there a need for another film focusing on several twentysomethings messing around only for them to experience their ugly fate one by one, in a fashion that is unoriginal and without suspense? Certain films of the genre, admittedly, put a creative twist on the subject matter: The Cabin in the Woods offered a mind-bending, subversive quality to well-worn material, Cabin Fever gave us superb woodsy cinematography to look at while giving us delightful practical effects, and even the recent remake of The Town That Dreaded Sundown provided for a pleasant, meta angle to something that could've been a rote, unsatisfying retelling quite easily. Ouija offers no element of creativity in the slightest. It lies dead in the water, providing us with what we expect in depressingly mediocre amounts and giving us a plethora of poorly-drawn, empty teenage vessels (not characters) to spew such perfunctory dialog as \"I think we should stop playing\" and \"Just leave the stupid game alone.\" We, the audience, sit at the mercy of a film only eighty- four minutes in length, asking ourselves if there was some way the board in which the teens play on can emancipate us from the confines of shallow storytelling and completely vapid individuals. Alas, such optimism is foolish and cutesy, as the film persists on in a murky, uninteresting fashion, leaving all hope for any remnant of thought or originality to be almost entirely lost.Even the weaker, less compelling horror films ordinarily include some sort of intriguing element: perhaps the cinematography looks nice, the music is on-point quite frequently, or one or more of the characters is compelling in some way. Ouija is the rare case where it may as well be the cinematic personification of a flat soda left out in the sun in which all of its qualities are thrown into an indistinct pot where they are all muted beyond any form of recognition. I've come a personal ethical quibble with myself on whether or not I should award it points as film for doing that so shockingly, but, if this review hasn't proved it already, I'm getting ahead of myself.Starring: Douglas Smith, Ana Coto, Olivia Cooke, Daren Kagasoff and Bianca Santos.

            "content": "We've all heard the stories about Ouija boards from the internet and urban legends journals and we've probably wondered are they true or just bunk? Naturally, Hollywood has done more than its fair share of building upon these tales by featuring Ouija boards in everything from the horror classic \"The Exorcist\" to 80's fun \"Witchboard\". The latest attempt of this subject by Hollywood is 2014's \"Ouija\". The film centers around a group of teens in mourning after one of their friends seemingly commits suicide, keyword: seemingly. One of their the teens, Laine (Olivia Cook), convinces her friends to investigate things further after they find an Ouija board in their friend's room. Needless to say, they get far more than they bargained for when they come in contact with a dark spirit with evil intentions and are pitted in a battle of life and death. Can they win or they doomed to join their friend on the other side?First let's start with the good. The filmmakers do manage to incorporate a little creepiness in the film's atmosphere by creating a feeling of menace throughout the story as well as a few good, high adrenaline scares here and there. As for performances, in my opinion most of the actors do a fairly decent job in their roles as average teens fooling around with something they shouldn't. Olivia Cook plays the part of the foolishly curious Laine well, as does Ana Coto as her sister, Daren Kagasoff as Trevor, Blanca A. Santos as Isabelle, Douglas Smith as Pete, or Sunny May Allison as Doris. Now the bad: There's not a whole lot we haven't seen before and we get the sense that the film's overall scare factor is watered down. Watching the film, I felt it could have been so much more if the filmmakers had gone a little further in developing the scares and creepiness of the film. Instead, they probably didn't want to make it too scary for the tween and teen crowd, which I can understand up to a point. Bottom line, if you want a popcorn movie to watch with a couple of your friends one night, \"Ouija\" is not the worst way to do it. Just don't expect it to give you nightmares like \"The Exorcist\" or the more recent \"The Conjuring\".",

The Acting overall was really good and don't let the rating PG-13 fool you, don't judge a book by its cover. Ouija is one creepy scary movie, that would have you jumping out of your seats.

            "content": "PG13 isn't the end of the world for Horror Films. It can be done. But you've got to have a great story and a really good eye behind the camera to get under your skin and use the story and characters to get to you. Ouija has no gore, a few good creepy scenes, but this is something we've seen a dozen times before. There is nothing new here and it just feels like it goes on and on and by the time it wraps up you're just done with the entire idea. The acting is okay and the characters are okay but very vapid with very little development. It is definitely a \"teen\" horror and there isn't anything wrong with that per se but they really don't try to impress. I feel like this was made for a quick cash grab and it was successful at that. It is just a very simple thriller.Olivia Cooke is our scream queen and she's okay given how little she is given to work with. I think she has the right look and I enjoy her on Bates Motel so she could be great but this script gave her little to nothing to go on and the character is so typical that they don't even try to develop the rehashed material. Her friends and fodder for the horror film are so random and barely noticeable that its almost sad for any young actor to be in this. They might be fine actors or might be terrible but Ouija should not be a reflection of them. Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Bianco Santos, Douglas Smith and Shelley Hennig are completely forgettable characters with no depth whatsoever. Somehow they do manage to have chemistry together, they are believable as a close knit group of friends but it doesn't really help anything along. Douglas Smith might be the one small exception as he actually shows some emotional depth with his character as much as he can. Sierra Heuermann is okay as the girl who mysteriously dies. She doesn't get a lot of scenes but she's decent in the few she's in. Go to PG Horror Queen Lin Shaye (who I love) also makes a forced appearance. I say forced because she's cast simply because she made the amazing Insidious so good...Insidious revolutionized the PG13 horror and proved beyond a doubt that you could scare and do it without blood soaking and gratuitous nudity but Ouija tries to ride those coat tails with very little success.Ultimately I don't feel there was any real effort put into this film. They had a script, they knew they could do it on a shoestring and they did and it turned a profit so good for them. But this is far from anything that I would say was \"good\" let alone \"great.\" It was just mildly entertaining...more of a brainless distraction...and everything about it reeks of copying other material and not even copying it well. It doesn't even remotely surprise me that first time director who also co-wrote the screenplay has little experience. They have done special effects before and worked on some great movies but this proves that those talents don't always transition to film maker. Or rather the studio just didn't care and told them to slap something together. At least Ouija doesn't \"look\" cheap so I'll give them that. Its a mainstream film that aims squarely at squealing teenagers at a sleepover. Any horror fan or even thriller fan will find yourself yawning all the way through. Skip it. 5/10",

            "content": "I missed this one at the cinema and I'm glad I did. The main character Laine is so flat and utterly unlikeable, and not particularly well-portrayed. It's impossible to feel anything but contempt for her, as she annoys her friends and sister and puts everyone in danger for her inane impulses. It would be different if the character were a strongly-written and robustly-portrayed one, but as the focal protagonist, it causes the film to fall apart around her. It's not solely the actress's fault, but she nonetheless does a poor job; there was some material there for her to work with, which she failed to do.The story is just poor all around, though. Not only is it boring, but it doesn't really feel compelling at all. It's difficult to care about any of the characters, and while some of the acting may be poor, it's more a fault of the flaccid script. It's shot like a typical teen drama, but there isn't even the exaggerated angst and nonsense to give at least some laughable amusement, since it's really trying to be a horror movie.It's just not good. The characters and setting don't draw the viewer in, and ultimately it's hard to care with such bland characters and poor portrayals, especially on the part of Laine. A \"talking board\" story could be interesting, even gripping or scary...just not here. Part of what is required for that is for the main character not to be an insufferable ass, and that's true in most horror. If the viewer doesn't care if the character lives or dies or, even worse, actively wishes they'd buy the farm, then the film has failed in its chosen genre.Ouija definitely fails on every respect. It's not even worth B-movie classification. The only good part about it is Robyn Lively, and she's in the movie for about two minutes total. Just watch a better movie: Teen Witch, starring Robyn. At least it'll make you smile because it actually tries and she has real charisma, unlike anyone in Ouija.",

            "content": "'OUIJA': Two Stars (Out of Five)Hasbro's first horror flick is this supernatural thriller based on their popular board game; which has been used as a 'spirit board', since the late 1800s, by people mockingly, or seriously, trying to communicate with the dead. The film tells the story of a group of friends that investigate the shocking death of another friend, after she was recorded using an ancient Oija board. The movie was written and directed by first time feature film director Stiles White and written by White and Juliet Snowden (the duo also co-wrote the 2012 supernatural horror flick 'THE POSSESSION'). It stars Olivia Cooke, Shelley Hennig, Daren Kagasoff, Douglas Smith, Ana Coto, Bianca A. Santos and Lin Shaye. I found the movie to be pretty boring and really, somewhat painfully, dry. Laine (Cooke) and Debbie (Hennig) had been friends since they were little girls; they also experimented with a Oija board, playfully, when they were young. When Debbie is found dead at her house, presumably having hung herself, Laine, and four other friends, investigate what happened to her. They find a video recording of Debbie playing with a really old Oija board and also find the 'spirit board' itself. They then try to use the board to summon the dead, themselves, and find out what happened to Debbie. This of course turns out to be a grave mistake. The movie does have some creepy imagery, and a few good scares, but other than that it's just a complete waste of time. It's so dull it sometimes makes it's 89 minute running time seem like it's hours longer (at least). The acting and directing are really amateurish and the script could have used about a dozen more rewrites. I like and respect horror movies, even the bad ones, but this one isn't even bad in a fun way; it's just boring.

            "content": "They probably only waited 30 years to make this movie since it would probably have been too close to the superior Witchboard. But, still Ouija definitely belongs in the 1980s.Or, it's an homage. Because this movie, step by step, is a 1980s ghost story. Every \"fright,\" twist or solution stemmed from countless movies before it. I will admit to one\u0085ONE\u0085tiny jump scare that I unwillingly participated in, but that was just one tiny shot out of the dozen failed attempts from the movie.Don't get me wrong; I didn't hate this movie. Sure, I wasn't scared in this \"horror\" story, or even involved in any of the characters, stories, subplots or even who lived or died. What I kinda did like was bringing back good memories of when I loved horror \u2013 between the 1970s and 1990s. Ever since then, I cannot name more than maybe five horror movies I truly liked. Lately, it's been 90% or more ghost stories, and I really cannot stand haunted movies.Yes, this is one, too, and yeah, I didn't really like this one much either. Man, I miss slasher movies, or even ones that dealt with physics. But, I'll get to that later.The enormously simple synopsis includes two lifelong BFFs who used to play on a Ouija board as kids, but only one of them broke the rules and played on her own later in life. Suddenly, one-by-one of the small group of friends and relatives are picked off. Sound familiar?All of this should. I am sincerely hoping they were going for homage to the classics of decades past and not simply ripping them all off 30 years too late. Because, if it's the latter, then, again, all of this should be familiar and that can lead to a boring movie since we've seen all of this before.But, heck, it's under an hour and a half, so at least it has that going for it. My recommendation is: If you believe this (in the first 15 minutes of watching it) as homage, carry on. If not, and you think they literally had no shame in stealing, stop and return to Redbox, or stop streaming it, or for the love of all that is living, stop watching it through that little glass circle!* * *Final thoughts: I really, really don't like ghost/haunted house stories. For the most part, they make me crack up; they seriously make me laugh out loud at their silliness. I seem to be in the minority as a ton of my friends and people I've met over my years actually believe in possession, spirits, pictures floating around the room with no explanation. And\u0085that's just it for me. I believe in physics, in real matter. If, what I see on screen isn't what I think could really happen in life, I am not just unafraid, but I think it's humorous. Especially since these ghost stories seem to just make up rules as they go along. I mean, if writing was that simple, I would totally make my love story's main character 45 minutes in suddenly have the ability to fly. Wouldn't that be cool if I could just throw whatever BS at the screen and people will buy it, or at least the people who believe the ghost- nonsense. I digress. I do love horror, and probably my favorite subgenre is the slasher. To name one horror icon I loved growing up was Jason Voorhees. Basically, and for the majority of his movies, he scared me. All I had to do was remove the \"Return from the grave\" opening and play along with the psycho killer in the woods theme. I could turn it in my head as \"this could really happen\" and I would be scared. Turning it back to this movie, Ouija, since I 100% do not believe in ghosts, there is nothing that would ever scare me in these dominating ghost stories as of late.And don't even get me started on the countless, exactly the same and completely hilarious \"Based on True Events\" ghost stories\u0085Those are the absolute funniest.",

Maybe it's just that I expected a lot more from it; especially as it had such great advertising and publicity, however this was a snooze-fest start to end. Even the acting was flat and I cared nothing for any of the characters involved. I definitely have seen worse in terms of budget, concept, etc. but at least they had a certain quirk or charm to them that made them different. In short, it felt like I had already seen this film 1,000 times before. Unfortunately this one happened to be the most boring film I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through.",

            "content": "The call to the other side is a connection that people have claimed to make for hundreds of years. Though they've never been scientifically proved, they have made something of an impact as there have been reports of people becoming ill and houses that have become mysterious entities. Reports of chairs being stacked and voices coming through electronic devices are among evidence of such bizarre happenings. My childhood friends and I were on opposing teams. Some of us believed in it. Some thought what we heard was nothing but coincidental. Like religion and god, it simply comes down to a matter of faith. Going back to the instruments used in paranormal investigation, the easiest thing people turn to is the Ouija board. Who can blame them as the board can be picked up at any nearby toy store and doesn't require some strange fuel like crystals that one might see at a new age place. All it took was the board, a piece of wood (or plastic these days) and courage to try and talk to the dead. This is something that I never dwelled in and is not nostalgic, but it remains as a nostalgic piece of slumber party memories for most children. Ouija is now the latest of the board games to become movies.Two girls, Debbie (played by Shelley Hennig) and Laine (played by Olivia Cooke) are simply two of the closest high school friends around. They do typical teenager stuff until Debbie starts to hear strange bumps around the house after using an old Ouija board. She's found hung and the police mark this as a suicide, despite never showing any idea of suicidal thoughts. Laine remains grief stricken over her loss and is given the task to house watch while her friends folks are out of town to get away from their loss. Laine along with her friend Trevor (played by Daren Kagasoff) discover the Ouija board that was being used along with some footage from Debbie showing her troubles starting when she played (it's never explained why she did so in the first place which is already confusing). Laine brings her friends back to Debbie's house where by using the board (there's never any other consideration into other objects into contacting spirits), they will try and communicate with their recently deceased. The board seems to work as the teens do feel a presence, but when the thing seems demonic, they think they may have awakened the wrong soul.In my review of Battleship years before, I claimed that Clue remains the best board game adaptation. I still stand by that because Ouija doesn't add much to the reason why we need movies. Presenting a movie out of the spirit board certainly has potential as it has a hundred year history of being used by real paranormal folks. I'm guessing neither of the two writers wanted to bother with that as it was simply easier to do a haunted house story.I have no problem with a haunted house story, but Ouija feels like a movie that was written by the book; that they simply thought of the typical ghost story tropes and then worked in the Ouija board. As far as I'm concerned, the board could have been a painting or a plastic cup and the story would have remained the same. The story itself is not even close to original. Dumb teenagers? Check. Never leaving the haunted place? Check. A false climax further extending the story? Checkmate! What perplexes me is that producer Michael Bay only seems interested in churning out horror movies that may have people coming, but never returning to.I'll give this two Ouija boards out of five. Ouija is something that might be seen as an example of following the book on how to get a script out fast without effort. As far as going back to Ouija, the signs point to no. Let's play Clue next time!",

            "content": "Blumhouse Productions delivers another horror movie......that everyone hates. No shock there. Am I right, or am I right? I knew going into the movie very low expectations were needed to walk away with any enjoyment, but even with my low expectations, I left feeling ripped off. The film is flawed from top to bottom, and one has to wonder why the film was even made, outside of the clear cash grab. The following is my review of Ouija.The film was written by Juliet Snowden and Stiles White(also directed). These two together wrote the 2012 film, The Possession. A film that was also garbage. So none of us should be surprised to see this movie was also trash. The film follows a predicable haunting story. If you want any originality, you will not get that from this film. When you make a story like this, most are going to the theaters for scares. The story never sets any effective scares up over the course of the film. The story is wildly thrown together against a wall. Characters are poorly processed. I understand horror movies mostly have bad character development, but when it is this bad, I am not overlooking it. So bad even that one character just dies with little suspense. So we are left wondering why that character got screen time anyway. My only positive point is that the story moves by rather quickly, mainly because it was meaningless. When a short run time of about 82 minutes, we should all be glad we won't have to suffer that long. This however shouldn't be a plus side for the film. The effort from Snowden and White is very poor, so a huge thumbs down.The film was directed by Stiles White, who also had a hand is writing this trash. This is his first effort directing a film. I won't flat out blast his directing style. I thought it was average at best, but that works in a horror film. No found footage or shaky cam is good in my opinion. Some of the death scenes are rather nice, and look great on screen. While none of the deaths scenes are anything we will remember once the credits roll, credit is due in that aspect. The film uses some jump scares to get people to freak out, but no one was buying these cheap tricks. The door slamming and things being pulled by strings is so played out. The stars of the film are Olivia Cooke, Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Bianca A. Santos, Douglas Smith, and Shelley Hennig. All unknowns to me, which is not a surprise since films like this like to keep the budget low, not having to sign on big stars. The acting is fairly generic. Nothing special, nor nothing over the top awful. Overall, White delivers in only one major area in the directing department. Other than that, this is a huge fail of a film that he decided to direct.The score was composed by Anton Sanko. He works a great deal in the horror genre, and also scored The Possession. While the score is nothing special in this film, it certainly wasn't bad. In some of the more intense horror scenes, the score is fairly well done. For the most part though, the score adds little depth at all. Sanko gets grade a little above average for his score on this film.Overall, the film just is not interesting, nor different from other genre films. There is nothing special to see here, and wasting your time and money on this fail of a film is just not wise at all. Hardcore horror fans such as myself will always rush to see horror films like this. Those on the fence should wait for home video if you do in fact have any interest in this film.2/10",

Many of you however claim that this film isn't 'scary enough', 'boring' or 'too repetitive'. I do have to agree with you except for the 'boring' part.

What A Big Mistake! Everybody knows that nothing good comes out with playing with a Ouija board but when Laine's best friend mysteriously dies, she finds footage of her using the board so she decides to try and connect to her through the board, with her friends. Clever! They then awaken a dark force which begins to make there life hell so they seek help to try and takedown the dark force. To be honest, I totally lost interest in this film once I saw that it was a gullible bunch of teenagers messing with a darker force. The acting isn't that great and the predictable storyline became tedious after a while. The little bit of action towards the end was also a let down, after such a big build up and I really don't know why they just didn't leave the whole board thing alone after the first mysterious death. Anyway, I totally didn't enjoy this film and I can't believe that it made so much money at the box office. Boring & Uninteresting!\u00a0Round-Up: All of the cast in this movie, haven't starred in anything major before this project so I can't really comment on there performance. Its the first movie from director, Stiles White, but he has contributed to many big movies with his writing and special effect skills. From Jurassic Park III, Galaxy Quest, The Sixth Sense, Interview With A Vampire and the Ghost in the Darkness, we have all enjoyed his special effects at some point and he has also written the Possession and Knowing, which weren't that great. With such a big profit at the box office, I'm sure were going to be seeing Ouija II soon but I personally won't be rushing to see it. My expectations for the movie wasn't that high so I wasn't that surprised with the outcome. It also didn't go down well with the critics which is why I'm so surprised with the box office takings. There's obviously still an audience for this type of movie but I still find it quite hard to take them seriously.\u00a0Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $102.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their supernatural, horror movies about a group of friends who try and connect to there dead friend through a Ouija board. 2/10",

I think the people behind this film must be lazy AND stupid. This is what often happens when directors fancy themselves as writers and pay their chums to write a screenplay with them.The actors don't seem to believe their own reactions, which become more and more flat as the film progresses. Laine in particular appears less and less engaged and interested in the increasingly incredulous scenes. Maybe she took up the use of mind-numbing sedatives to blunt her increasingly desperate self questioning of \"Why oh why did I sign up for this joke of a film?!\" Well, the director and writers obviously didn't care about the film, so why should they? \"Is there a presence here?\" they ask the Ouija board, while trying their best exude as little presence as possible themselves, silently hoping that their low impact approach to acting will make them invisible enough, so that people will forget that they were ever associated with this crime against film. The characters have no individual characteristics to the point of being hollow. The dialogue is so shallow and unrealistic that it made me laugh out loud and never allowed me to get immersed into the story. A good film IMO has a solid story delivered by decent actors, and makes me forget that it's a film. Ouija with its repetitive, inconsistent plot twists, parades a sign of \"I AM A (BAD) FILM\" in every scene. It's as if the \"writers\" were following a bad screenplay guidebook, hell-bent on using every rookie technique ever invented. Characters state the obvious, they say things that sound unnatural just to reveal information to viewers in a vague attempt of back story and they are suddenly experts on certain things. Without any explanation, Laine is suddenly sure that \"Mother is angry\". When Laine and Debbies bf find pictures of the people who used to live in Debbie's house, Laine's bf stiffly proclaims: \"Judging by these pictures, they were taken in the late 40's, early 50's\". Lol, who talks like that?! Certainly not a leather jacket wearing teenage college student, who is apparently also illiterate, because he has to call Laine over to read aloud the article he found about these previous tenants (an article which of course was the first one he found immediately on typing the words into the search engine of his laptop). And mental granny offers no logical reason for her advice of cutting the stitches off DZ's mouth in order to drive away the evil spirit. The highlight of stupidity is when Debbie's spirit appears in the final spirit battle, complete with triumphant background violins.The trailer resorts to false advertising to trick punters into wasting their time and money on this children's film, which shouldn't be allowed to be categorized as horror.

The biggest flaw concerning the movie is that it just isn't very scary or spooky. It's mighty slow to set the situation up, and the \"scares\" have that \"been there done that\" feeling I talked about earlier. To be fair, the teenage protagonists are somewhat more palatable than you usually get in horror movies, and the movie looks pretty good for what was just a five million dollar budget.

Instead of contacting Debbie, they find someone else. Now she and her friends must discover this spirit's past and to close the portal they've opened in order for them to not suffer its fateWhen I heard about this film near the end of last year, I thought it had a lot of potential based on the subject matter. But it turned out to be a vanilla/PG-13 (I use these terms interchangeably) horror movie. If you think watching people sit at a table is exciting, than this film is for you. I just wished it could have gone further in many areas. I personally did not find this film very scary which disappointed me but I was not surprised considering what I knew about the film. This is what happens when the film is marketed for a YA/tween audience. I guess it didn't want to alienate them. I think they are better than that. I found the story rather predictable where I was able to guess what happened next most of the time. I also found that the film skimmed over a few things story-wise which meant just having to accept things that are thrown at you and it suffers from many underdeveloped characters such as all of them. I never really cared about any of the characters so I wasn't too emotionally invested in them either. In my opinion, good horror movie have a few characters that are developed to the point that you become emotionally invested and care about what happens to them so we get scared with them because we believe that something bad is about to happen to them. They also have characters that we tend to not care as much about because they need people to kill off. I never got to learn too much about any of the characters so I didn't care about what happened to them and I will not spoil what happens but I will say that it did not do enough. Also the film was too short in that another 15 minutes could have done it some good. The end was pointless because it tried to hint at a sequel which is unnecessary and will probably not happen judging by how poorly the film did at the box office. Its a shame that the film was marketed to a younger audience because if it could have gone a little darker and dived a little deeper into the subject matter then the film could have been decent.Score: 6/10 keithlovesmovies.com",

Her friends want to know why so they gather around the board and make contact ...with something. The body count's not bad and a couple of folks get their mouths sewn shut (one with dental floss) but that was done to much better effect in the Paramount Pre-Code shocker MURDERS IN THE ZOO. Falling somewhere between ANNABELLE and INSIDIOUS 2, OUIJA's not bad -and there's jump scares galore- but it would have been better with an R rating.

One girl hangs herself in the beginning after burning her witch board and then her best friend upset for a scene or two. The best friend then gathers the rest of the friends to talk to her dead friend, a demon shows up and the dead ghostly friend saves the day.

None of them show any sort of hesitation. That is not realistic since at least one of them would maybe hesitate and back off from the whole idea. But this is Hollywood movie world and apparently they need to go ahead fearlessly in order to be proved wrong.I am ranking it higher than most people. I did feel that there is some creepy atmosphere at various points. The movie starts with a bang and that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. It has the usual James wan-like jump scares but it doesn't overdo it. Unlike maybe some other recent horror movies. Towards the end, it does start to get more frenetic. But still there were some good scenes. Like that scene with Debbie (or Doris)! But the story is nothing new and the twist (if you can call it that) can be seen a mile away.I was surprised by the fact that some of the scenes in the trailer did not appear in the movie. Supposedly a couple of scenes were removed. One of the scenes in the trailer was actually pretty good, I kept waiting for that scene and it never appeared. That could have raised the rating a bit. The ending is not so bad but maybe the victory was too easy. The last shot was a little irritating but this is now common in all horror movies.It seems Lin shaye has to appear in pretty much every horror movie nowadays and her role is not too bad as well. But maybe she could have been there longer. Olivia cooke is gorgeous but I found her character's decisions to be pretty strange.Overall I did enjoy it but was bothered by the unoriginality. There is no doubt that the ouija board genre has maybe reached its limit and they need to quit making movies about this. This movie shows the shortage of ideas in the genre.",

Does ANYONE really think that the portal between the living and the dead is through a board game that is owned by Hasbro and can be bought at any Toy store around? lol to those who still believe that nonsense. Beyond that, this movie carries some pretty poor acting (minus the lead who seemed to actually care to try at times) and the scares were way to few and far between to sucker in a horror fan. The actual camera work to me stood out since the few scares were set up well, but this movie as a whole is kind of what the problem is with horror movies lately. The formula is there, seems plain to most, but to excel you need to step out of the box with something to stand out. This movie just doesn't do that. Will you be mad for watching it? Naw, not really but you will likely step away just basically not caring just like I am (minus taking the time to let others know)",

            "content": "The Ouija board is probably one of the most mysterious instruments of spiritualism, and its ease of acquisition makes it specially appealing to teenagers who likes the supernatural. I have never used it but some of my friends with a taste for these themes have used it or know it well enough to ensure that its not a good idea to use it. Here, in Portugal, its better known as \"Jogo do Copo\" (literally Game of the Glass, because the triangular pointer is often swapped for a glass cup that has to be broken after the game). Basically, my friends told me that any spirit or demon can answer the call and deceive the players, and the board is the source of several possessions or supernatural disturbances. I don't know if that's true, I'm telling what I've been told, but I will not pay to see if it's true or not. As the people use to say here, \"prudent man has died old and suspicious man is still alive\". But let's talk about the movie, that's what matters.The film begins with a good horror premise: an Ouija board that is at the origin of the mysterious death of a young woman. The problem is that the whole plot that develops later is of an awful predictability. In terms of scares, the film also fails roundly. Neither the usual sound and visual tricks were able to make me jump from the seat because I was able to foresee them. The tension, usually compulsory in a horror film, is so absent that it can make us fall asleep. The characters are empty, devoid of personality or some feature that makes us like them, and that makes it indifferent whether they live or die. Some are truly stupid and we just don't care about them. The cast is composed of actors with no talent or experience, who deliver wooden performances, unrealistic and without remarkable merit. Finally, its necessary to talk about CGI, visual and sound effects: although the movie is visually regular, the computer effects are very boring and low, probably because of the low budget.",

            "content": "It's common knowledge that the modern day horror fan doesn't have a lot of patience. So if you're going to have a slow burning period in your film you have to be very crafty about it like 'Paranormal Activity' was able to be. Very few films are capable of pulling this off though and 'Ouija' is certainly not one of them, and yet the first 30-40 minutes play more like a drama than anything. The opening scene that is meant to set the tone for the movie and have audiences on edge from the word go is terribly done, with no tension whatsoever built due to it being so rushed. You have to see it with your own eye (no pun intended) to understand just how poorly this scene is directed. It really does defy belief in this day and age of filmmaking.So the film wasn't off to a great start. Finally things started to happen - but they didn't make sense. The characters were certain playing the Ouija board was the only thing to do, yet as soon as it actually moved they were sure it must have been someone else in the circle playing a prank. Not to mention the clich\u00e9 that accusation is, it simply didn't make sense to ask that. Poor writing. Then more death scenes that were just rushed to an unbelievable degree. They had all the patience with the dialogue in scene after scene but as soon as some violence starts up, it's rush, rush, rush. Newsflash: this is what we are here for! I can only wonder whether this was done to keep the rating down. Very disappointing whatever the reason.The final third of the film is definitely its strong point and saves it from being a complete misfire. There are some decent scares and while the writing remains atrocious (never once did contacting the police cross their minds?) at least we're finally getting a little bit of what we came for. Personally I think the movie was doomed to fail before it even began production, because Ouija boards in the modern day just aren't considered scary to any one with half a brain. Nevertheless the film was a box office success and I'm led to believe a sequel is on the way. Hopefully they learn from their mistakes in the first one and give us a good ride the second time around.",

Some of them uphold a unique charm that makes them perfect for a friendly film night with deliciously cheesy pizza. However when the scares are based around a wooden board game with characters undertaking the most stupid actions ever, well, you start to wonder why this was ever a good idea. After the apparent suicide of one of their friends, a group of students attempt to communicate with her through a spirit board, unknowingly awakening another presence instead. One point for Shaye just being in the film (God damn love her), one point for Cooke attempting to save this disaster with some genuine decent acting and the last point for the spirit demon girl crawling through the ventilation tunnel faster than Sonic the Hedgehog (na-uh, no thank you). That's it. The problem lies with its ludicrous, unfocused, monotonous, dull, derivative, unmemorable and predictable plot. You could say the film has 99 problems, but Shaye ain't one. A haunted board game just isn't scary. Setting up the rules and explaining how the game works just adds to its absurdity and wastes precious time that could be better utilised in actually developing a coherent plot. The friends can't act. The ouija board has more personality than them. Damn. Their purpose is just to be expendable as the demon spirit stitches their mouths together. Oh, but don't worry. You never actually see it. God forbid! Just them staring at the camera with bad visual effects on their faces. An alternative rebellious sister for no apparent reason other than to say the inconsequential line \"Yo! Can you hear me? Signal's real bad, only got like one bar\". M'kay I'm leaving now. The \"plot\" is constantly explained as if we're dumb, in particularly the scenes with Shaye and her \"tenacious niece\". And to top it all off, she STILL uses the board game at the end of the film!?

This film is quite honestly worse than I expected it to be, and I had rather low expectations. I wanted to like it, I wanted to give it a chance, put those bad reviews to the side. But there is no doubt that this is a bad film, and there is really nothing redeemable about it. The one thing I liked about this film, is Lin Shaye. Granted, she doesn't show up until like an hour into the movie and is barely in the film to begin with, but her performance is really the only good thing about the film, as she flat out nails her role. The other actors in the film are exactly how you expect them to be, wooden teenager archetypes with nothing to do but be murdered one after another. Its a plot and situation you have seen in horror flicks dozens of times before, and honestly, the film just shows how stale these tropes are truly getting. On top of that, the dialogue and script is atrocious, and incredibly predictable. I had an idea of how the film would go after the opening scene, and it went exactly as I thought it would, which is, at the very least to say, a shame. Besides the horrible dialogue and writing, the film also seems quite generic and seems to take much from other horror flicks of this nature- surprisingly a lot from the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. If you pay close enough attention, you can see just how similar a lot of the visuals, scenery, and setting is to those films, and it is quite painful to see that they couldn't even think of an original style for this film, let alone a story, direction, or script. In the end, Ouija is best left in the basement alone and dusty where it belongs, and truly offers a question as to what lengths Hollywood will go to for a simple buck today.\nMy Rating: 2.75/10",

Best friends, Laine and Debbie, play with the Ouija as children obeying the rules that they should be courteous and never play alone. Years later, Debbie uses the board by herself and strange things start to happen, which results in her growing distant from her friends and boyfriend. Using the ouija in solitary leads to her violent death.Laine agrees to house sit for Debbies distraught parents after the funeral as they need to get away. She realises the board had a part to play in her friend's death so rallies the others to help here prove the idea. Of course, this is a bad idea and the spirit they contact starts to plague them in their lives. From here on in, it's a race to save themselves and to solve the mystery of the origin of the board.There's nothing really new in this film that hasn't been covered before. The acting of the entire cast is above average and makes the film enjoyable to watch, as is the direction from Stiles White, who co-wrote the story with Juliet Snowden. Since this is a Blumhouse production there's a cameo from Lin Shaye, who, as always is good in her role (though I will always remember her as the landlady in Kingpin).This is one of those films that's worth watching if it comes onto telly and there's nothing better on.

This film stars Oliva Cooke who like Shelly Hennig(who is also in this film for a brief few minutes) are OK actors,there pretty new like they've only started acting like 3 years ago probably. This films effects were also horrible,God that scene where that ghost popped up was so terrible I wanted to get sick ugh. A sequel is approaching this October in about 2 weeks and it's from the director Mike Flanagan who directed Oculus which wasn't a bad film but I'm not sure if I'll see it..yeah..I'm pretty sure I won't see it. Ouija is a terrible,terrible,terrible movie that you shouldn't see only if you have the worst taste in films ever!!!",

The acting is horrible but the only person that did a decent job was Lin Shaye and she was in the movie for 5 minutes. The main actors didn't even put emotion in their characters and I was hoping that the ghost would get them because I didn't care for any of them. The story is so boring and it's not even scary. The movie felt so long that I just wanted it to end. Also the twist in the film was so stupid and predictable. The jump scares in the film aren't even scary. What Insidious did right is that when a jump scare happened it had a scary image. In this it didn't have scary images. This movie makes Annabelle look like a masterpiece. Hollywood needs to stop making films like this. Who ever found this movie scary needs to be medicated. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE I BEG OF YOU DON'T DO IT!!!",

If there isn't a thoroughly thought-out movie backing up the title then the weight of criticism these days would probably sink your life for a while. But They is a fantastic movie, full of chills and jump scares, great tension and exciting moments with tasteful, terrifying effects. I'm happy to report that Ouija is equally good. It's a highly intelligent and well thought out movie. There are many, many carefully chosen scenes that are absolutely classic. When I saw the low score for this movie I honestly got a shock. I think that young people these days have a skewed version of what is cool for them, which is rooted in social media trends and the similar consequent weight of historical opinion. Maybe these days a movie has to imitate something classic from the past to make the grade? Whatever. For me, Ouija was a brilliantly cast movie. The actors were engaging, and contrary to a lot of late teen movies they acted normally and there wasn't any sign of exaggerated bickering. The movie was also sweet in its secondary premise, that of sisters. The effects were really well timed, not over used, really effective and entertaining. I note that several of these actors have gone on to play major roles. You just can't get around the fact that a brave filmmaker has now made a really good movie titled \"Ouija\" and come out the other side, totally unsunk.",

Debbie was hanged after using the board she found at their attic. Her friends were suspicious and used the same board and started to get killed one by one. Laine found the old owners' photos at the attic after learning that Debbie found the board at the attic. There was a woman and two daughters. One of them was missing and the other was still alive and institutionalized at a psychiatric hospital. Laine visited her and she said her mother was practicing mediumship and using her sister as a conduit and she snapped and killed her sister by stitching her mouth shut. Laine found the body in the secret room down in the cellar. She removed the stitches from her mouth and she sent the mother away. But the killings didn't stop because the sister was lying. It was the girl who was evil and the mother was warning them. They burnt the board and the dead body of the girl in the basement and dark souls released. But they forgot the planchette and Laine held the planchette and looked thru the glass and the film ended there. Her boyfriend's death was pretty creepy as he was lured to the pool and downed in the pool cover and got back home soaked up and his mouth stitched shut. But the other killings weren't impressive. And it was nice to see Lin Shaye as the institutionalized sister.",

Chock full of by the numbers, YA ghost cliches, it somehow comes off more dated than it should, feeling like it would be more at home in the early 00s PG-13 horror boom.

            "content": "Ouija is another film that tries to be a good horror but actually falls some distance short and ends up being a very mediocre trip into the supernatural horror genre.As you watch you get the feeling that this is aimed more towards the mid/late teen age group...or it seemed that way to me at least not because of the PG-13 rating but because a lot of the content seemed to be \"dumbed\" down. The general feel & look of the movie says \"teeny horror\" but thankfully that isn't as bad as it sounds here.The story, while not the most imaginative, isn't all that bad but beware - it is rather predictable and full of horror clich\u00e9's. You have the predictable twist; the predictable \"jump scares\" (some of which aren't too bad to be honest); the main cast of characters acting in their usual predictable manner. There's definitely nothing original with this story so if you're hoping for a wee bit of that then you're out of luck here.The film takes a wee bit of time to get going as well, and doesn't really start picking up until about halfway through. I know that films can't dive straight in within the first 5 minutes, but there's too many stop/start moments within the first 45-50 minutes or so. It builds you up just to let you down, and it's the last 30 minutes or so that saves the movie from completely flopping in my eyes as this is where the majority of the action takes place.The scares in the movie are the old fashioned \"jump scares\" and as I mentioned earlier, some aren't too bad with the odd mildly decent freaky moment here & there (a younger audience will probably feel the effect more though), but you do get used to them very early on so they don't really come as a surprise as much as the movie goes on.The film cast is pretty average, but Lin Shaye is the highlight for me, and even though she's only in the movie for about 10-15 minutes she's as good here as she was in Insidious.Ouija isn't an awful movie by any means, but it definitely isn't the best either.",

No surprise there, but this is easily the weakest horror film from Blumhouse Productions in quite a while.This supernatural horror is boring, it's an easy word to throw at a movie title but it genuinely is a bore to watch, especially seeing as most the characters here are paper thin and undeveloped. However, I will admire the fact that Ouija doesn't stick to the staple clich\u00e9 horror characters like the usual cocky guy, the hot dumb girl and the black guy who bites the dust pretty quickly. Instead we are introduced to a bunch of close friends suffering from the loss of their friend after a supposed suicide, but none of them are memorable or feature interesting motives or traits. The scares are un-inventive and tame, eliciting only a minor shudder from me that leave no chills. A lot of the scenes are set during the day, all of Ouija is too bright and upbeat so when the night finally descends there's no element of creepiness or danger and peril for the characters. There are countless horrors with sequences set in broad daylight that terrify me, check out \"The Pact\", \"The Conjuring\" or \"Insidious 2\" for real daytime scares. Director Stiles White lends a finely polished product with some lovely still shots but fails to construct unease, his strongest moment sees the group of teens finally make contact with the entity that has reached out to them, I admit my hairs on my arms and neck stood up for a small amount of time, but then cheap jump scares creep in, ruining the atmosphere immediately.Olivia Cooke is easily the lone bright spot, her performance is a great mixture of fear, sadness, confusion and motivation, this Manchester born Brit actress is on her way to greater things, she's better than Ouija, as is Shelley Hennig who despite having less screen- time is convincing enough as a girl haunted by evil. Lin Shaye makes a welcome appearance that sees her ditch the ghost hunting confidence from the \"Insidious\" films to play a more vulnerable and innocent role.A few performances and well shot sequences aside, Ouija is hard to recommend, the ending is ridiculously silly and completely adds a campy tone to an already dull and overly serious horror that sits at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to scare tactics.",

Believable acting, as well as original camera set ups, atmospheric lighting backed up by a eerie sound and music design. But most of all the antagonist that has to have some truly frightening quality about him or her. Every decade has it's super villains. In 80's we had Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees. Michael Myers. In 90's the horror genre had \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", \"It\", \"Scream\" franchise, and by the end of 90's\"The Blair Witch Project\" that started the whole found footage phenomenon which basically continued through 2000's with \"Paranormal Activity\", \"The Ring\", \"The Grudge\" and \"The Others\", etc. 2010 started with an impressive and in my opinion one of the greatest horror movies of all time \"Insidious\" and continued with couple of descend horrors like \"The Conjuring\" and very good \"The Cabin in the Woods\". Specially \"Insidious\" proved that you don't have to have gigantic budget to create an frightening atmospheric horror and sometime lack of a big budget forces the filmmakers to be extra imaginative in their creation. \"Ouija\" is based in some way on a gimmick of using ouija board as a medium of communication between world of spirit and matter. It is always dangerous to create movie based on a concept alone and \"Ouija\" oozes of one dimensionality. \"A group of friends must confront their most terrifying fears when they awaken the dark powers of an ancient spirit board.\"This American remake of Filipino horror movie feels like a cheap student movie that got opportunity do be elevated to a mainstream Hollywood production. The actors do a decent job to maintain our interest in the script written by numbers but the story feels so predictable that after a while we are easily able to predict what will happen next and to not give it away to much, it all comes down to a consequence of what happens when you mingle with dark forces. The actors are all attractive which in someway, I suppose were casted to distract us form predictable story. But I can see them getting more work and better acting challenges which this film did not offer.The only redeeming part in this otherwise mediocre production is presence of Lin Shaye who slowly becoming a queen of horror movies. Her supporting role steals the movie in terms of believability and she is literally in 3 scenes which end up being the most reach in characterization and believability. Her supporting role might be the only reason to see this otherwise mediocre movie. The only reason why I did not give \"Ouija\" one star is a presence of Lin Shaye so that tells you what to expect.For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",

They soon decide to communicate with the dead girl using an Ouija board. However, they realize that the spirit board has awoken some dark spirits, threatening to end their lives. Ouija is yet another boring, uninteresting, generic mess of a horror movie that falls apart the moment you give it any thought. More importantly the movie is just not scary, it is all a collection of jump scares.Full Review:After the abomination that was Annabelle, I really wanted a movie that would redeem the horror genre this Halloween season. I quickly realized I chose the wrong film.Let's skim over the few positives the movie does have. Overall Ouija is well shot, there are no lazy framing. As a result the \"scares\" do come unpredictably, so kudos for that. The concept of a haunted Ouija board is intriguing. If you ever played it before it's bound to bring back some memories, which it did for me from my childhood (been 14 years and I still hate my friend for scaring and fooling us all!). So the first few Ouija board scenes were effective for the creep factor.The negatives however far overshadow the positives. In my Quickie Review, I was being generous with the plot synopsis. In reality the synopsis should be: A group of generic high school stereotypes play with a spirit board, and in between those scenes they talk about the spirit board, the end. The story is just boring, and it is clear that even the filmmakers felt that because there is a twist in this film that is simply forced in. This is not some assumption, it is a fact that they had re-shoots for this movie. Perhaps this twist was supposed to be some shocking revelation to make Ouija interesting. Instead the whole story logic just falls apart at its foundation. I don't do spoilers in my reviews so I won't say it, but really, read or watch other spoiler reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Honestly it is insulting how dim-witted the writers must think we are. It's as if the filmmakers really think we would accept these half-assed attempts at movies. A single neuron could figure out that the plot makes no sense.I sat down to write this review and the first thing I did was palm my face. Ouija made my hobby of writing about movies feels like work, that's when I truly know I hated the movie. Generic characters, generic scares, generic ghost deaths, just generic. I just looked up the definition of generic in the Oxford Dictionary and it says, \"a 2014 film called Ouija.\"Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",

It's ridiculous, uneventful, and....for a horror film....lacks the intensity and tension required to keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what might happen next.",

Halloween night we went to watch it, the whole room was packed with people expecting something new and scary as for the past few years there was really no good horror movies. From the minute it started it was incredibly boring, predictive and just cheap looking. Terrible story line, actors must have been picked up from a secondary school performance art classes as it was poor. The whole film was not scary at all, and I managed to nod off for 5 minutes as there was no tension what so ever, nothing encouraging you to stay focused and watch it paying loads of attention. In my eyes I just wasted my time, good job my cinema tickets were free otherwise I'd be fuming for spending \u00a39 on this terrible production.Over all, another low budget production with shocking special effects, (some guys on youtube make better animations)",

            "content": "Ouija is a movie based on the famous Ouija Board \"game\". When Laine Morris discovers the death of her best friend Debbie she is going to visit the house. In the house she finds a board. An Ouija Board. She and her friends still can't believe why Debbie died. Laine will try to convince her friends to use this board to contact Debbie because she can't let her go yet. When she convinced her friends she is going to play at the house where Debbie died. And when they start playing they think they are connected with Debbie. But later on they figured out they were tricked on connected to an evil spirit.A lot of bad reviews have been written already about these film which I partly understood. When you make a film about the famous game Ouija than you have a lot of opportunities with it. This film however never really took those opportunity's. The problem with this film only is the script and part of the actors.The first part of the film- before the break- wasn't so bad when you just look at the storyline. It started interesting with this girl who lost her best friend because of the game. And she wants to know what really happens. That is in fact what they wanted to achieve in the beginning of this film. But after the break we get to see walking skeletons which I didn't like at all. But the biggest problem was, I think, was that the evil spirit who was behind these kids changed too many times. Firstly they said it was \" The Mother\" and later it was her child. And that was the problem because you have to keep the audience watching, they have to stay interested throughout the whole film. And with these changes in the film it didn't make it really good. Though, of course the background story of the family who ones lived there was good. It gave a sort of development to the story which we hadn't seen in the film yet. But it was used in a wrong way.I always love to see when young unexperienced get a chance to prove themselves. And sometimes you see they do incredible things sometimes on a very young age. But sometimes it makes you hate the film because the choice of casting wasn't good. In this film I've seen three people in the casting who did a good job as playing their character. I loved the performance of Olivia Cooke, she shows in this film that she can play the lead role very good. Maybe one of the few things that were good about the film. I also liked the performance of Shelley Hennig who played Debbie, I think she did a good job playing a character who was so excited about this game and just didn't saw the danger of it. It was very nice to see Lin Shaye in this film as a very different character as she does in Insidious. I liked her performance. But the remaining cast didn't really convinced me very well.This film has scary moments but actually during the whole film and it is sometimes the same scary moment as they used earlier in the film, which makes it sometimes predictable. I rate this film 4/10; Olivia Cooke, Shelley Hennig and Lin Shaye saved this film from a lower rate, their performance was great. But the beginning of the film was just good- it started really well.

But, you expect more suspense and creepy ambiance from a ghost film, and Ouija just becomes another predictable vengeful spirit affair (with a bit of Final Destination chucked in for good measure - just without the invention and imagination of those movies), and a turgid one at that. As such, the pacing is slow, and the feeling evoked in the viewer is apt for a movie about the dead as it is totally lifeless. In the final analysis then, Ouija is a dull film and should be retitled Nonnein.",

The acting is right out laughable, it's as flat and thin as a pancake, just like the rest of the movie.The movie starts with Debbie, who clearly has a connection with the ouija board and some spirit. The spirit takes control of her body and kills her. Then her friends wants to contact her (although the reasons, other than: 'I can't accept the fact she is death' are unclear) through the board. Of course this goes wrong and there are more spirits in the house. But nothing shocking happens throughout the movie. Some words spelled towards each of the friends, a few doors that are moving and like I said, even the deaths weren't that great. Of course it has a plot twist, but it's something you could've figured out by yourself. Just don't see the movie, it's not worth your time.

            "content": "Ouija (2014) has an interesting premise, mostly everyone has heard of the Ouija board. There are really good points in this film, but overall it fails as a horror movie. It has too many jump scares, these can be used in a clever way (paranormal activity etc) but in this movie its like \"oh again really??\" after you watch the first 2 scares you know what's coming. Lin Shaye deserves a big nod I really love her and the movies she chooses to be in. Another mention should go to the sexy best friend I forget her name now but she was good too. Other than that the acting and performances were average at best. It is a shame that Hasbro and the production company lost funding while making the movie because it could have been a lot better in the effects department too. If I did have a couple of other things I would say about Ouija is that it did not explore demonology enough, although this was explored in a previous movie called ZoZo this movie was awful in comparison to Ouija but at least it explored reality in regards to the Ouija board. Another thing is that it could have had a disclaimer at the beginning of this film to explain that the board is not really a toy, considering Hasbro has had the rights to the Ouija board for decades and distribute it as a toy they do not say this enough and then bad things happen. Whether you believe in them or not though I would say that overall Ouija (2014) is a fun Halloween/horror movie but there is not much in the film that will keep people talking about it in years to come, although it does keep your interest throughout. It is nice to see the Ouija gaining some popularity again in the mainstream :-)6* out of 10Greg - Spiritual Counselling UK",

I am happy to announce that I was right to the very last scene.The plot is way too predictable right from the title screen.I mean come on! Who could not predict the plot simply by the name Ouija? Bunch of teens trying to play the board and ends up getting caught up in a really twisted fate and meanwhile side characters gets all killed. In the end only the main star stands breathing while everybody else have been killed off brutally. See downright predictable and almost nothing new at least in terms of plot.The horror in the movie is created by sudden pop of ghosts, shadows and lights. But do they manage to create an effect? Yes. At times. But not always. The plot tried its hand at being a little suspenseful towards the end but I felt it was too hasty and kind of \"obvious plot turn\"Character wise, I felt like barging into the screen and beating the central character, (Laine Morris played by Olivia Cooke) till she turned blue or start using brains. You will understand my feeling once you watch the movie.for the time being let's just say that the character is the reason why trouble gets started in the first place.I m talking for the character not the actor. Actors can't be blamed for a plot that had nothing to work around. Everybody kind of did their best to look scared and being chased by ghosts.While it is not exactly a painful watch it is not that impressive too.At the end if you want to watch it, you could, as far as you are not expecting to be scared out of your body. You could actually use to it play \"guess what happens next\".

While watching the house strange things start to happen and she finds a ouija board and decides to gather some friends to try and talk to their recently dead friend. Then some strange physical spirit activity starts, which is the poltergeist aspect of the film. Then the question is who or what is the spirit that is interacting with them, as the warnings with ouija boards go you open a door to anything and everything. So the search begins for where that board comes from and the history behind it and the identity of the spirit, which is similar to the plot of The Ring. It's good because there is a bit of mystery that keeps you a bit on edge and unlike Poltergiest's cheap random cop out of oh there is a burial ground here, the ending here is organic to the movie, you don't see it coming in the first 5 minutes but it isn't for way out of left field it develops as the movie plays out.",

She's alright in Bates Motel, but here (and in her recent roles) dunno why but whichever character she plays is the one I can't take seriously anymore. She sails through each role with the same distant, doe-eyed 'I'm thinking something important' look, and it's really gotten old already.The rest of the cast is the stock standard teen angst type. Good looking and dumb thinking. Nothing original here. I just really regretted watching this. When Shelley Hennig's character (Debbie) appears in the last act of the film to assist her friend, I literally laughed out loud - her expression and the way she appeared was so comedic.Well the target audience is probably not old enough to have seen a dozen or more similar haunting spirit films over the last few years and that's probably why we'll continue to get these kinds of features for years to come. *sigh*.Please people, don't waste your time, yeah it's horror so it's not meant to be an acting masterpiece, but even horror should have some level of atmosphere.

It starts off with Laine and Debbie as children playing with a Ouija board. Years later as teenagers, Debbie is home alone and is shown destroying a Ouija board. Laine wants Debbie to go to a game with her but Debbie is acting weird and tells Laine about the Ouija board and Laine dismisses it, she goes on her way and Debbie stays home alone. The spooky ookies start and Debbie hangs herself after seeing something through the planchette.This makes Laine go into full blown melodramatic teenager mode, who convinces her friends Isabelle, Pete, and boyfriend Trevor to go with her to Debbie's house to try and contact Debbie, with her sister Sarah tagging along because she feels she can't leave her same age sister alone. They make contact with whom they believe is Debbie, talk a bit, until the planchette moves to 'Goodbye' and all the lights in the house turn off. While the others are investigating, Pete gets his forehead smashed into a mirror and the group leaves, Laine taking the board with her, and later their housekeeper/grandmother (its never stated what she is) tells Laine to not use the board and get rid of it. After the first session, each of the teenagers is greeted with the message 'Hi friend' the next day. Laine decides it is Debbie trying to contact them because there is something she wants to tell them, so the group decides to go back to Debbie's house to try again. During the session some more things happen such as a chair moving, and the group, through asking questions, finds out who they were contacting was not Debbie, but an entity known as D.Z., a little girl with her mouth stitched shut, and warns the group to \"Run, Mother is Coming\". Enter scary ghost lady and the group flees in terror. Isabelle is the next to die after seemingly being possessed in her bathroom.Laine discovers D.Z. was a little girl named Doris Zander who was reported missing years ago and had lived in the house prior. She also discovers Doris had a sister named Pauline, who killed their mother and was sent to a mental institute. Pauline concludes that Laine had used a talking board to make contact, and tells her their mother had gone insane and sew Doris' mouth shut and killed her to keep spirits from communicating with her. Pauline tells Laine she must find Doris' body in a hidden room in the basement, and cut the threads to release Doris so that Doris can 'fight Mother' and free the group from the mother's curse. The teens find the body and accomplish the task but Pete is killed that night. Laine returns to the mental institute to ask Pauline why it did not work, and learns Doris is the evil spirit, not the mother, and that Pauline had promised Doris to help free her so Doris would leave Pauline alone and the mother had been trying to protect the teens. Laine consults her housekeeper/grandmother who tells her they must destroy the body and the board. So Laine, Sarah, and Trevor return to Debbie's house but Trevor is killed by Doris while the girls go to the basement. Sarah is captured by Doris and about to be killed until Laine starts using the board by herself, making Doris play with her. Debbie's spirit appears and helps Laine fend off Doris so Sarah is able to throw the body into the furnace, and the girls then throw the board in and Doris disappears. Some days later the girls are talking about the incident and after showering, Laine finds the planchette in her room waiting.Overall it was an overly done plot with bad writing, a rushed story, and bad acting. Laine essentially starts the cycle, yet becomes cynical later when Debbie tells her about having played with the board, then wastes no time becoming a full fledged believer. She breaks her own rules for the board, and has hostility towards her sister, who is supposed to be a 'wild child' that does nothing more than go out the front door to go out with her boyfriend whom Laine doesn't approve of. Note its okay for Laine's boyfriend to orchestrate a camping/surf trip and lie about it. And I'm pretty sure Debbie was manipulated into killing herself for deciding to leave a full plate of food out on the kitchen plate before going to bed.. that would aggravate any vengeful mother spirit.The Pauline side story was just unneeded and unrealistic, especially since Pauline says \"You used a talking board and you used it in a graveyard\", which goes completely unnoticed by Laine who doesn't bother to object to that statement or correct her. Other than that, it took about 50 minutes into an 89 minute film for the plot to show up and challenge the protagonists, and then it raced along to a very anti-climatic finish. Seriously, who doesn't report the body of a child that's been listed as missing for years to the police? Breaking into a morgue or having to dig up the remains would've presented some actual conflict to the ending, but the absence of any logic or common sense is quite aggravating in this film in particular. I'll end this on a positive note as being one of the rare times Michael Bay has been attached to a project and there wasn't an explosion every five seconds. Even the furnace scene was quite tame.",

I have seen several movies where a Quija board played a major role in the story line but to say it is clich\u00e9 or boring was simply not the case. This movie was geared for a young audience and not really adults past early twenties. I see some mention The Shining which is a movie I didn't like. It was over acted and silly but still entertaining to most. It definitely isn't a gold standard to hole anything up to.I don't know what people expected given the fact the story was about a group of teenagers who were using a Quija board. That portion was typical because most think of the boards as toys or evil. It is neither. Any movie made concerning these boards will have to attach possession or something dark and evil or there is no story. This is what people do, sit at a table and use it. It is actually supposed to be two people and the board is supposed to be between laps. I have seen the planchette move so quickly you have to have someone else write the letters down. NEVER has there been anything evil that followed. That is tied to religious beliefs but the movie wouldn't be able to go anywhere unless it went that direction. So I agree that part would be predictable but this story didn't follow others except in the fact there was a board.The acting was fine and the movie was well cast. I have seen horror movies that were so bad this one would win an academy award. Nowadays you can read synopsis or watch a trailer. There is no reason for anyone to go to a movie and not have a remote idea of what it was about. The bottom line here is there weren't enough blood and guts in it to satisfy some. I enjoyed it and it was a good jump at the shadows type of movie with a decent plot and that was, \"Why did Debbie kill herself?\"",

            "content": "Not gonna lie, the horror genre is not my favorite genre. In fact, when it comes to the big screen, horror movies, in general, have some of the more dumber plots I've seen. Ouija is just one example of how dumb horror movies are capable of getting.I've never played the game, nor do I care to, but basically this movie is about what happens when someone uses a Ouija board to talk to the dead. Okay, fine. The concept of basing a horror film out of a game is fine enough that I can give this film a shot. But the way this film was executed left a lot to be desired.The plot was pretty annoying. It was unoriginal and/or headache-inducing in many senses of the word. By the time all the characters I would ever know about got involved with the game, I knew everyone who was living and who was dying. Not only that, but the extra characters really just were there to bring on the headaches and annoy me with their presence. For example, one of the characters (Doris's sister who I couldn't care less what her name was) even told me one thing about the plot in the movie and it all ended up being a lie thrown from nowhere and at that point, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.The plot itself worn out its welcome not too far into the film. That's right! It was, at the beginning, tolerable. But especially in the second half of the movie, monkey wrench after monkey wrench was unnecessarily thrown when nothing is still known about any of the characters. Did the curse get broken or what? Why was the movie even still going at that point? What was still missing? The cliffhanger ending makes sure this question is never answered and even worse, what could have been 1 hour at the most is drawn out to 89 minutes. All in all, all I got from the movie was a gigantic headache.However, I will say that I liked Debbie as a character. She brings a little life into the movie. Also, as annoyingly devoid of intelligence as this movie is, it does provide a few jump scares and explains maybe a few things. All that saves it from getting a lower score, but it brings more questions than answers, it was grating to the mind, and I didn't really care for anybody at all.And now to set the movie from fire if I could.",

Then I made the mistake of watching the prequel / sequel first and re-watching the original second. Big mistake. The Origin writers had no idea what the first movie's history was. They did an awful job trying to give us more backstory on the Origin of Evil. But what they did do was have a wonderful child actress, Lulu Wilson, who was eerie and creepy and unsettling, something the original Ouija did not have. None of the cast stood out or acted well. It must have been the directing, because I have seen some of the cast in other things and liked them. This movie pales in comparison to Origin, but Origin sucks because it did not take the history told in this story and use it correctly. My recommendation, if you like one of these movies, don't watch the other. And if you want to watch both, watch them years apart so you don't remember the inaccuracies. I changed my rating to a 4.",

            "content": "Every horror movie breaks down into a few crucial categories: plot, characters, believability, and audio/visual design.1. Plot (2/10) -- As for the plot, it's iffy at best. I was less confused and more annoyed at the ~twists and turns~ that played out.2. Characters (dialogue, personality, etc) (5/10) -- There was nothing that particularly stood out about any of the characters; the dialogue tended to be awkward at best, their motives and morals seem to turn on dimes, and, as with most horror movies, they're dangerously oblivious to most of the threats.3. Believability (suspension of disbelief, realism where applicable) (??/10) -- While I often found myself criticizing the movie's realism, it IS a supernatural horror movie, and I've never been one to easily suspend my disbelief. That being said, while some may be more immersed, there are issues with some physical, testable, *cough* obvious *cough* things that were ignored for dramatic effect.4. Audio/Visual Design (10/10) -- The only thing that I found to be worth the $20 I spent on tickets was the audio and visual. Every camera shot, every movement, every angle was PERFECT and was a pleasant surprise compared to most of the rest of the film. Whoever did the camera-work is a genius.The audio was even better; one noise in particular toward the beginning left me with warm fuzzy feelings because it was so perfect realistic and obviously something the sound design worked hard on. Most of the fear from the movie came from the very subtle bass behind some movements. Placing a flashlight down, taking a step forward, even just opening a door, accented with an almost inaudible bass that you feel in your blood and guts that puts you in a pleasant unease, but not overdone to the point that you ever quite get used to it.Overall, watching it is an experience, and there are fantastic examples of what and what not to do in a horror movie. It was a learning experience more than entertainment, and while I'm likely to watch it again to get more specifics, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone looking for a good, solid scary movie.",

It's thrilling at times, and I agree that horror movies can be good, but that doesn't mean they all are, especially nowadays. Horror movies used to serve a purpose, they used to have a brain and a heart, and more on their mind than simply trying to scare everyone that goes to see it.So I'm not writing this on the film's ability to scare, if you want me to, then fine, I'll sum it up. The movie is as scary as any other horror movie released in the past 5 years. Also remember, the film is rated PG-13, which restricts it from showing too much, although I must admit it, they seem to have gotten away with a lot with \"Ouija\". It seems quite clear that most modern horror films have only one thing in mind: to scare the crap out of everyone as much and as often as possible. This has been the case for a while now, so much that I think people begin to forget about the story, which in this case, is absolutely horrible. It's even titled incorrectly, the Ouija board is barely a part of it, and it could've been better. It's basically only a reason for all of this crazy ghost nonsense to be happening, it's not smart or clever or unique in any way at all.On top of the lame story, \"Ouija\" has little to no characterization, and of course they get good looking young actors and actresses to star in it, because that's so realistic right? Honestly, I often got confused about the differentiation between characters. They're all so similar, and why does the audience care if any of them succeed at their ultimate goal: to stop the ghosts and such, you know, the stuff that used to matter in older horror films. It's possible to make a good horror movie, it is. It's just so difficult for people to do it when all that seems to be on their mind is the film's ability to be scary. Yes, they're horror films, obviously they should scare you, but we're all so sick of the anticipated jump scares. Can a movie scare us without finding the need to cheaply jump out for a quick second, especially when we can anticipate it? Horror movies are boring nowadays, and \"Ouija\" doesn't change anything. I watched a film called \"Psycho\". Nothing jumped out, no loud music played for a split second, yet it's chilling as hell. When I left the theater after \"Ouija\" I quickly returned to reality. A good horror movie should scare you with its story, it should have the ability to effect the way you think about the world. It should make you wonder. It should not make you laugh.",

The actors seemed to lack any form of emotion, the plot was difficult to pay attention to and the whole movie was annoyingly predictable. The only thing that I really respected to me was the fact that it at least TRIED to be original, unlike a lot of movies that have been released this year. I yawned from start to finish, finding it difficult to connect with any of the characters at all. I wouldn't recommend this movie to horror fans. It's really, really boring!",

It's full of clich\u00e9s and they're done in a totally serious tone, not in a playful homage kind of way.

That is part of the reason I cannot watch horror movies during the day otherwise you don't get the same effect afterward, I loved this movie, and I gave it a 9/10.

However, it had the perfect campy feel to it that had my sister and I yelling \"what are you doing? can you seriously be this stupid?' at the characters and sharing laughs. It's a fun movie.Most of the acting seemed forced as if even the actors themselves, the movie takes full advantage of every clich\u00e9 possible including 'the helper with a hidden agenda' and 'the spirit we vanquished because we thought it was evil was actually just trying to warn us oh no' and, my personal favorite, 'everything is calm and relaxed and we thought it was over but surprise! its totally not'; this particular clich\u00e9 must have been fun for the writers because they use it TWICE.

            "content": "There's a certain quaintness to Ouija, the supernatural horror film based on the game that allowed slumber-partiers to mess around with the occult. Were it not for the omnipresence of smartphones and a scene where a character watches an expositionally helpful YouTube video, the film could easily be a relic from back when Parker Brothers first flooded the toy market with Ouija boards in the '60s. None of the clean-cut teen stars in the cast smoke, drink, do drugs, have sex, or get even remotely nude (when one character is dispatched as she's drawing a bath, she's still wearing her socks). There's no real gore and nothing beyond what looks like a relatively minor effects budget, so without the usual trappings of a pick-em- off scare flick, Ouija has to rely on atmosphere and narrative. It excels at neither. To director Stiles White's credit, the movie takes its time building a world, beginning with an opening sequence in which the hero, Laine (Bates Motel's Olivia Cooke), checks in on her troubled best pal, Debbie (Shelly Hennig, of MTV's Teen Wolf). Debbie and Laine played with the Ouija when they were kids, and Debbie may have accidentally unleashed something sinister with it. Once the ground rules are established, and it turns out that the spirit of a girl murdered in Debbie's house decades ago is using our well-scrubbed crew as conduits for a resurrection (and knocking people off when she sees fit), the atmosphere created by White and cinematographer David Emmerichs falls away, and focus shifts to the thudding script. The early part of Ouija has some creepy bits that thankfully don't rely on simple sound gags. And it has the decency to not be a found-footage movie. But once the plot machinations kick in, it becomes kind of goofy, even for a film about malevolent ghosts who possess people through a board game. Ouija is one of those movies where everything is easily solved, even though those solutions are completely absurd, and the climax relies on both the advice of a character we barely know and a totally dopey deus ex machina. Within the pungent field of other wide-release scare jobs and films derived from cardboard-based time-killers for kids, Ouija stacks up relatively well, thanks to its look and a confident performance by Cooke. That said, it's still best left on the shelf. C-",

            "review_title": "Don't Believe The Hype",
            "content": "So first off, I'm pretty sure everyone who gave this film a review of 7+/10 is just trying to promote the movie. There's no way the movie could have been that large of a flop upon it's theater release and then everyone rented it and decided it was amazing. Don't fall for their tricks. Save your money for an actual scary movie.I've given this movie 3/10, which is really sad because I typically love b-movies- you know, those stupid ones where the blood looks pink instead of red? I guess I'm mostly upset at Ouija because it had all the makes for a great film and had amazing production, but the entire story was lacking. It's as if the producers from Insidous said \"Oh, we can just throw this out there to make money off of until our prequel comes out next year. They'll watch it because it's us.\" Thus, they did. And thus, I did. And I almost fell asleep. Twice. I NEVER fall asleep during movies. This is another teen 'scary' movie. But it's the kind where rich kids get into a bunch of trouble because their parents don't care about them. We know their parents don't care because they're ALL out of town the ENTIRE film. Except once. Laines best friend for all eternity, Debbie, gets snuffed out by a ghost at the beginning of the movie and when her parents come back for the funeral, they all but push Laine into watching their house while they leave town again. No tears, no remorse. It's like, Oh, our kid just died, will you watch our house instead? Thanks! And they're gone again. Second off, all the 'teenagers' (yes, they look too old to be in high school) somehow think that playing with a Ouija board is just 'playing a game'. Yes, we all know Hasbro sells the dumb things in toy stores. But we all also know that it's not 'just a game'. Half of them are purchased now just for the novelty of what they are. It's not like Laine and Debbie couldn't have just played Monopoly. It's also not like the board Debbie conveniently found in her attic was actually made by Hasbro. That thing was WAY too old to be 'just a game'. Another kicker is how Laine walks around asking people questions about Debbie the entire first half of the movie. I'm sorry, but aren't there people who do that for a living? Like I don't know, maybe DETECTIVES? Plus, she keeps asking Debbie's boyfriend for help, who, by the way, doesn't look near cute enough to be someone a girl like Debbie would date in real life. It's like they made him seem creepy to make him a suspect to viewers, even though we already knew straight out of the box that something paranormal was going on. And while we're talking about boyfriends, Laines boyfriend is no winner either. They make him seem sweet but he just becomes annoying by saying Laine needs to basically get over Debbie's death. I'm pretty sure if nothing paranormal happened in their lives, Laine and Debbie's boyfriends could have just got together and pulled off a remake of Scream- that's how weird their choices in guys are.To top all of this off, NOTHING that happened in the previews happened in the movie, and I'm pretty sure half of the pictures on this page weren't in the movie either. Only about three scary things happened, but they were mostly jumpy and expected. The 'terrifying spirit' was way overused. By the end of this movie I felt like I did at the end of The Ring Two, when they used Samara's (the little girl's) reanimated corpse so much that she started looking more comical than scary. Also, this movie has about eight different endings. They just decided to throw them all in the same movie so there's never a real climax- just an empty longing for the movie to finally end so you can take it back and rent something actually worth your while. I'd recommend Killer Barbies Vs. Dracula or Kracker Jack'd- those are a couple of b-movies worth staying awake for.",

There was nothing original about the film. Heck, even Jumangi held more interest for a film based on a board game. The supernatural in this was rubbish. Special effects added nothing to the movie and I would even suspect it had a really low budget.Acting was bland, you couldn't get into any of the characters. None of them had story, with most simply being put into the film to make up deaths from what I can tell. No one even died in original ways.

It is slow to start but this is actually a good thing as you are introduced to the characters, and fully aware of what is going on. However, once the viewers are aware of the storyline the film tends to speed up and rush towards what can only be described as a very abrupt ending.I adore a good (hide behind a cushion) jump scare, and this film on a couple of occasions didn't disappoint. The story as mentioned is very well thought out and could have been fantastic, but it is ruined as it has been rushed. Overall it isn't a bad movie, there isn't any disgusting filth in it (like most horror films nowadays) and it is worth a watch. I rated it a 4/10 perhaps I was harsh, it could possibly be increased to a 5 or a 6. Would I watch it again? Perhaps, if it was on tele one night and I was stuck for something else to watch.
