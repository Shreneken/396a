            "content": "I was dragged to this \"movie\" by a Christian friend who keeps thinking that I\"ll finally come around to her religious way of thinking. Jeez, it was worse that I expected. Atheists are portrayed as evil beings who \"hate god\" and are determined to convert Christians. Actually, atheists do not \"hate\" god; god is simply something they don't believe exists. As to forcing their way of thinking on anyone, the movie has it backwards. It's Christian zealots who demand that everyone think like them. Most atheists - those that I know anyway - are happy to let others believe as they wish as long as they don't force their \"values\" on the rest of us. As to production values, etc., the film is pretty basic. The lead actor over-emotes and the supporting cast of Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cain look pretty silly. The plot is pretty much what you'd think. Thoughtful friends shouldn't let friends see this piece of propaganda: it has no basis in reality. As to Christians, knock yourself out. Like Fox News, it's been produced to reinforce your preconceptions without actually presenting another point of view in anything resembling a thoughtful way.",

There's not really any message within \"God's Not Dead\", just an assortment of validated stereotypes. And even though the film seemingly debates the existence of an all-powerful being, it's really more concerned with extraneous side characters and the shoehorning of reality stars and a rock band. Kevin Sorbo's playing a personified strawman (before going full-on bad guy), which should give you an idea just how seriously this movie treats the philosophical subject matter. What made it hard to stomach was the syrupy tone; it felt a lot like \"Crash\", and that's the last thing I need with a movie about God.But its real crime is the horrible pacing; an interminable two hours. This thing's a trainwreck.4/10",

            "content": "My first thoughts after walking out of the theater were absolute horror, disgust, abhorrence, and sadness. The film turned what could possibly have been a good idea -- an atheist professor debating the existence of God with a Christian student -- and made sure to destroy ANY sort of message that could have been gained.Let's talk about the OBVIOUS and TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE stereotypes presented by the film. We have a lone Muslim character who beats his daughter, an atheist professor who just happens to be the biggest narcissist this side of the Mississippi, an idiotic reporter, the idea that all atheists chose their lifestyle because deep down they hate God, and even more nonsense that I can't fit in this post.I'll sum up the entire film for those of you who haven't seen it yet: An atheist professor makes his class declare that \"God Is Dead\" (which is extremely un- professor-like in this day and age, so there's that), and the lone Christian student in his class spends the entire film convincing him that God exists. Then we find out that his professor isn't actually an atheist, he's just mad at God for not saving his wife (or mother? I've already repressed most of this film).The entire movie is just one giant atheist bash. Zero minds will be changed, and the rest of the world has yet ANOTHER reason to point and label Christianity as a giant pool of judgment and bigotry.What makes me sad is the fact that this film is far exceeding the box office gains they'd projected to make, which means we'll be seeing even MORE terrible Christian films coming out that continue to preach to the choir and give the world more reason to turn away from the Church.I can't be the only one sick and tired of this. We haven't had a decent film about the Christian faith since Charlton Heston portrayed Moses in The Ten Commandments. I feel like unless we have serious discussions about the future of Christian film, and boycott these terrible attempts at shaming people into Christianity, then Christian films will continue falling towards this downward spiral into obscurity.I feel like I'm going crazy as I read yet another \"glowing review\" praising trash films such as this one, while giving no good reason for a decent filmmaker to put out a solid Christian movie. If that day comes, I'll die a happy man, but until then, can we please stop encouraging this?",

            "content": "So first of all, in God's Not Dead, let's get this out of the way first: this is not how a college classroom works. As someone who has now been teaching in a college for over a year now, I've seen first-hand how students act and react to things, and more importantly how professors act. Maybe this character that Kevin Sorbo plays has tenure, maybe he's an 'untouchable' in Academia. But how this class operates - how he firmly puts it to these students that they must write down on the first day of class on a piece of paper 'God is Dead' and that counts as 30% of their grade - is just stupid and illogical off the bat. What goal is this professor looking for? Does he want a *sincere* answer from these students? The conflict comes that one student (named Josh Wheaton... like uh, Joss Whedon, I guess for some reason) challenges the professor by not writing it, not because of any logic about how a classroom works, but because he's a Christian and won't give in. So then an entire debate is set up - forget a class being taught or lessons - between the theist side and atheist side.This isn't to say the movie doesn't pour on its message thicker than syrup on a dozen stacks of pancakes. But even having to think about this shows that the director and writers here don't care about having actual, human characters here. Not really. They have some kinds of shades of what a person might be like, like, well, words and thoughts and things, but there isn't much past: this side believes, and this side doesn't believe, and they really, deep down, don't believe because either someone in their family died (the professor) or may be dying soon (the reporter woman, who by the way gets a very hackneyed scene where an a-hole boyfriend breaks up with her after her cancer news).It would be one thing if it was just this BS straw-man back-and-forth in front of a plastic classroom full of stick figures for these mouth-pieces to talk (and that's what they are, make no mistake about that, unless you're already coming to this as the heavily-converted). It's really in the structure of something like Crash, a multi-character 'tableau' that has some very minor connections to some of the characters - it all comes together, naturally, at a Christian rock concert in the last third. There's multiple crappy plots to go along with the main 'plot' of the freshman student and the professor, including the local pastor/preacher/whatever and a car that won't start (the rental car guy that comes is meant to bring the one 'joke' that falls flat), and a Muslim girl and her strict father, who we know NOTHING about and decides to go for Jesus and gets slapped and kicked out of her house.Who is she? What about the reporter, who we maybe know a little more about due to her sorta-storyline with cancer and interviewing a guy from Duck Dynasty (huh) and then later in a prayer circle with the Christian rock group at the end. She has just the shades of anything like real motivation, past \"I'm going to die, that sucks.\" And what about the professor's girlfriend, who is made to look like a doormat to her boyfriend (always an a-hole, even up until the very end of the film), and says she is a Christian but has little to really say against her super-Athiest-Dogmatic man? So many of these scenes, for all of the characters, are just springboards so that people can get into these arguments and talks about God and faith that are, for lack of a better or more original expression, preach to the choir: you already know coming to this that God exists, right? Then get ready for some mighty Christian rock (ugh) and messages from certain intellectuals in lecture-form about this. You know God doesn't exist? Or are unsure? Well...There's no middle ground here, no other voice or nothing to make for any real spot for ambiguity. And even with the sense of these students really having their own thoughts or expressions in the class there's basically nothing (one student, out of the blue, quotes Richard Dawkins like she knows it off the back of her hand, at the start of a 101 Philosophy class, and another, the Chinese student, kind of a supporting character, has a moment with his far-away dad who says simply 'yes, the professor says God exists, He exists, go away'). Ultimately it comes down to the script for a lot of these problems, and how it's really, aside from having badly written characters and bad dialog and not necessarily bad filmmaking but bland direction (and among the actors, only Kevin Sorbo doesn't look there to drone on with little emotion), it's an anti-intellectual film. It's epitomized in the whole 'hook' of the college classroom, which is (to repeat myself) how a classroom works, on any level.So near the end, if you're still enraptured by the message and praising Jesus as people become converted and songs are sung and the Duck Dynasty guy returns (?) then have at it. But as a film, as a story, with characters, and a meaningful message, it's as subtle as an anvil dropped Wile E Coyote.",

No, I'm not an atheist of any flavor. Then what you may ask am I? Good question, but nobody took the other position. As Ecclesiastes implies, there's a time for gray, and a time for black and white.I knew I was in trouble when I saw all the old people and young families with school age children in the audience, the religious themed previews, and someone in the credits listed as an expert on apologetics. As I predicted elsewhere, deism or anything like it never came up, and neither did anything like soft atheism. All the good guys were Christians and all the bad guys were mean spirited, glib, sarcastic and/or hard atheists.The best line in the movie came when the kid asks the professor \"If you don't believe in God, how can you say he's dead\", which drew smile from me, but great laughter and applause from the crowd confirming my earlier assessment about the bias of the packed audience this Friday afternoon. It was the coup de grace from one strawman to another. The ending after that, with all the implied miracles and the dying conversion, was sickening.",

            "content": "I'm a Christian and I'm embarrassed to say that I used to love this movie. I've seen it 4 or 5 times- but in my defense, it's been 4 years since my last viewing. At the time, I think I felt that since this movie was trying to spread a Christian message, I should like it.If you look at my page, you can see that I have changed my mind on that for plenty of faith-based films. And God's Not Dead is a prime example of why I, a Christian and a film buff, hate many modern Christian movies.The movie God's Not Dead has numerous plots, however the main one, and the one I will center on, follows Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper), who is a Christian and a college freshman who has to take a philosophy class.His teacher is an atheist named Professor Rattison (Kevin Sorbo), who tells his students to write on a sheet of paper: God Is Dead. All of the students do this, except for Josh- who refuses due to his faith.Therefore, Rattison gives Josh an alternative assignment- for the next 3 classes, for 20 minutes each, he has to give a presentation that gives evidence for the existence of God. If he can't convince the class that God exists by then, he fails.In a way, the plot is intriguing. Part of the reason why I used to like it is because a faith vs. Science controversy (or whatever name you want to give it) is a compelling topic. But how the movie goes about it is cruel, unrealistic, and stupid.First off, there's the plot. It could never happen. Wikipedia reports that as of 2019, 65% of Americans believe in Christianity. Statistically, 6-7 out of 10 Americans would side with Josh. But no, Josh is the only student out of 80 kids that believes in Jesus, let alone a god.Then there is the portrayal of the atheist characters. Every atheist is a jerk in the movie. The professor's name-calls God (in one scene he calls Him a \"dictator\"), he bullies Josh, and like I said, he will fail Josh if he can't convert 80 atheists to faith in 60 minutes.That goes for other atheist/non-Christian characters as well. A Muslim beats and kicks out his daughter for becoming a Christian, a businessman neglects seeing his religious mother with dementia, his atheist girlfriend has cancer (which is cured in the NEXT movie after she comes to faith), and so forth.This movie implies that if you are not a Christian, you're a jerk. I'm sorry to say that, but that IS what is implied.When it comes to Josh's arguments, they're kind of thin. In his 1st argument, he states that the Big Bang could not have happened because then nothing turned into everything, which is impossible.A student points out that Richard Dawkins has stated that if a Christian makes this argument, atheists have the right to ask: \"So who created God?\" Josh gives the correct point that Christians do not believe in a created God- He is eternal.He says that atheists should be asked: \"If the universe created you, then who created the universe?\" I suppose that's fine, but this does not argue for God's existence, and he somewhat avoids the students' question and never fully answers it. And of course, this \"Christian\" movie never makes note of that.I don't recall much of what the 2nd debate is about, so to cut to the chase, allow me to skip it and go to the next scene.After the 2nd debate, the professor privately tells Josh that HE used to believe in God, but his mother died of cancer after he prayed for Him to heal her. So apparently, he's an atheist because, in his mind- \"if God exists, He will care about my mother and heal her for my sake.\" It's normal to feel that way when you are a Christian child (My father died when I was 9 and I remember having those feelings), but God doesn't suddenly not exist because of one tragedy He allowed in your life.Josh uses this for his 3rd debate, and he asks the professor: \"Do you hate God?\" He scoffs at this (as he should) and so Josh asks: \"Okay...WHY do you hate God?\" He hammers him with this question until Rattison snaps: \"Because He took everything from me! Yes, I HATE God! Everything I have towards Him is HATE!\"Then Josh, who initiated the question in the first place, asks the professor: \"How can you hate someone who doesn't exist?\" When I was 16, I thought BURN! Now, I think- WELL NO KIDDING! There's the 6th Sense-level plot twist for you- Mr. Rattison isn't really an atheist, he just has a grudge against The Almighty.As thin and convoluted as this argument is, it's what suddenly converts all 80 students to believe in God. The professor doesn't convert, however, until he is hit by a car.Can you see the problem God's Not Dead has? It's a hateful, biased, flawed movie with logical fallacies as a side dish. It shouldn't even be considered a \"Christian\" movie. Jesus taught to love our enemies, as well as those we do not agree with. Atheists are included in this matter. And again, I apologize, especially to atheists, for once liking this movie.I could go on a lot longer, but you get the point. I was going to re-watch the movie to find my rating, but 1/10 seems to fit, especially since I have analyzed why. I haven't seen it in years, and I intend to try to keep the record going.God may not be dead, but if He were, this movie would probably make Him roll in His grave.Note: If you want to see more reviews that helped me open my eyes to how flawed and unlikable God's Not Dead is and should be, I suggest going on YouTube and looking up Say Goodnight Kevin's half-hour review or seeing Josh Keefe's video The Problem With Christian Movies.Reverse Recommendations: If you want some GREAT Christian movies, here's a few I highly recommend to get you started:The Apostle (my favorite Christian non-Biblical movie), Silence, Hacksaw Ridge, Lilies of the Field, Francis of Assisi, Soul Surfer, The Disney Narnia movies, I Can Only Imagine, I Still Believe, Sheffey, Say Amen Somebody, Billy, Chariots of Fire (a superior \"stand up for your religious beliefs\" movie), The Case For Christ, and even Jesus Camp. God's Not Dead puts Veggie Tales on cinematic par with The Ten Commandments.",

I mean this movie (and I use that term loosely) is so bad that it really has me wondering what the creator of this movie was thinking. I mean overly clich\u00e9'd stereotypes, mixed in with a ridiculous premise, coupled with even more ridiculous subplots. All culminating around the premise of a professor at a University requesting to do something that I am pretty sure would be deemed illegal and I have never come across or even heard of, someone making people sign a paper denouncing their religious faith. My favorite part is they then allow this kid to argue points of which in this day and age people can watch on any youtube clip, probably have already come to their own conclusions and doesn't answer anything on either side, in my opinion. So the fact that everyone thinks this movie is preposterous in a united front is quite amazing, and if that was the intent of the creator of this movie, then he is a genius!!",

            "content": "'GOD'S NOT DEAD': Zero Stars (Out of Five)Christian propaganda movie about an extremely religious college student who takes on the challenge of debating his atheist philosophy professor, whether God exists or not, in front of his class. The film was directed by Harold Cronk and written by Cary Solomon, Chuck Konzelman and Hunter Dennis. It stars Kevin Sorbo (of TV's 'HERCULES' fame), Shane Harper, David A. R. White, Trisha LaFache, Cory Oliver, Hadeel Sittu, Benjamin Alfred Onyango and Dean Cain (of TV's 'LOIS & CLARK' fame); it also features cameos by the Christian rock band Newsboys and Willie and Korie Robertson (of TV's 'DUCK DYNASTY' fame). The filmmakers only intent here is to convert non-Christians and they go about it in a pretty despicable way.Josh Wheaton (Harper) is a Christian freshman, enrolling in a philosophy class taught by Professor Jeffrey Radisson (Sorbo). He soon learns that Radisson is an atheist, who doesn't want to waste time going over religion in his class, so he asks all of his students to sign a statement proclaiming that God is dead (in exchange for a passing grade, for that portion of the course). Josh refuses to do this, so Radisson challenges him to debate the topic with him (in front of the class) and allow the class to decide who has the winning argument. Josh feels his faith insists he accept the challenge. The movie also deals with several other characters, in side plots, dealing with their own religious struggles. Despite the amateur filmmaking, bad acting, ludicrous scenarios and lack of character depth, this film represents everything non-Christians despise about Christians. It's extremely bigoted in it's portrayal of atheists and just about anyone else, that's not a Christian. Atheists are shown as hateful and vengeful people; and followers of other (non-Christian) faiths are displayed as misguided individuals. The Christians in this movie are also shown as pretty self righteous individuals, that care more about being right than doing what's right. The message here seems to be solely that you have to accept Christ as your savior and not actually follow what he teaches. I grew up a Catholic and I'm still an extremely spiritual person; I also know a lot of Catholics and other Christians.

            "content": "It's impossible to review Christian films because if you're a believer you think this is a great film with a great message. If you're a skeptic or an out and out atheist you'll not view it kindly. Credit however should have gone to such items as Crash, Magnolia, and heaven forfend Boogie Nights because in terms of structure God's Not Dead most closely resembles those films. There's a bunch of stories with people all interconnected somehow.But the main plot line involves young Shane Harper who is a Christian kid who is taking philosophy as an elective course. Instead of free academic discourse we have Professor Kevin Sorbo right off the bat wants to have his students declare God is dead. Harper is the one holdout and Sorbo essentially turns the class over to him, not for just one lecture, but for several periods where Harper has to get up and defend his faith.Back in the day I had college professors, mostly liberals to be sure, but would never act like Kevin Sorbo does. Later on we learn in the film that he's got some deep issues.As for Harper, he's told by the local pastor David A.R. White that this is an opportunity to go to bat for his faith. It would have been a lot easier to just drop the course and take another elective. In fact Harper is such a devoted believer one wonders why he's not in some place like Jerry Falwell's Liberty Baptist University or Pat Robertson's Regent University. Especially the latter since they have a law school there with guaranteed employment in the Justice Department when a Republican administration is in power.As we all know Kevin Sorbo first came to prominence portraying that most mythic of pagan heroes Hercules on television. Another former television superhero in this film is former Superman Dean Cain who is a lawyer with one colossal ego. His part is almost a caricature, especially when his girlfriend tells him she's got cancer. What a comfort Cain is to her.Christian icons like Willie and Korie Robertson from Duck Dynasty make an appearance. The finale is a concert by that most noted Christian Rock group the Newsboys. As a non-believer, not an anti-believer and there is a difference despite the position this film takes I'm not thoroughly trashing a job moderately well done. Why though the existence of a Creator/Deity is automatically meaning that a fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity is necessarily valid. Or a literal interpretation of any religion for that matter. Harper even concedes that there was no literal 24/7 creation. I suspect that if he had tried to defend the Bible in a literal interpretation of the flood or Joshua stopping the sun, etc., things might have turned out differently.One thing however did offend me greatly. David A.R. White is playing host to a visiting missionary from some unnamed African country. These are the same people who are currently pushing with glee and delight pogrom like laws against gay people in many African countries. Of course no mention of that in God's Not Dead, but I assure you that any gay people who see this film will mark it well for this colossal bit of hubris.Technically God's Not Dead is not a horrible film, but people depending on their point of view will react accordingly to it.",

This means that nearly 2 out of every 3 persons who voted on the movie opted for the extremes. I have checked out the ratings on perhaps 15,000 films and I can guarantee that you almost NEVER see polarization as extreme as what is exhibited here! But THIS is MY Review of God's NOT Dead.My RATING: I awarded it 7 Stars, after my second viewing...After My first, I rated it 6 because of something on screen just before the end credits. First off: O. K, I must admit I usually make it a point to avoid the \"Faith based\" sub-genre. Were I to explain, it would involve a couple paragraphs. So just refer to the Title of this review and use your imagination, O. K.?Why? You must be asking yourself, Why did you decide to watch this? Fair enough question! Well, in conjunction with our English Classes, one frequent activity we utilize is watching a film together and then discussing it. The students usually select which films we watch. \"GOD\" was the result of this process.Truth be told, my expectation was extremely low. Make that \"abysmal\". Had I seen it 40 years ago, it just might have been given 1 Star. That was when I was still going through my virulent Anti-Catholic phase. You probably know the drill...Brought up as a Catholic, quit Catholic school at age 14!....etc.Now, although certainly not a religious person, I would qualify myself as at least a relatively spiritual one. Respect for other people, their beliefs and their belief systems should be a major consideration in ALL our interactions. Needless to say, you might have noticed that this, all too frequently, is not the case!At its core, \"GOD\" is a David vs. Goliath cautionary tale. A newbie devoutly Christian College Freshman (Shane Harper) is forced to take on his seasoned, hostile Philosophy professor (Kevin Sorbo) to defend the existence of God.At the onset, it seems our Freshman's task is predestined to dismal failure. But the movie is a case study in perseverance and standing up for what you believe in. Who could possibly not like that?... Apparently, a lot of people! Accompanying that 28% 1 Star Rating demographic, there must be a lot of snickering and eye-rolling going on in response to its \"Faith-based\" label. Maybe we could use a little bit less of that dismissive attitude in our society in general!7******* ....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments or questions, in English o en Espa\u00f1ol, are most welcome!",

The whole movie appears lazy, poorly put together, unrealistic and just flat out fake. This movie paints atheists as \"evil\" and \"stupid\", which is extremely unfair. Atheists just don't believe in god, they are not evil or unintelligent. I feel like this movie kinda bullies atheists. I love how the music gets all corny and rainbow and sunshine when the Christian kid comes on screen, but the tone goes all bad and rotten when the \"evil\" atheist comes on. Some of the lines of dialogue in this movie are honestly hysterical, absolutely hilariously awful. I'm sorry but this movie was just soooo fake and unrealistic. I saw where a sequel is being released. For heavens sake! Why?!! Pull the rip chord! 1/10",

            "content": "I've got to be honest here and state I didn't come in to this film with a greatly open mind . I'm an anti-theist who considers religion the worst man made invention but since this Christian slanted movie did some astounding business at the American box office last year I thought I'd check it out and give a fair minded assessment of it especially since the comments here are split against \"Worst film ever made\" and \"Best film ever made\" !!!! SPOILERS!!!! The main story involves itself with the intellectual struggles between newbie freshman Josh Wheaton and Professor Radisson during a philosophy course . Josh is a Christian while Radisson is an anti-theist , not an atheist , an anti-theist is a militant outspoken atheist . Guess whose side we've going to take ?I've got a confession to make . I once did a part time University course called \"Arguing about religion\" where I got a B ( Offscreen rapturous applause ) Thank you . What the course involved was answering the basic fundamental question \"Can human morality exist without God?\" where as this film has a similar premise - does God exist and if not how can human beings be moral beings ?\" In other words it revolves around the Dostoyevsky proclamation that \"God is dead therefore anything is permitted\" From the get go the wheels start coming off very quickly . Radisson is portrayed as someone who is bitterly biased and ready to fail anyone who disagrees with his world view but is this how things exist in American Universaties ? My own experience of arguing about religion is that the course was very even handed and you had to see both sides of the argument . GND doesn't take an even hand . Radisson is a bully and wants to fail Josh simply because he believes in God and would someone like this be allowed to teach at an American university ? I'm guessing he wouldn't They're not real characters but simply plot devices used to act as sounding boards to put flawed arguments forward The arguments put forward are sadly totally inaccurate . Radisson states Professor Stephen Hawking is \" the greatest human mind in human history\" but this is simply not true . He is the world's most famous living scientist who has done a lot to popularize science amongst the mainstream public but he's never won the Nobel prize . No one with a science background would call him the greatest human mind in human history or even of the 20th Century . Likewise the constant references to Richard Dawkins as if he's on a par with being the greatest biologist ever which again is simply not true . Dawkins and Hawking have never claimed they're the infallible geniuses Radisson paints them as but all this hypebole is used to set up an important plot point at the end of the film Radisson reveals himself to be an anti-theist because bad things have happened in his life . Bad and cruel things happen to all of us but is that what turns people in to atheists- because they're angry at God ? The only time as an adult when I do believe there might be a supernatural being controlling the Universe is when bad things happen to me as they do to all of us at some points of our lives but \"an anger at God\" is not my motive or I guess anyone elses motive at disbelieving in God . Our disbelief mainly comes from the fact that not only is there no evidence that there is a God all physics , biology , chemistry make this highly unlikely . Perhaps most compelling of social scientists and philosophers like Marx make an absolutely compelling argument that a belief in God and an afterlife is only down to social conditioning and cultural environmentActually this is an unintentional irony of GND - God simply exists because characters say so . God exists because the students have a vote at the end ! So science and reality is all down to public opinion is it ? God exists because people go to Christian music concerts ? God exists because Willie Robertson tells everyone God's not dead ? God exists because someone puts it in a text message ? And most ironic of all the villain of the piece who the audience are supposed to throw popcorn at Professor Radisson last dying words are that there is God and therefore it proves there must be God ! I know Americans don't get irony but the arguments put forward here illustrates the reasons why many human beings don't believe and I can't believe how na\u00efve and ironic this film is",

            "content": "First, let me say that I did actually watch this movie. The only reason I gave it a 1 was because I feel like I need to counteract all of the 10s it is getting from Christians, which it doesn't deserve, even if you look at it from a unbiased perspective. I start every movie with 5 stars and it goes up or down while watching. The acting is terrible (-1 star). The score is corny, and laughable (aka - The ominous music that plays each time the atheist enters the scene)(-1 star). The writing is extremely lazy and predictable(-1 star). It's just....bad. It does have some entertainment value though. As an atheist watching with several others, some of the arguments presented did provoke a conversation afterward (+1 star). For that, I would give it maybe a 3. Now, that being said, it is impossible to look at the movie from an unbiased perspective because it has a clear agenda. The movie itself is ridiculous. Let me sum it up. I'd give a spoiler warning, but I think everyone knows how this ends before even watching. There are 3 antagonists - The atheist professor, and a liberal blogger that writes attack journalism. They are both portrayed in such a clich\u00e9 manner (ie: rude, angry, snide, arrogant, incapable of loving anyone, etc) that it would almost be offensive it it weren't over the top comical. They both convert to Christianity in the end. There is a Muslim family, which is portrayed as anti-woman, violent, and intolerant. The Muslim also converts to Christianity. The Chinese exchange student (aka: communist) converts to Christianity. The whole class stands up and proclaims \"God is not dead\" (Yeah, just like in the chain email).So, yeah, the characters are one-dimensional, clich\u00e9, and almost offensive. Everyone converts to Christianity. I guess the makers of the film don't see the irony in making a movie that is supposed to portray Christians as accepting and friendly while at the same time trashing Muslims, atheist, and liberals. There are several other ways they could have gone if provoking critical thought where their goal. The professor and student could have shaken hands and agreed to disagree. The Maybe tone down on some of the offensive clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. Maybe actually present some atheist arguments that will challenge people's way of thinking instead of having the professor stand in the back and make smug remarks. Maybe not have it so the student wins over the entire class (Come on. Really?). This clearly wasn't their goal. It is Christian porn, plain and simple. The people in the theater were clapping like dumb apes whenever the brave Christian scored a point. Too Long; Didn't Read - Terrible movie even without the whole Christian agenda being shoved down your throat. Sharknado was better. Think about that.",

Not in the way that the producers probably intended, but I thought it was entertaining.Of course this movie is complete hogwash with conversations in the script that would never ever happen in real life. OK, where do I begin? As mentioned elsewhere on this page, atheists, for the most part, don't \"hate\" God...that would be like hating Santa Claus. And the argument that one can't be moral without Christianity...gimme a break. Has anyone ever heard of Aristotle? He wrote a book about ethics long before Christ trod the Earth. And finally, no professor would ever act like Kevin Sorbo's character. Anyone with a truly inquisitive mind would welcome a debate and no, Stephen Hawking is not consider \"infallible.\" You can't just bring up Hawking's name as proof of anything. Never been done. Never.Overall, this movie is about bashing what the producers see as militant atheism and secularism. Richard Dawkins is mentioned several times. And why anyone would get their life's philosophy from a dude who sells duck callers on TV I'll never understand. If you enjoy overwrought, wrong-headed religious melodrama with a sort of a dark and surprisingly nasty undertone, then God's Not Dead is for you.",

            "content": "I'm a Christian and just watched the movie last night. I have to tell you that this is NOT a good movie, at all. The only thing that was good about it was some of the acting and cinematography. The movie is so stereotypical, one-sided, and offensive that it will push many away from the gospel, which is not what any supposed Christian movie should be doing. I've talked to many non-Christians who have watched this film, and this is exactly what it's doing.Here's why. Every, and I mean every single non-Christian in the movie is an amoral, annoying, arrogant, jerk. Every single Christian (except that annoying girlfriend) is a moral, righteous, considerate person. Just because you are not a Christian doesn't mean you don't even have BASIC morals, I mean c'mon. That is completely stereotypical and will offend anyone who notices.Regarding the Muslim family, that just disgusted me. They only show one Muslim family, which so happens that the dad is an abusive father. This will probably cause any Muslim watching the movie to immediately step out in disgust. Sure, this may happen a lot in other countries and maybe even sometimes in the U.S., but they shouldn't have shown the only Muslim family in the entire movie as being abusive and dysfunctional. That alienates any Muslim in the audience as being dysfunctional. Way to love your neighbor, Mr. Director.In relation to the debate, the kid did give some good, foundational, basic points to support the existence of God in contrast to the atheistic Big Bang Theory. BUT, you NEVER heard a rebuttal of equal length or quality from the professor. If you watch any REAL debate done by professionals, each gets their shot to prove their point. And usually, both will bring up many very good points from each side of the spectrum. Sometimes the atheist will win, sometimes the theist will win. Depends on who's more prepared and logical. I, personally, am a completely convinced young-earth Creationist, so no, I'm not biased toward the professor. It just ticks me off that every time the professor talks, you immediately want to hate him from the sarcastic and arrogant tone he gives off while asking short, pithy, statements that can easily be disproven or argued by any professional Theist. This will alienate any Atheist in the room, and could, cause them to walk out in disgust as well. I would, if I was an Atheist.Next, they never tried to prove the existence of Jesus and the validity of the Christian religion. But, they turned around and completely dissed the Muslim religion with no validity to do so. They never even attempted to argue that the Jesus of the Christian Bible was the superior and only God, above Allah. Nope, they just mentioned God, as in a Supreme Being not necessarily relating to any one religion. And they expected you to already believe that Allah was a false god. What if a Muslim comes into the audience wanting to see a movie proving the existence of God in general?Lastly, the entire premise was a bunch of bull anyway. NO professor of that status would do that in a classroom. They would be stepping on glass, and probably get kicked out of the entire school very shortly. Most people are not atheists, most people are a mix of different religions. There's something called, freedom of speech. If he's violating that, he's out. And if, by some miracle, you do receive a tyrannical, insane professor like THAT, you don't let yourself get bullied like this kid did, and you don't just drop the class either. If you are a Christian, first of all, you stand up to the professor and read him your RIGHTS AS AN American CITIZEN. Voice your disgust to the classroom before you leave and threaten the teacher as you walk out telling him how you are going to bring this to the news and every board room you can get your hands on so that he will be fired as soon as possible because of his dictatorial unconstitutional leadership in the classroom. The last thing you do is give into his demands, and then JUST influence a little classroom of eighty people. With a professor that insane, you could get on the freaking news and tell the entire world the gospel. Why miss a chance like that? Think outside the box people! Also, it ticked me off that the entire reason that the professor was an Atheist was due to emotional, personal experience, rather than logic. I mean seriously? A lot of Atheists choose their viewpoints due to primarily logic and education rather than that their mom died, or something bad happened to them causing them to hate God and reject him by turning to Atheism. Once again, it is isolating Atheists as being emotional wrecks not truly wanting to accept what they know is true only because they HATE God. Which is a bunch of bull. It completely disregards any atheistic comments as being grounded in emotional problems, when many times they are grounded in what they call LOGIC. However faulty that logic may be.There are other points I could bring up, but I'm reaching my word-limit. This movie is in one word: mindless. And not something true Christians should be supporting. Now, once again, I am a reformed Christian young- earth, protestant Creationist and five-point Calvinist. I have argued with many atheists, agnostics, etc. and watched countless hours of debates and read many books from both sides of the spectrum and am totally convinced, due to LOGIC, not blind-faith, that God exists, Jesus exists, is the only true God, and that the Bible is infallible.",

            "content": "... when he said the movies are a great big empathy machine. At least in this case he probably was, because this film is a great big stereotype machine.I'll cut it some slack on acting and direction because the whole thing was shot in 20 days with probably a low budget. The screenplay itself, mainly focusing on the conflict between Christian student Josh Wheaton and his atheist philosophy professor, really has a narrow point of view. The film really paints everything with a black and white brush and makes assumptions about atheists - AND people from other faiths and countries - that cause much of the criticism of the Christian community in the first place. I know several atheists, and they are not all narcissists that abandon sick friends or people that blame God for some tragedy in their past. Many of them have a behavior code that exceeds that of Christians because they do not have a \"ticket to heaven in my pocket\" mentality which many Christians do have and I have observed.Meanwhile, we get a look at what is supposed to pass for a typical Arab-American Muslim household, as dad always makes sure that his daughter Ayisha has her face totally covered when he drops her off at school. He doesn't seem to mind that she has on short sleeves and clothes that are just as revealing as her peers. Note to dad - the face is not the only physical thing about a young lady that catches the eye of young men. No matter though, because as soon as dad is out of sight. Ayisha removes the face covering. It turns out that Ayisha is a closet Christian, and when dad finds out he reacts as we would expect any Muslim man to react who is three times his daughters size - he smacks her around fist to face and then physically throws her out into the street. Getting back to the film's main protagonist,Josh, he is now having to debate the philosophy prof in class as to the existence of God using philosophical arguments or else he will fail. The in-class debate part of the film was interesting, but I believe professor Raddison when he said they did not have pre-law at the university, because just about every action he took was completely illegal, from threatening his students with failing grades or at least greatly enhanced workloads if they did not write down \"God is dead\" on a piece of paper and sign it, to confronting and taunting the student Josh when he began to get his goat.Josh makes a big deal during his portion of the debate about God allowing free will to reign on earth and that being the reason for all of the evil, and then the plot goes on to disprove exactly that by implying divine destruction of the ignition capabilities of every car that two random missionaries on their way to Disneyland touch (in one of many sideplots) so that they can be at a particular place at a crucial time. As one missionary states to the other \"God has you exactly where he wants you\". What happened to free will if these two are just manipulated actors in God's grandiose play? Other interesting points - apparently all atheists turn to Christ when confronted with death (a point the late Christopher Hitchens disproves), and exactly what is this generic cancer that the atheist blogger has? Inquiring minds want to know. Plus - filmmakers - I know plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, but many of us know an \"I am Spartacus\" moment when we see it (Josh's argument in favor of the existence of God causes everybody in the class to stand and say \"God is not dead\"). The great irony here - the screenwriter for Spartacus was James Dalton Trumbo, who just happened to be an atheist. I would say this film is worth watching as a curiosity if nothing else.",

            "content": "I was curious to watch this movie. I have always been interested in these debates because, here in Europe, the absence of faith and the growing number of atheists is very visible. However, I was absolutely disgusted because of the huge bias with which everything is addressed. The film was made and sponsored by evangelical Christians, but note that they call themselves just Christians. It turns out that Christianity is much more vast and has long been divided into hundreds of independent churches, all of them Christian, though discordant to each other. So do not be surprised that many Christians do not share the point of view of that Christians. I am a Roman Catholic Christian and I do not agree with this movie.We cannot discuss faith because its something absolutely personal, but this movie brings us a debate in which God is exclusive property of a group of people: the evangelicals. However, if God is as our parents teach us, then He loves everyone and is the Lord of us all, even of those who do not believe in Him. The Muslims worship the same god as Christians but they were very mistreated in this film, along with atheists, who are truly diabolized. I know many atheists, but none of them are at war with God, as the teacher of this movie seems to be! Usually, they are very tolerant people, but they demand the right not to be converted by anyone to any faith and, we have to recognize, they have that right, and we, theists, have no right to judge them for it. The film, however, condemns and labels, which is ironic if we consider that the Bible is the first to warn against such judgments.To summarize, the film is a huge insult to all who do not identify themselves as evangelical Christians, but insults particularly the atheists, agnostics and Muslims. The script is a colossal piece of propaganda that backfired. The cast is a disgrace, everything is a disgrace. Ultimately, the awful quality of the final product can end up being a valid argument for us to praying to God for a miracle: the total disappearance of the film from the shelves and from our memories. If such a miracle happened, I would only regret not being able to call the Vatican to warn about it, but I would be happy to believe that this film never existed.",

It doesn't do anything necessarily bad to Christians but man they hit every wrong move you could think of in this movie.1. The story is a jumbled mess.For about thirty percent of the classes grade they have to write down on a piece of paper that God is Dead. The kid is is supposed to prove to his teacher that God's Not Dead when he was insulted by that. I'm sorry I've read the bible but honestly there is no way I can prove to someone that God is real. You could make arguments but not hard true facts. However I base my faith around Christianity for a different reason and this movie doesn't get that.2. The characters in this movie are offensive. If you're not a Christian in this movie your nothing more than a insidious, vile, repulsive jerk. Atheists in this movie are portrayed that way. I'm sorry but I have atheists friends but I'm not going to force my religion on them. Their faith is their business but they're not being selfish and mean spirited. The only good people in this are Christians but because of the actors they are so dull and uninteresting to watch.This is not a movie. This movie spends so little time on having conversations about these kind of topics and are instead just having tedious dialog sessions. Plus there are some questions that they never solved. Did the Muslim girl become homeless? Why are these kids taking this class that is a huge waste of time? Why hasn't anyone filed a lawsuit on the teacher that shouldn't waste his time on writing on a paper that God's Is Dead? Don't watch this movie.

I started to walk out, but I figured I would see the outcome which was predictable. This review is mostly about the closed mindedness of Christianity more than an actual review, but it touches on certain aspect that irritated me very much about this movie and generally Religious movies. I went mostly because I was curious about the Science vs Creation aspect of this film. First there are far too many different religions and branches of the same religion in this world. It's like finding a country club you like that suits your beliefs and accepts what others may consider a sin and you pick the one that best fits your beliefs. This is my biggest problem with organized religion. Are there going to be several million Asians in hell because the believe in Buddha. What about tribes in Africa that know nothing of the Bible or American Indians who have their own set of beliefs? I just can't fathom that a person who is kind, honest, and caring of others is going to Hell just because they don't go to the right church or worship in the approved manner. I was also disgusted with the portrayal of Atheist in this film. I have a few Atheist friends who would give you the shirt off their backs to help you if you needed it. They never discuss religion or push their beliefs on others. I have friends and family from all types of religious backgrounds, from Atheist to Pentecostals and they are not like any of these people portrayed in this movie. I thought that \"judgement\" was a sin, but I guess it depends on which \"God\" you believe in. Is one sin worse than another? The Bible is just a book written by MEN to control others. I would love for someone to explain to me how Noah got two of every animal on a Ark and managed to feed them. Where did he keep the sea life and freshwater creatures? Why didn't the lions and tigers eat the zebras and gazelles? Don't give me that answer about it was a \"miracle\". There is too much proof of evolution and facts to support the science behind evolving life forms and primitive species. I DO believe in faith, but it is more of a deep rooted feeling of security and love from family and friends that cause me to have the faith I have. I do not worship anyone or any idol, but I do worship life and a loving family an appreciate every aspect of it. It was tested very much in 2013 , but my faith brought my better half through from near death to healthy. Also, why is Jesus always portrayed as a white \"Hippie\" looking man? According to what little I do remember from reading the Bible, he was from a region where he definitely would have been dark skinned. The Bible even mentions that he had hair like wool. This brings me to believe that there was no way that Jesus was a white man. He would most likely have been a black man. These images of Jesus that are so common where designed when African Americans had no rights. Could you imagine a church putting up a picture of a Black Jesus in their sanctuary in the early 1900's. What about the parts of the bible that say we shouldn't eat shellfish or if our neighbor works on the sabbath, we should stone them to death? These seem like pretty archaic measures to me personally, but it's everyone's right to believe what they wish to believe in. I just think this movie portrays anyone who is not a Christian as a hell bound sinner and that in my opinion is \"Judgement\". This to me is the worst sin of all. I by no means judge anyone who is different than myself. I do not judge people on there beliefs, politics, or sexual orientation. I decide if I like someone based on their personality, kindness, and overall manners. I have friends from different cultural backgrounds and ethnicities . Some are Democrats and others are Republicans. Several go to church every Sunday. Just don't try to convince me to join your church or in some cases, your cult.

The music feels forced and crammed in just to make scenes more powerful than they are. Sometimes the music gets so overbearing and overused that's it's getting on your nerves. For some reason, the sound quality for this is pretty bad. Probably it was a low-budget production?The \"characters\" are just blunt stereotypes. In the main role, we have Josh Wheaton, who is played by Shane Harper. He's surprisingly good considering he has to play such a unbearable character. Bad for the first fifteen minutes, but then improved. He has a desire to make things so goddamn complicated instead of reporting the professor to the authorities like any sane individual would. I know I'm an atheist, but even I would get mad at someone coming up with such a idiotic idea like writing a report on God's supposed \"death\". And Wheaton's girlfriend (Can't remember her name) is a utter douche. Apparently the only thing that held together their relationship was him not talking in front of the class why God is real. It's dumb, but to break up with him for that single reason? Get lost.The cancer patient... What's her name? Who plays the character? Ah, whatever, all I know is that her acting all and out BLOWS. When she says \"You know I'm gonna die.\" she says it with no involvement at all. No expression, no change in tone, no sadness or anger depicted, nothing. It's incredible how somebody who has such a small role can f'uck up so much. Sure, when she wrecks the desk when she's angry about her cancer, we have what we can call okay acting, but otherwise, no. Anyway, she's a reporter.We also have a Chinese friend of Harper, and let me just say that every time he talks I want to shoot myself. That's how bad his acting is.Professor Radisson, who is played by Kevin Sorbo, is the worst of them though. Not in terms of acting, as Sorbo's acting is actually good. He has to be the best actor in the entire movie. So why did he waste his talent by starring in an utterly idiotic propaganda movie? The whole basis for his \"character\" is being an evil atheist who forces everybody to think the same as he does. Because apparently all atheists are total idiots with no respects for Christians.The depiction of the Muslim family is EMBARRASSING. The father is a firm Islamic believer who not only forces his daughter to wear a burqa, but also tries to keep her away from Christians. So what this movie wants to say is that all Muslims are intolerant of Christians? That's a very racist message, isn't it? And I don't understand what they are trying to prove when the daughter tries to convert to Christianity. Just because she hangs out with Christians, she wants to be one? That means this movie bluntly is stating their faith is the one and only, and everybody else's beliefs should be washed out!The dialog for this movie is shi't. Two characters repeat the phrase \"God is good\" every time they make some progress with a car they have trouble starting, tons of moralizing and worst of all, endless tacky debates about whether God is real or not. They seriously take up about 50 freaking percent of the movie and it's all repetitive, poorly argued and boring. Everything that has to do with God in the dialog (which is almost non-stop) is generalizing and yawn- inducing.The worst of all though... is the climax. Everybody becomes a Christian totally at random, just because they are sad and need support, or as in one case, because their life is at stake. And this is where the plot-hole arrives. How can Professor Radisson be an atheist if he suffered a childhood trauma with his mother dying in cancer, which made him hate God? So if he hates God, it means he still believes he exists, only that he loathes him. That means he was just struggling with faith, not struggling with people not agreeing with him. I mean, if he hates God, he could've been a satanist, but nooo, he had to be an atheist. That means this movie doesn't think atheism really exists, but is just people afraid to commit to God. And THAT, is where the movie is TRULY ignorant. Oh and the students in the classroom cheering at him when his arguments win over Harper's (which they very rarely do) is another plot hole as well. Why do they at first cheer on him, then suddenly turn over at Harper's side instead... FOR NO REASON? It's like they are watching \"God's Not Dead\" right in the movie \"God's Not Dead\", and suddenly are convinced that God exists.But you know what REALLY makes me want to rip my eyes out? The scene where the professor converts to Christianity! What's supposed to be a moving scene when Reverend Dave (played by David A.R. White, who is painful to watch) tries to make Radisson accept Jesus and Lord as his savior, feels more like a threat rather than thoughtful help. You could easily have added a knife in the Reverend's hand and they could have made it like \"HEY! Convert to Christianity, you dumb bitch, or I promise I'll slit your throat in the name of the God you don't believe!\" So what does this movie teach? All atheists are grumpy, evil bastards. Also, a moral compass is useless if you're not a Christian. Oh okay, I can rape, murder and engage in bestiality then, since I don't need to follow any morals. Good job, Harold CROCK.This is the worst movie that has been made in the history of cinema. Give this one a Raspberry Award for the worst screenplay ever. This is the most laughable propaganda you can imagine.",

The premise of the movie is that a college freshman has a philosophy class and the teacher makes all his students sign a form admitting that god is dead and out of a huge class one person refuses to sign and has to convince the teacher 'god isn't dead'. I'm almost positive if any teacher tried to do that in real life they would be immediately fired, and visa versa. This movie outright attacks anybody and everybody that isn't Christian and represents them as either terrible people or just plain stupid. The professor isn't an actual representation of an atheist either. He was a religious person whose mother died and now he is mad at this so called god. First of all, Atheists aren't mad at god, they don't believe in god. This movie tries to pass off Atheists as angry or stupid and it's the exact opposite. People that deny the existence of god came to that conclusion because through logic and reasoning. All this movie is is propaganda for believers that hate on people that don't think the same way they do. This movie also tries to tell viewers that Christianity is a minority and is being attacked even though it is the exact opposite. My mother now believes that all college professors have an agenda to recruit college kids to be atheists. The most absurd thing I've ever heard. This movie is such a sham and Christians should be embarrassed that this movie was ever even released. Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are rich white Christians in the bible belt that will praise this movie to the end of the days and I just find that sad. The fact that this movie currently has a 4.8 in viewer rating restores some of my faith in humanity because I am disgusted that something as stupid as this was even made.",

            "content": "This travesty of a movie movie is about a Christian named Josh Wheaton who attends a philosophy class at his college/university. As we all know, Christians are a significant minority in the United States (sarcasm), so Josh is the only implied Christian out of all 80 students in the class. The professor is a ridiculously exaggerated atheist and forces all of his students to write on a piece of paper \"God is Dead\" with a signature beneath it; because, you know, that's totally allowed in schools and wouldn't result in immediate punishment.Of course, Josh, being the only devout Christian (as far as we're aware) out of all 80 students in the classroom and every single class the professor has ever taught before, is the only one to say he won't do it. The professor then says he will be forced to debate and prove God is real and that he's \"not dead.\" Of course, the movie seems to not understand the word debate as Josh is the only one to actually argue anything, while the professor doesn't do more than one or two snarky rebuttals; so really, it's more like \"I'll give you the chance to argue everything while I do nothing to deliver an argument against it.\"Meanwhile, we follow several other stories; most significantly, that of a Muslim girl who is violently abused by her father when she wants to convert to being a Christian, which sends a horrible message and stereotype about Muslims in addition to atheists. We also follow a vegan atheist (trying to aim for the most liberal characters possible?) who finds out she has cancer and ends up following Christ in the end, surprisingly (not). Intertwined with this is her laughably mean-spirited and rude atheist lawyer boyfriend, who, when finding out about her cancer, says in hilariously evil fashion \"Couldn't this wait until tomorrow?\" which drew a plethora of shocked gasps throughout the crowd as well. This character in particular was exaggerated to such a point that it made me sick.The funniest thing about those other stories is that they serve literally no purpose whatsoever other than to show that everyone who isn't a Christian is an incredibly angry, mean, or otherwise confused person. They contribute nothing to the plot at all besides filler for the spaces in between the \"main event\" that is Josh arguing in favor of God.Speaking of useless to the plot, there is also a few parts of the movie the movie that are just random where a black man who sounds like he's a Caribbean native and the Reverend at Josh's church stand around a parking lot for two days and deliver some unfunny commentary about how loving God is and how every rental car they get doesn't drive. I couldn't really understand anything this did to help carry the story along besides, again, acting as filler for breaks in-between the actual plot line.In the end Josh begins yelling at his professor random lines that completely bypass everything he said in his arguments before (the most random one was \"science supports his existence, you know the truth!\" despite nothing before that point saying anything like that) and it turns out that the only reason the professor is atheist is because he lost his mom when he was a kid, implying the only reason atheists don't believe is because they lost something in their lives.Of course, that part doesn't make any sense because the atheist lawyer actually talks to his dementia-stricken mother soon after this scene bringing up how he's so rich and successful despite the fact that he's an atheist and she's a poor old women with a mental deficiency despite the fact that she is a devout Christian. So basically, we have one side saying atheists are atheists because they are just angry or sad to appease Christians that they don't actually believe for realistic reasons, and then we have the atheist lawyer go completely against this point just to remind everyone that atheists are horrible people.So, after he was yelled at by Josh, Professor Radison reads a letter from his mother talking about how much she loved him and how she wanted him to be a good follower of God. After this Radison rushes to a concert where his Christian girlfriend is to get her back. All of this makes us assume he reconsidered his faith and has become a Christian again. Or not, because on the way he is hit by a car.The Reverend sees him get hit and, without ever knowing or meeting this character, instead of screaming for help, getting paramedics, calling 911, anything, they begin talking to him about his faith in Jesus. Yes, folks, I'm serious. The Reverend says it's a miracle the professor wasn't killed instantly! Of course, the professor dies anyway so really he ended up dying painfully and slowly, while also being forced to admit out loud to having faith in Jesus before his death.This almost made me leave the theatre in disgust. What makes the situation even worse is that no one cared! The Reverend and his friend were joking about how he's in heaven now anyway! Not to mention half the theatre had laughed at him being hit by a car. It was sickening and disturbing that someone's death in the movie was simply shrugged at because he was an atheist and had repented in the end so it didn't matter anyway.In the end, if I were to ignore all of the awful stereotypes, disgusting pieces of Christian propaganda, and in general just insulting content, the movie would still be a 5/10 at best. The acting was weak, half of the film had zero to do with the main plot, and the main plot itself was hardly even compelling and completely unrealistic anyway. Avoid at all costs.",

            "content": "American movies deal with virtually all areas of everyday life, but one aspect they never seem to get around to tackling very much is religion. In fact, if you were an alien from outer space and all you knew about American life came from the movies, you might be forgiven for coming away with the impression that spirituality and religion played little to no part in it. And you don't have to even be a religious person to be bothered by this oversight. Yet, apart from the occasional religious fanatic in a horror film (usually an exorcist or a serial killer or a knockoff of Carrie's mom) or a well-meaning but misguided Bible- thumping rube in the odd independent feature, religious characters are virtually no en casa when it comes to the American movie scene. (In all fairness, atheists do not fare any better when it comes to Hollywood happenings, since they are invariably forced to convert to theism of at least some sort after being shown the error of their ways). Apparently, now, however, there is a movement of sorts, mainly among evangelical Protestant filmmakers, to rectify this situation. And while that's an admirable goal in and of itself, a movie like \"God's Not Dead\" is clearly not the answer. Apart from its amateurishness of script, production and acting, \"God's Not Dead\" seems mainly concerned that the audience come away with the impression that the whole secular world is out to \"get\" Christians, exemplified by a truly embarrassing scene in which a snotty liberal reporter attempts to ambush the infinitely patient \"Duck Dynasty\" star Willie Robertson over his religious faith. Rest assured, however, the reporter gets her divine comeuppance by being struck down by a fatal disease, so everything turns out all right in the end.This theme plays itself out most fully in the central conflict, as a clean-cut, green-around-the-gills Christian freshman goes head-to- head with an obnoxious philosophy professor who insists that all his students sign a pledge at the beginning of the semester declaring in no uncertain terms that God is dead. After the youngster refuses to compromise his faith, the Prof makes the fatal mistake of allowing him to make his case to the class, smug in his certainty that the boy will flame out and be shamed into admitting that the teacher was right all along. Thus, Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper) and Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) go round-and-round in a series of lectures and debates, with Wheaton getting all the good lines and compelling arguments (though the professor does get the better podium) till, of course, Wheaton has inspired the entire class to rise up out of their seats and to declare in unison \"God's not dead,\" while the pro, with all his book- larnin', is left a quivering mass amidst the smoldering ruin of what was once his atheistic domain. We're somehow supposed to believe that this seasoned scholar and certified atheist hasn't heard any of these supposedly iron-clad, full-proof theistic arguments before, and that he wouldn't have more compelling arrows in his own quiver with which to shoot them down. (Interestingly, Wheaton is clearly no young earth creationist since he argues for a theistic explanation for both the Big Bang and evolution, a fact that might not actually sit all that well with a fairly large chunk of the movie's target audience). In truth, it's really not all that surprising that the professor is not afforded a fair hearing because \"God's Not Dead\" is not interested in having an honest debate about the issues; what it wants is to set up, then effortlessly knock down, as many straw men (i.e., nonbelievers) as it can on its way to winning the argument. Radisson, for instance, is a raving caricature of a \"liberal\" college professor: arrogant, self- righteous, and eager to crush dissent in the classroom he runs like a petty dictator. He even verbally abuses his meek Christian girlfriend (a former student of his, of course, but, then again, you know how these decadent lefty academics are!), and thinks nothing of verbally dressing her down in front of his equally snooty colleagues for her religious beliefs (if he had a mustache, I'm sure he'd twirl it).The problem with \"God's Not Dead\" is not that it has a pro-Christian message; it's that it feels the need to deliver that message by putting everybody else down that's the problem. It even gets its digs in at Islam, in an under-developed subplot (all the subplots are under- developed, actually) involving a young new convert to Christianity whose super-devout Muslim father physically abuses then disowns her when he learns of her \"betrayal\" (as if many Christian parents haven't reacted in similar fashion when informed that their children are gay or have become unbelievers, for example). Would the filmmakers (Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman wrote it and Harold Cronk directed it) be so quick to judge a parent if the situation were reversed?It's no big revelation to say that dramas regularly use manipulation to varying degrees to try to win audiences over to their side, so there is nothing inherently wrong with what \"God's Not Dead\" is trying to do. It's just that it does so on such a cheesy and simple-minded level (the last 15 minutes or so really have to be seen to be believed) that it actually winds up driving away the very people it is trying to persuade. As it stands, if \"God's Not Dead\" is any indication of their average output, Christian filmmakers are really going to have to step up their game if they hope one day to be able to compete in the big leagues.",

            "content": "As a film that is overly religious, Altmanesque (minus the overlapping dialogue), and structured almost similar to 2005's Crash (which was I believe was inspired by Robert Altman himself), God's Not Dead is a March release that presents the debate of Christianity vs. agnosticism. In other words, the major conflict here involves a college student trying to convince a philosophy class that God is real whereas the professor of said class believes that God well, does not exist. As things progress, other characters eventually filter in, their lives intersect each other ever so slightly, and events finally conclude with a chance meeting at a concert involving a popular Christian rock band.Now if you haven't taken in a viewing, know this: God's Not Dead is controversial, will allow for debate, and despite its PG rating, might sensitize an audience with its subject matter (doesn't matter if you're 10 years old or 80 years old). Whether or not that's a good or bad thing, I still found the film to be very well done, well paced, and well acted (especially by the leads being Kevin Sorbo and Shane Harper). It hasn't however, gotten a very wide release and at times, resembles a TV movie or something you would show as educational fodder in church classrooms. But it's as intelligent and thought provoking as anything to come out so far in 2014. And the fact that it wasn't another shoot em' up, another cartoon, or another lowbrow comedy was very refreshing to me.Filmed entirely in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and featuring a cameo involving members of TVs smash hit, Duck Dynasty, God's Not Dead focuses on law student Josh Wheaton (played impressively by Shane Harper). He's a devout Christian, a loyal boyfriend, and overly smart (yet at times, timid). When he's warned about taking a philosophy class taught by a stern, set in his ways professor named Radisson (played with a searing glare by Kevin Sorbo), Wheaton decides to go against the grain and take this agnostic teacher to task (using at times, a power point presentation). He challenges Professor Radisson to a debate on whether or not God is real. This all happens because Josh won't sign a note saying that he denounces God's existence so that he can continue to take said class like everyone else.As a highlight, there are three to four key scenes between these two actors that are very powerful. Added to that, the secondary characters mentioned earlier, also contribute to the story as well. They are all connected through 1-3 degrees of separation by the protagonist (Wheaton) and the antagonist (Radisson). One of them is a writer who finds out that she has cancer thereby trying to find solitude with God. Another character belongs to an old fashioned family who alienates her because of her beliefs. Finally, there is a nasty businessman played by veteran Dean Cain (Mark). He has a perfect life yet admits that he's a bad person and wonders why he hasn't been taken from the world yet (his mother is dying of dementia and is as good as any human being who has ever lived).In conclusion, God's Not Dead comes off as a little preachy. It does at times, project itself as a public service announcement or an infomercial posing as a movie. However, just when you're not expecting it, the film sneaks up on you and packs an emotional wallop. A couple of the character portrayals are very heartbreaking and this is the glue that holds things together. The script, which has the collaboration of five writers, walks a tight wire between cleverness and textbook reading material. It's okay though because the actors pull you through, the story lines thread naturally, and the aspect of epiphany fully arises. God's Not Dead is no masterpiece but it's worth a solid recommendation. It's \"not\" playing at a whole lot of theaters right now so if you are in its cinematic vicinity, you should give it a serious look-see.",

But, this speaks more to the absurdity of the film director's cheap shot at the professor of philosophy who was cast as the pi\u00f1ata and surrogate for all liberal elites, aka, the godless ones.Radisson would have failed his freshman's college course in logic 101 with that answer. Yet, it puts into question why any reputable university would neglect to check the academic credentials of a professor so ill-qualified to teach any course, let alone philosophy.Of course, the story line of this Either/Or movie was fiction, not reality.A film that drags in references to arch liberal-haters and bigots like Franklin Graham and Duck Dynasty's Willie Robertson can't be all that serious about a discussion of God's existence. The film is a dog whistle that reinforces deity-stamped fixed beliefs while dismissing and disparaging all things related to scientific explanations and inquiry, whether of this world or another.If one's faith is inviolable then of course all the answers for the Josh Wheatons are in the Book of Genesis which multitudes believe declares that everything was formed out of nothing at exactly the same time 6,000 years ago, men and dinosaurs coexisted and evolution never occurred.Also, those \"godless\" scientists (all presumed to be secular humanists), 97% of whom have proved through testing and peer reviewed research and factual data that global warming is occurring. But those of faith know and insist that it is just a liberal hoax.How ironic it is that God would play such a cruel trick on so many scientists who actually test their evidence! Consider this section from the Texas 2012 Republican platform: \"Knowledge-Based Education \u2013 We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student's fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.\" Imagine that, challenging a student's fixed beliefs! Imagine, encouraging critical thinking skills! Blasphemy! This film, along with its pathetic tableau of stereotypes, underscores the closed-minded view that if God/Jesus is your favorite philosopher then there is no need to venture into the imperfect world of knowledge-seeking and mundane issues.Especially at the fictitious Hadleigh University where one of its esteemed professors and educators, Professor Radisson, would have flunked freshman logic in a real institution of higher learning who was laughably pilloried by the all-knowing college sophomore Josh Wheaton.Near the end of this movie Professor Radisson is struck by a hit-and-run driver, also God's plan?, and dies minutes later gurgling something about a higher power. What a fitting metaphor for this astonishingly vapid piece of science fiction that belongs more appropriately under the tire treads of the car and its hit-and-run driver that sped away from reality.",

            "content": "The following review is from a orthodox, fundamentalist, born-again, filled-with-the-Holy Spirit, water baptized, sanctified, stereotypical Christian.It is ironic that a movie like 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' can deliver so inspiring a masterpiece of cinematic artistry and masterful story telling, and yet be about relatively nothing, (except that the end credits suggest a homage to the Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig) and, at the same time, the film 'God is Not Dead', with such an important message, is anything but a vehicle of insightful and inspiring cinematic story telling. But gone are the days of 'Inherit the Wind', Elmer Gantry, and Ben-Hur.Rather, I got what I expected: The typical 'Trinity Broadcast endorsed' attempt to show an unbelieving world the reality of God. And it does this with the very familiar 'three-subplot device' with the main story dispersed equally throughout. Non-believers will be offended, most likely, as their supposed arguments for the non-existence of God are dismantled by a freshman student who is challenged by his philosopher professor (who is a God hating, self-described atheist) to present a rebuttal to his philosophical assertions.The title of the film is certainly a philosophical challenge to those who are atheists and to those who might be curious. But it is more an inspirational film for Christians who have accepted the Bible than it is a evangelical device.Its characters are basically stereotypical so to make it simple. (Complex people don't exist anyway). And at the end we are treated to a Christian Rock Concert just after the main antagonist is run over by a speeding car (depicted rather graphically). Though I was glad to see him repent on his death asphalt,something just didn't quite fit when the next shot is a horde of Christians rocking out at a concert.In any philosophical or evangelical attempt to justify a belief in God, you should never stack the deck. (Hear that Ray Comfort.) Stringent non-believers will only have more ammo under their belt after seeing this hackneyed contrivance. For Example:Student to professor, \"Then how can you hate something that doesn't exist\"? (referring to God). The professor stands silently frozen in philosophical quandary as the students gasp, and the movie observers applaud. All he had to say was: \"Because I hated what I then began to realize was wishful thinking . . . what I now am convinced is but a lie.\" Instead, the film rests on the first scenario as being an illustration of profound philosophical argumentation. How embarrassing. I am sick of seeing the Christian faith so belittled. Especially when the title is most likely used as an attempt to lure in the skeptic.You can't bring a thinking man to Christ by setting him up argumentatively. This is what this movie does. Yes, God is not dead, except in the minds of certain movie makers desiring to make a profit on the 'God' issue.",

            "content": "This will be an unusual review, tying the film in to other cultural phenomena. I will also be discussing a short film, which THIS movie seems to be based on, and the probable original story.The best parts in \"God's Not Dead\" are the lecture-hall interactions between the Christian Student, and the Atheistic professor. The way the film was unfolding, I thought the kid was going to be just Bible thumping. But his intellectual engagement of the hostile professor kept me interested. The students remarks were not of the straw-man variety.So, if you go for those brief high points in the story, you will be satisfied.The Christian experience today is as diverse as modern life itself. And this movie shows that. The acting was a little forced, but we really see modern Christians for the puzzling bunch that we are. One Christian sister is having an affair with a professor, another lives with her Moslem family, and too scared to come out. An American pastor is wishing to be on \"the front lines\" like his missionary buddy, not realizing that he is being kept very busy where he is. A Duck Dynasty look-alike has a wife dressed like a sexy model. And the lead character, \"Josh,\" has a 6-year relationship with a cutesy girl, who doesn't give a rip about his Christian Faith. Only the visiting missionary seems to have his head on straight. With a little tweaking, this story could have been produced by enemies of Christianity.There is a drumbeat of reality in the undercurrent of this story. Christian life is profoundly influenced by the Hand of Divine Providence. Unbelievers won't get it. Even in the face of unfathomable hardship, we will be lifted by unexpected turns of good fortune, the timing of which is interpreted as instruments for getting the attention of the believer. Though this occurs throughout the story, practicing Christians will notice it effortlessly, while the non-believer will find it all very odd. Watch for that golden moment when the business executive visits his dementia mother, and she starts preaching out of the wild blue. The sequence has a nice snapper at the end.There is a hostile mood emerging in the USA at this time on history, directed against Christianity. The film manages to give us a taste of that too.So, everyone is given a chance to be human here. And they all converge at a Christian Rock concert at the end. That part did not appeal to me, since my branch of the faith doesn't get into that, as though The Messiah is accessible through rock concerts, lighting gimmicks and star-power. Yup, we have our differences among us. Being a writer myself, I suspect these writers must have groped for some element to pull it all together. Thinking I saw enough, I left the theater during the rock concert sequence, only to learn later that there is another closing development which I had missed by leaving.Nice touch among many: When the Moslem dad picks up his daughter from school, note the labeling around the curb where she boards.This film is light, enjoyable, thought-provoking, annoying in its stereo types, yet spot-on for casting the diversity of the Christian experience.I wonder whether anyone else mentioned the relationship of this story to an obscure short Christian film called \"Chalk\". Look on you tube for the title in quotes: \"Chalk (short Christian film)\" for the dramatization. Under another YouTube titled \"The Chalk\" (a poorly conceived retelling of the Chalk story, using only text and music track), a blogger writes: \"The story is a variation of a real story. The student was Richard Harvey and the professor was Dr. Lee. It happened in a Chemistry class at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania in the 1920's. However, Dr. Lee was a deist who annually lectured against prayers... with a glass flask (not chalk). That day Richard offered to pray and the professor dropped the flask and it rolled off his shoe to the floor without damage.\" In conclusion: The standoff of believers vs. non-believers is an old one. This little film is a nice snapshot in time. While it was entertaining enough for me, hostile \"take-no-prisoners\" reviewers will find plenty to whine about.",

In a nutshell philosophy is questions that can never be answered and religion is answers that can never be questioned. The movie creates a straw-man by casting the philosopher as more dogmatic than religion. I've never heard of a philosophy professor coercing students into a position because at its core philosophy is about free inquiry. Philosophers consider Argument from Authority a fallacy. Philosophy is about teaching what great minds thought and to get students to think for themselves. My philosophy professor was atheist but we spent just as much time studying Christian apologetics as criticism. We were expected to understand the arguments both ways.",

Far right wing ultra Christian hate film pretending to be a debate.It plays to an audience of people who are already brainwashed into believing in the supernatural that requires no deep thought. In the movie everyone who is not Christian is evil, stupid, misguided or hellbent on destroying Christianity.The atheist professor of course is forcing people to declare god is dead and threatens to fail a Christian student because he won't sign a statement saying as much which of course is completely illegal. The funniest part being when the Christian student is told he better stop embarrassing the professor with all his god knowledge, hilarious.The one Muslim is evil and mean and beats his daughter because she of course wants to leave Islam for Christianity.The Christians are all very kind and righteous but everyone else is horrible and their lives are miserable because they have not found Jesus.Another funny idea is that somehow Christians are the persecuted ones, full of kindness and love for all, when in reality they are the most bigoted, racist and two faced people around.They even have a cameo by one of the Duck Dynasty racist Jesus freaks.In the end they of course don't prove that god is any more real than a fairy tale. They just bring up tired old nonsense that's been debunked by science long ago. The embarrassing ending where everyone agrees god is not dead is a Christian fantasy.Don't expose children to this cult like propaganda. It's dangerous.In the list of atheist philosophers in the class they include Richard Dawkins simply because he is public enemy number one of uber Christian cultists, but he is not a philosopher.",

Otherwise they must attend some magically awful colleges with so many stereotypical teachers. Are there on earth such many awful immoral non-believers in the society? Of course not. It is true that there are bad people like the lawyer and the professor in the movie; but those are very extreme cases, almost impossible. However authors can create these stereotypical characters out of reality; and that's why I say this movie is Magic Realism.I'm a graduate student from China and I was converted as a catholic 4 year ago. Ironically, there is a Chinese guy in this movie, and he is converted by Josh. I can't understand it. If I watched this movie before my baptism, the hope that I receive from Christianly will collapse.According to my experience, if a professor forces his students to say that God is dead, he can be reported and very likely gets fired. And what about the lawyer? His is a jerk because he is a jerk; there's nothing to do with his atheism. The movie doesn't prove anything.Before I heard \"how can you hate something that doesn't even exist?\" I already knew this line. I almost laughed. Where did I learn this line\"? Ironically, philosophy. Philosophy of leaving and death. The original line is like this: say you are sure about your death; but if you do not even existed, how are you sure about your death? In short, this line is not new at all.Let talk about the Muslim family. I got shock when I saw the girl when to the Muslim girl and say \"you're beautiful; you don't have to wear that.\" I reality, that line will cause a big religious issue. And at the end of the movie, her father just threw her out of home without saying a single word. Moreover, there's no following-ups to the Muslim girl's life; she just simply went to the concert. I wonder who purchased a ticket for her since she did not have her wallet with her when she was thrown out.Anyway this movie is so offensive to non-Christians. I have many good atheist friends, they are all good people. I'm sure they will be so offended after seeing this movie. I know we are Christians, but we have to be nice and merciful to non-believers; instead of hit him by a car and tell him to accept Jesus when he is endangered.Basically, I feel like the story makers are trying to assume that non-believers are all fools; only blind-faith are what God wants. It that true that God want them to defend His dignity against professors, rich mans and other atheists? No. Instead, Jesus told us to obey, forgive, and respect. The movie fails to achieve that.",

            "content": "The interconnecting story is about a few people having issues about their faith, but at the main focus is Josh's story, a freshman college student not giving up to his professor's demand of a unanimous concession of written statements declaring God is dead. The professor gives Josh 3 20-minute lecture to disproof God's dead. By a reverend, Josh was referred to Matthew 10:32-33 and Luke 12:48, verses encouraging believers to defend his/her believe in front of others. Josh takes up the task, enduring his girlfriend breaking up with him over it.There are also the other stories of an anti-god reporter who's diagnosed of having cancer, whose boyfriend is an uncaring person. The boyfriend's mother, although she has been a good Christian all her life, now suffers dementia. The boyfriend's sister, a devout Christian, is having a relationship with Josh's atheist professor. The sister turns out to be a congregation member of the reverend who advised Josh on the verses. Also there are Josh's fellow students a male Chinese who ends up deciding to follow Jesus, and a Middle-Eastern descent girl, who has secretly converted as a Christian, confronts the moment of truth with her family.Josh takes up the three lectures and at the final lecture convinced the rest of his class, all but his professor, that God is not dead. The finale sums at a Christian music concert where Newsboys are playing. All the Christian characters gather there. Josh's atheist professor gets an rejuvenation and tries to go to the concert but is struck by a hit and run driver. The reverend happens to be at the place, and learning that the professor is not going to make it, asks him to repent and accept Jesus as his Lord and Saviour, which the professor painful does.The basic story is interesting. In my opinion the center story of Josh's battle against his professor is a strong story to tell to believers now. Yes I agree that movies which relive the biblical stories and accounts are important to help believers to have somewhat a visual anchor on them, but I also deem that movies with contemporary stories like this are as important to help prepare believers face what the world has in store for them to seduce them into denying Jesus. Of course there are many similar take on Christian cable TV channels, but there are rarely that is well and throughly planned, executed, and distributed as wide as movies.From a movie viewers side, I agree that the movie quality is not really that great. A cast of newcomers and B-list veterans don't really make the audience to have a high expectation. As did Heaven Is for Real (2014), the story alone is what keeps this movie still enjoyable. The acting overall is just a bit below the average. Individually, only the acts from Kevin Sorbo and Shane Harper that felt real, although Sorbo gets a little over at highly emotional scenes.The execution in editing and camera angle is a so-so and average, just playing it safe while focusing more on the story. But what I find interesting is that this movie doesn't depict a miracle as hyperbolic as other movies do. It keeps a loophole where doubt and disbelieve can take place. It's for me a good thing because miracles are worth believing if we keep our faith facing the mystery that comes with it, and not yielding to doubts and disbelieve.You may or may not agree with me, but overall for me it's an 8 out of 10 scoring movie, just out of the center story of steadfastness and courage in the face of adversity in defending one's own faith righteously in God's way, not through force, but through letting others see the living God in us through our daily lives. A recommendation is without doubt a yes.",

All the atheists are portrayed as morally corrupt, Muslims are portrayed as purveyors of domestic violence and Christians are perverted into divine agents of God with a mission to convert the heathens. The movie has zero respect for the concept of tolerance, instead pursuing a sick mission to remind the viewer that everybody other then true believing Christians are people who are sick in the head.I find myself in an interesting position when it comes to faith. I am an agnostic who grew up of mixed Jewish and Christian heritage. I was also in a relationship for many years with a non-practicing Muslim woman. My mother is a staunch atheist. So I have been exposed to all of the major faiths and arguments one way or another. In each I have seen the tolerant and the intolerant. It is intolerance that gives rise to the evils of this world. Terrorism, violence, racism and so on are all borne out of it, and it really doesn't matter what faith or background you have, once you stereotype another you are a purveyor of hate. That is exactly who the makers of this movie are. Love thy neighbour is an alien concept to them. Demonise and convert thy neighbour is their motto, and I know full well from my own Christian friends that true Christians are peaceful and tolerant of others. Those people claiming to be Christians who are writing glowing reviews of this utter dross might spare some time to stop and think about that.I am a tolerant person so I believe in the rights of all to express themselves, however abhorrent I find their views.

Radisson is a radical atheist and demands all the students sign a pledge that \"God is Dead\". Everybody signs but Josh refuses. Josh suggests that the class judge his arguments and Radisson gives him 3 sessions. His girlfriend Kara forbids him to risk his grades. Reverend Dave gives some encouragement and he decides to give it a try. Ayisha is a young Muslim woman trying to obey her conservative father Misrab while struggling to live in the modern world and her burgeoning Christianity. Amy Ryan is a young aggressive blogger hounding the religious. She finds out that she has cancer and is promptly dumped by her arrogant lawyer boyfriend Marc Shelley (Dean Cain). Marc's sister Mina is Radisson's Christian girlfriend and former student.Radisson is so ridiculous that he is a cartoon villain. He is literally a villain with a God complex. Not only does he hate God but he actually says he's God in the classroom. That's fine for an action thriller or a comic book movie. The problem is that everything sounds fake. It's a little problematic for a serious discussion. It's an even bigger problem if the movie hopes to reach anybody other than the most cloistered faithful. This is the definition of preaching to the choir. The choir will eat this up but I'm not sure anybody else will.Despite Shane Harper being a less than charismatic actor, his underdog character is actually very compelling. The girlfriend is an interesting character but there are a whole cast of other superfluous characters. The movie really needs to zero in on Josh and his story. I like the argument in class and his struggle outside of class. The movie needs to be about Josh. Amy Ryan and Marc Shelley are ridiculous. At least they're more interesting than Reverend Dave. I have no idea why the movie spends so much time with the dead car. I'm sure the reverend would have a great sermon about it but it doesn't make for good storytelling. Ayisha's story is interesting but she needs to be better tied in to Josh. Martin Yip is in a similar situation but at least he has a couple scenes with Josh. For the discussion in class, I do find them fascinating. It is obviously one sided but fascinating nevertheless. Imagine if Radisson is an actual human character, their debate would sound so much more compelling. The movie really doesn't need everybody to stand up for God in the class at the end. It would actually be more powerful with half and half. It means that the students are more than simple sheep following whoever is willing to lead them. If the students are smart, then Josh's victory would be so much greater and sweeter. I think a battle between an atheist professor and a religious student could be a compelling story especially if it's done with the sole purpose of being a good story.I don't expect much love for my sincere review with 60% of the people rating this movie either a 10 or a 1.

In a way this movie is a revelation and a threat to every modern persons value system. I always look for a movie to contrast with one and the best movie to contrast this one with is \"Pay It Forward.\" There is a very good reason for this.\"Pay It Forward\" is a total reflection on the crass modern society we live in. A whole lot of people believe throwing lots on money at problems will always make them go away. It is the modern standard bearer of today's Western Social Values in the United States. Think of the \"Income Redistribution\" policy currently popular in this country. God's Not Dead challenges this convention as this movie is about faith as the answer to problems. The class room sequence reminds one of the old television series \"The Paper Chase\" as it has the Professor battling against GOD in his classroom.You can easily dismiss this film by being Anti-Christian and Anti-God. If you do that your making an error. This movie makes some major comments on why there are many of the problems we have currently. The characters, while sometimes a bit shallow and card board very much resemble a lot of the worst people I have met in my life. There is a bit of comedy thrown in, not big laughs but the type of thing to create a smile.Take you hanker because you will need it if like me you find how pitiful some of the people are in the movie hit you as they hit me, you will cry. I cry even harder if I think of the real people who I know that they are very much like them. I have found the only cure for getting these kind of people out of my life is to move on and move them out of it. You can not change those who can not be changed. That sums up everybody who feels threatened by this movie. It makes them uncomfortable because they see themselves and their whole value system being challenged.The credits of the film are very revealing in that a lot of research was done on the many cases of education versus religion in colleges done in writing this script.

It'd be wonderful to see that we have learned from our mistakes, through thousands of years, a millions attempts to achieve improvement, and seek some of time of enlightenment. Instead, it looks like we're regressing into the middle and dark ages, and I thought I was going to see a human being either crucified or burned at the stake while I was sitting in the audience.Nothing is more thrilling that being able to connect with some time of sublime or divine entity when seeing a work of art, in this case a good movie. There's plenty of opportunity for disappointment in the world (inside and outside the theater), so seeing a wonderful film is definitely a treat. Reaching a higher plane, feeling better, experiencing love and the sense of brotherhood, a uniting force in the universe is an unexpected treat. None of that happens in this film. You will feel beaten, disgusted, ostracized, and will learn of new ways to hate your fellow human being. I found some elements pretty the disturbing, as the fact that entire cultures or civilizations are regarded as having a mistaken point of view and unable to experience love and respect. The attack on Science is even more upsetting because there appears to be no even an attempt at understanding how matter behaves, the laws of physics apply, and how the progress health has made over the years have saved more than a few lives. Apparently, the concept of time being elastic and open to interpretation would even make Einstein dizzy since people can just assume whatever they want in order to prove a point.Worse, it's the fact that reality has no place in the narrative here. Suspension of disbelief appears to be mistaken for faith as the young girl finds herself in the middle of a concert, hours after being kicked from her home. Whatever love is in her heart (if there's any) has evaporated, and she's as bad as the people who failed to understand her. Except she's to be admired where his dad is an evil figure.The gimmick with the cars became tiresome and jokey. There could have been more imaginative ways to lead some of the main characters to cross paths. People are still talking about \"Lost\" where no one really understood how the forces of nature, spiritual beings, and science truly came together, but there was a glow that no one could deny in the final scene, and people were not hurling insults or put downs at each other.Truly, the climatic scene in the classroom felt almost like revisiting the Salem trials or watching the Inquisition unleash its poison on unsuspecting victims. There was no attempt to offer a helping hand, instead, it seemed like a weapon, and words can be pretty hurtful were more appropriate.If there was anyone who surpassed the ridiculous black and white nature of this story was the philosophy professor, who at least puts himself through the self-torture of not knowing how to look at pain. He's portrayed as a deplorable human being at first, but I found the student a more despicable figure because he has not grown into a more self- realized human being despite his proclamation. Where is the love that the historical figure preached we should practice? Instead there's only a purpose of division, separatism, racism, pure hatred, and egotism that leaves us exhausted and truly afraid that the title might not really be a misprint or misguided idea.Stay away if you can, or you might get your soul killed with by this film.",

The student basically accepts the theories of evolution and the Big Bang, but insists that there must be a god since science doesn't explain everything. He also claims that religion is necessary for morality (no secular counterargument is offered). In the end, his goal is to get the professor to allow students to decide the existence of their god for themselves.While I support the idea of being free to decide whether to believe in a god or not, the rest of the plot line of this movie is loaded with Christian arrogance. A Moslem woman gets kicked out of her home by her father for being a secret Christian without any discussion, a unlikely scenario. The father is simply portrayed a rigid and intolerant. The Christian minister she's been listening to is Franklin Graham. The fact that Graham is a rabid Islamophobe is never mentioned.Meanwhile, an atheist blog reporter learns she has advanced stage cancer. Her boyfriend heartlessly abandons her when she tells him about her condition. She is portrayed as all alone with no friends until she tells some Christian rock singers she came to interview about her diagnosis. They convince her to \"accept Jesus.\" Finally, when pressed by the student, the philosophy professor admits he became an atheist because of the death of his Christian mother from cancer, as if people lose their religion only due to traumatic events. As he is having second thoughts about his atheism and is on his way to the Christian rock concert, where all the new Christians appear to be heading, including a Chinese student who became a Christian against his father's wishes, the professor is struck by a hit-and-run driver. A Christian minister on the scene convinces the professor to become a Christian on his deathbed.The message of the movie seems to be that once people \"learn about Jesus\" or in times of crisis, they'll become Christian and never again question the existence of the Christian god. (But only it they're Moslems or atheists. If the movie had shown a Jew converting to Christianity, it would've been branded as anti-Semitic and set off a firestorm.)The fact is more and more people are becoming nonbelievers. This is due to the availability of information on the internet that questions Christianity as well as other religions. The huge growth is not due to traumatic events. Some Christians (not all) feel that they're under siege because their beliefs are being questioned, and they're losing the dominance they once had. They don't like the idea that intolerance to non-Christians as well as LGBT individuals is now frowned upon.\"God's Not Dead\" is obviously a movie made by Christians for Christians.",

Also in the mix is a Muslim woman (Sittu) with a crisis of faith, an atheist blogger who has a crisis of non-faith, a preacher who just wants his car to start and a Chinese exchange student who is drawn to Josh's pronouncements. The professor and his wife (Oliver) seem to be in for conflict too but perhaps I'm front loading this boat a bit too much.Stylistically, this movie is not well developed. The stagecraft here is just bad with terrible blocking decisions, lazy camera work and a host of semi-professional actors left to talk at one another with little or no interesting action. Sorbo is easily the best actor in this entire mess but even he cannot escape moments of un-cinematic 180 conversations. The only time I noticed dynamic camera shots were in the opening credits and the last five minutes of the movie.Though the direction and cinematography is nothing compared to the writing which fits each character into a neat little Crash-like box mistaking stereotype for character. Nearly every non-white character is treated with a disrespect bordering on racist. Poor Chinaman and his over-valuing of family honor. If only he could be free to make his own decisions like an American can. Oh poor Muslim girl, if only she could escape her wrongheaded, borderline abusive father and be free to convert to Christianity like an American can. Oh and lest we forget the Rafiki-esque African reverend who seems to think watching a man die on the street is evidence of a \"good day\".Which brings me to the most egregious example of stereotyping in God's Not Dead, the angry atheist caricature. There are three people who are kindly enough to be the strawmen for this exercise in choir- preaching; the aforementioned blogger, the professor and a man I can only describe as the douchiest guy in the world. The blogger is brought to the good side when she is diagnosed with cancer. Before then she lived a life of selfish indulgences which included casual sex, environmental rebel-rousing and picking on red-blooded Americans like Willie Robertson and kin. Meanwhile the professor is revealed to be not an atheist but an anti-theist who denies God's existence because of something devastating in his past. Then there's the douche, who is just a douche. There's no explanation, he's given no motivation, he's just a big a--hole towards everyone he meets. So based on the very clearly drawn lines in the film, all atheists are jerks who if pressed, will acknowledge there is a God but refuses to believe because life is unfair.I could fit multiple column inches going over point by point, destroying every little wrongheaded detail of this shrill piece of propaganda but I won't. Honestly, ranting about how awful this movie is any further would be like beating an injured child. Christians, like all walks of life need to demand more of their art than just ham- fisted messages that reinforce a simple, whitewashed, easily- refutable worldview. Complexity is a good thing, especially when it comes to characters and their deeply held belief systems and I would welcome a movie that acknowledges that. For now though Christians will have to settle for a movie who only pushes its audience to ask one question: did I really pay money for this?",

But when he comes out with stuff like this I seriously need to reconsider my opinion of him.The main story is of a young Christian man who goes to college and his evil atheist professor forces him to defend his faith. It's kinda like that old e-mail that was making the rounds back in the 90's namely, \"It takes GUTS to stand up for Jesus\". Long story short evil atheist professor asks at the start of the semester whether anybody believes in God. He's done this every year and every year when somebody does he'd yell at them and \"prove\" God's non-existence by dropping a piece of chalk and saying that if God was real he could stop it from breaking. Well in all the times he did it, the chalk broke every time. Except this time when through a series of impossible events the chalk hits the ground without breaking. Humiliated he runs out of the class and the student in question then preaches for the next hour and brings the class to God and end scene.Throughout it all we're shown that anybody who's a Christian is a good and decent person. And anybody that isn't an atheist is cold and evil to the point of ridiculousness. Dean Cain, an atheist not only gets upset with his mother who has dementia because he knows she won't remember it in five minutes also dumps his atheist girlfriend when she gets cancer because \"she broke the deal\". Or the muslim father who beats his daughter for listening to Christian music and sermons on her iPod and then kicks her out of the house. Or Dean Cain's girlfriend with cancer is of course herself an atheist and she sets up to ambush interview one of the Duck Dynasty stars. She's also a vegetarian. I don't know if that adds or takes away from her character or not. And at the center of it all is Kevin Sorbo as the evil atheist professor.But Ksorbs isn't actually an atheist. He just hates God. Seriously, that's a plot point later on. His Mother died when he was younger and for that he hates God. And last time I checked atheism is when you don't believe in something. So how can you hate something that you don't believe in? You can't. This means that he's not, and never was, an atheist. In that, he's more of a strawman of what hardcore Christians think an atheist is.This guy is just over the top evil in this. First forcing the poor Christian student to defend his faith and then threatening him in private once he's made some apparently \"good points\" in class.Of course at the end, like all of these things including the e-mail, everybody stands up and applauds because they too are now Christian. And they all go to a Newsboys concert. Don't ask me why but I guess they're popular in Christian circles.Like a lot of Christian movies this takes the tried and true method of preaching to the already converted. It doesn't change hearts or minds and in my opinion this is what Christians should be focusing on assuming it's their intention in the first place.If you want to see one of these movies that actually feels like a real movie with real people, try the third one. Avoid this one like the plague.",

            "review_title": "Interesting Premise Wasted on Stereotypes, Melodrama and Religious Propaganda",
            "content": "I'll preface this review by saying when I saw some of the trailers, I found the premise of the film somewhat interesting: a student challenging a professor about the existence of God. However, the problem with this film is less about its core premise and more about its nearly insufferable rhetoric which overtakes much of the story. The first sign of trouble occurs at the very beginning. In \"God is not Dead\", at fictional Hadleigh University, Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) insists in an introductory philosophy class his students sign a statement which unequivocally states God is dead, meaning that God never existed. The idea is that he can't get on with his lectures unless the idea of God's existence or non-existence doesn't need to be debated. If a professor at a public university, and probably many private accredited universities, forced his or her students to sign a statement that God did not exist, that professor's tenure position would be in jeopardy. From the start, the premise has already been tainted with a rather ludicrous plot device. (And let's not forget that at private Evangelical universities, like Bob Jones and the like, students are taught unequivocally that not only does God exist but use religious texts in many non-religious courses.) The main plot of the film is that Josh Wheaton refuses the professors' insistence of signing the statement. So Wheaton must try to prove that science can't disprove the existence of God, which at first seems an interesting challenge. However, as we'll see, the rhetoric of Wheaton's arguments shift during the course of the film.The film actually has several story lines interacting at once. There's Wheaton versus Radisson, Wheaton and his girlfriend, Professor Radisson and his Christian girlfriend, a young woman dating a ferociously materialistic businessman, a local pastor and a Christian from an African country have bad luck getting a car to run to go to some kind of religious retreat, and a female college student who is Islamic and learning about Christianity in secret. And there's even a Chinese student in the class intrigued by the debates about God.As the story unfolds, many of the supporting characters become stereotypical and shallow as if they were lifted from the latest daytime soap opera. Each of them intentionally hurt the \"good characters\" who are all trying to either be good Christians or find God. Wheaton's girlfriend disowns him because he's decided to take the professor's challenge. The professor becomes more callous and confrontational towards Wheaton as the debate moves on. We learn at one point, the professor has personal reasons why he's an atheist. Then the father of the Islamic girl finds out about her interest in Christianity, and he reacts in a way you might expect of a film trying to propagate a particular religious point of view. And the woman dating the businessman finds out she has a major health problem, and he dumps her like spoiled food at a restaurant.However, the most disturbing moment was not the first debate offered by Wheaton but the second and third debates. In the first debate, which I thought was the strongest scene of the film, Wheaton offers a very good case why science can't disprove the existence of God. Science may not prove the existence of God but it can't disprove it either. Fair enough. But in the second debate, I noticed a shift in Wheaton's rhetoric. Now, the debate was about proving the existence of God, which seemed at odds with the premise of the film and the point of the debate. And in the last debate, Wheaton offers the evangelical position on evil. His debate is no longer about debating the existence of God, it's about answering religious questions from a Christian perspective. And then the professor and the student are debating about why religion is a good thing. And then how the pastor who can't get his car started resolves is so ridiculously silly and contrived, I couldn't believe it. Oh brother, give me a break. The final scenes become overly preachy. Almost insufferably unbearable.This film is not simply a story about a student debating about God in a philosophy class. The film is a sermon disguised as entertainment. I could buy some of the first act, although the abrupt break-up of the girlfriend seemed out of left field. However, by midway, I realized that this film is really Christian propaganda. In Acts 2 and 3, every scene was carefully written, scripted and acted in such a way to reinforce the Evangelical position of the filmmakers. This is a very lousy way to make a film. I was particularly disappointed in the portrayal of the Islamic father who goes crazy when he finds out his daughter is learning about Christianity. This is actually quite false as Islam has always embraced the learning about other religions, but the film propagates that traditional Islamists are against reading other religious texts. Telling me a story about Christians is one thing. Preaching to me about Christianity through a story is another, and that's not why I watch narrative films. Obviously this film was designed to convert people. Much better films with religious themes include \"The Blind Side\", which was a true story about real Christians, \"The Nun's Story\", starring Audrey Hepburn, based on the true story of a Belgian nun during the rise of Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II, and \"Fiddler on the Roof\", about Jews in Russia on eve of the Revolution. \"God is not Dead\" is not about real people or real situations, but just a forgettable contrivance that will only be applauded by those who already have a religious agenda. Huge disappointment.",

Based solely on the trailer it seemed as if atheists were being the only ones targeted in this film; atheists are portrayed as mean, selfish, and rude, while in contrast practically every Christian is shown as nice and intelligent. The atheist professor scenario is incredibly unrealistic and if anything would happen the other way around if it were to happen at all. It basically serves as an anti-liberal, anti-atheist message just for the sake of it.However in addition to atheists Muslims are also targeted in laughable form. They are depicted as violent and anti-women, abusing their daughter who wants to apparently convert to Christianity. The funniest thing is that these were Americanized Muslims who would never do anything like that in real life.It doesn't stop there, but I think you get the picture; the main reason for this one star review is simply the fact that this sends a horrible message. It depicts basically every non- Christian group as evil and mean, and also shows them as either angry or unintelligent; how else could you not believe!?In addition to the awful and unrealistic stereotypes portrayed the acting is mediocre at best, and the actual proof, the reasoning for God, is an overused and ridiculously outdated straw man that is presented as the holy grail of evidence, undermining all strong and intelligent debates that could come from the atheist side. I have nothing against Christians as individual people, however I do have a problem when they come together to make an awful film such as this. Do not see.",

            "review_title": "Propaganda and bad drama makes this movie trash",
            "content": "Based on the description of the movie given by IMDb and Netflix, you'd think this movie would be about a Christian student, Josh (Shane Harper), and his atheist philosophy professor, Dr. Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) debating the existence of God and raise points for both sides in order for the audience to make up their own minds about the debate. What the description leaves out is that the movie is pretty much a one-sided argument that reaches levels of hypocrisy and propaganda that I didn't see coming.Josh, a devout Christian who is just beginning his first semester at college, is put into Professor Radisson's philosophy class. Within the first five minutes of the class, Radisson asks all of his students to a sign a piece of paper declaring that God is dead in order to more easily get a passing grade. Everyone does so except for Josh, whom Radisson says must defend his stance in front of the class. Within this first scene with Josh and Radisson, we see the propaganda of the movie. Radisson, an atheist, is a snobby, know-it- all who won't respect anyone else's opinion on the subject while Josh is just passionately defending what he believes in.This is the same with all of the characters. Any character who is Christian is portrayed as a good human being while any atheist is portrayed poorly. There are two siblings, Mina (Cory Oliver) and Mark (Dean Cain) and they have an ailing mother (Lenore Banks). Mina, a Christian, goes to visit her often while Mark, an atheist, rarely visits her and even breaks up with his girlfriend (Trisha LaFache) for having cancer. It doesn't end there either. Josh's girlfriend (Cassidy Gifford) breaks up with Josh because he's defending his beliefs because it will affect his grade and as a result affect her future that she wanted to spend with him. If that wasn't bad enough, that leads to a level of hypocrisy that comes into play the last third of the movie. The ending of Josh's defense is that we are supposed to make up out own mind about whether or not God exists, after having it hammered into our heads with propaganda that anyone who doesn't believe in God is a mean- spirited, awful person.Even if you managed to ignore those aspects of the film, it still fails based on its other film elements. The characters are already very black and white in terms of whether they are good or bad and why they are (atheist or Christian), but it goes beyond that. As a drama, none of the characters are complex. They are just stereotypes. Josh is the Christian fighting for his beliefs to be heard. Radisson is the close-minded atheist. Mark is a selfish businessman. Reverend Jude (Benjamin A. Onyango) is the reverend who does nothing but talks about faith. In a movie like \"Jurassic World\", I can forgive the stereotyped characters because it's not supposed to be deep, but for a drama like this that's supposedly trying to raise some sort of point, it's not okay.At the end of the movie, Radisson is hit and fatally wounded by a car and is comforted as he dies by Reverends Dave (David A.R. White) and Jude who turn him to God in his final moments. While that's happening, a Christian rock concert is happening in town and everyone in the audience is asked to text out \"God's Not Dead\" to everyone in their contacts. Radisson gets a text from someone at the concert saying that and the reverends read it, with Jude proclaiming, \"What happened here tonight is a cause for celebration.\" Didn't a guy just get hit by a car and die? That is just one example of the awful writing this movie contains.While the movie does contain some unintentionally hilarious moments to it, it isn't funny enough of the time to save it as a so bad it's good movie. Had the movie not been so one-sided and hypocritical, the character and writing flaws would be almost forgivable in the grand scheme of things, but it doesn't do that. Instead, this movie takes the easy route to make its point by forcing propaganda down our throats.",

God's Not Dead tells a powerful story about faith. A college student, Josh Wheaton, takes a course in philosophy. His professor opens the class by telling everyone to write God is Dead on a piece of paper and sign it. Wheaton can't do it, because he is a Christian. The professor challenges him to defend his position in 20 minute segments at the end of the next three class days. Kevin Sorbo turns in the performance of his career. I imagine that this role had to be difficult for him, being that he is a Christian in real life, and had to play an atheist college professor has says such horrible things about God. Too many times, we as Christians don't speak out about our faith. We are afraid of being mocked and ridiculed. Hollywood doesn't put out many movies like this, because the actors and production staff are afraid of being blackballed for their beliefs. Also, newcomer Shane Harper turns in a great performance, throughout the film you want to root for him. Everyone is telling him just do what the professor says, but he can't. I also liked the little sub-plots, especially the two pastors want to go to Florida, but their car won't start (then the rental car won't start)and how they were masterfully woven together. It is definitely worth going to see. I do hope that some atheists and agnostics will see this film and reconsider their positions. I left this film feeling inspired, and I hope you will too.

            "content": "God's Not Dead is a movie with its heart in the right place and its head up its butt. It contains a microcosm of an idea, debating God's place in the natural order, but spends most of the time as a recruitment drive for the Christian faith in which you are recruited with your arm twisted behind your back. It's a messy film, badly made, badly acted and ends on a note so stupid that you feel like throwing fruit at the screen.Buried somewhere in this mess is a serious intellectual debate struggling to get out as a student is forced to defend his belief in God against an implacable philosophy teacher. You're led to believe that this will be the film's major focus. But actually, it occupies a minor corner of the movie as the movie sinks further and further into the realm of the ridiculous. How ridiculous? Well, ends at a Newboys concert at which Willie Robertson gives a video message calling for all Christians to text \"God's Not Dead\" to all of their contacts.As the movie opens we meet an earnest young college freshman named Josh (Shane Harper) who finds himself under the gun on the first day by his philosophy teacher, Mr. Radisson (Kevin Sorbo), a fire-breathing intellectual snob who informs his students that he means to do away with any silly debates about a Supreme Being by asking them to write \"God is Dead\" on a piece of paper and affixing their names. He's an atheist, and wears it angrily on his sleeve. Josh can't bring himself to sign on to such a thing. He's a Christian and won't give in to Mr. Radisson's demand. Radisson intends to humiliate the kid by handing him the lectern and asking him to defend his belief in God over the course of the next three classes.Periodically, throughout the film, the movie returns to this debate. The kid comes off like a pro, defending the point of creation, the meaning of philosophy and God's place in the grand scheme of things. He brings into question, philosophical ideas presented by Stephen Hawking, Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins and Aristotle. Meanwhile, the teacher dispenses the slings and arrows to try and trip him up.As long as the movie stays in this realm it finds a workable angle. When it steps outside that debate it falls flat on its face. The intellectual discussion has to fight for space against a series of unfocused supporting characters and half-written subplots that are introduced but never really dealt with. We get disapproving parents, faith-curious kids, dying parents, car accidents, break-ups, heartbreaks, cancer, dementia, dishonest rental car agents and stern Muslim parenting, all to the tune of a movie that looks and feels like it was made for TV.These elements wouldn't bother me if they mixed together into a convincing story, but they're all piled on top of one another like bits and pieces randomly glued onto the plot. There is, for instance, a hard-headed left wing blogger (Trisha LaFache) who confronts \"Duck Dynasty\" star Willie Robertson about his \"business of duck murder\" only hours before she is told she has terminal cancer. Then we meet her boyfriend (Dean Cain), a guy so mean that he gives her a tongue-lashing when she breaks the news about her illness.We also deal with a Muslim college student (Hadeel Sittu) who lives under the stern brow of her father who insists that she wear her burqa on campus. He might be shocked to discover that she's a closet Christian, listening to sermons by Franklin Graham behind closed doors. That story has a lot of potential, but is never resolved.Then there's some recurring nonsense about a minister (David A.R. White) who can't get his rental car to start until he appeals to the all-mighty for help. He's being stalled, you see, by divine intervention so he can help a non-converted soul who will cross his path. The movie cuts back to this man over and over and plays his problems as comic relief. Actually, it leaves you longing for a Fast Forward button.The only character in this movie that has any meat is the Mr. Radisson, played with spit and vinegar by Kevin Sorbo. He, at least, brings a challenge to the table and offers an opposing viewpoint. Radisson is proudly an atheist and, it goes without saying that his reasons have to do with a family tragedy, not philosophy. He has a final scene that comes right out of a romantic comedy, only instead of running after his true love, he's running after Jesus. At this, my forehead is still red from a nasty facepalm.What starts as an interesting idea about the meaning and origin of God's creation is ultimately saturated into movie that ends up cheerleading the Christian faith. I suppose there's nothing wrong with that except that it began with an idea of challenging atheism and then gives into preaching to the converted. The movie ends at the Newsboys concert with all of the major players coming to Jesus in a way that feels like a Pepsi commercial. When it was over, I wanted to pray for those responsible for such a cornball and half-baked movie. They could use it.",

If you're an Atheist, Agnostic or follower of a faith other than Christianity and have an emotional response - like many of the reviews posted - i'd just ask - why are you getting emotional? Investigate that more. And, ask God to reveal himself to you.At the end of the day, its a personal choice. I just hope the movie succeeded in sowing the seed of getting people to question their lifestyle and personal choices. God Bless you all abundantly in 2014. God Bless America.",

It's so poorly written with surprisingly offensive stereotypes, arguably racist and old, tired clich\u00e9s of how Christianity is attacked that it's almost unwatchable. In fact, as Christians or people searching I would recommend NOT watching it. Maybe it's impossible to have a well written script that is also Christian based. Goodness knows that so much of what Hollywood produces feels like an attack on faith so I should probably at least applaud the effort. But I can't. This film promotes much of the worst of Christianity. Franklin Graham??? Seriously???It could have been so much more. ANY element of realism, dialog and/or avoidance of tired caricatures would have vastly improved what the writer was trying to do. People are complicated. Faith is complicated. This movie is simply terrible. It's never a good sign when you are laughing at what is not a comedy. This is literally laughably bad.I pray some day a movie will be made that elevates Christianity instead of one that is so over the top, in your face and offensive like God's Not Dead that it makes it hard to be a follower of Christ. I shouldn't have to apologize for being a Christian and yet anyone who asks me about this movie the first thing I'll say is, \"As a Christian, I'm sorry . . .\"",

            "review_title": "An immature, dogmatic \"movie\" that couldn't back itself up (much less entertain you)",
            "content": "0.5/4I'm a movie buff who was originally interested in this movie to see a debate between God and science. Let me start by saying, I walked in knowing the sub-par standards of Christian movies. I also walked in knowing that it had the potential to be a very enjoyable movie. This was not the case. I hated every second of it. This was not a debate in fact, it was dogma. I have many issues with this movie, which are listed in depth below.1-Film Content )\nThe film is blatant propaganda. There is no way around it. That in itself is not a bad thing, but God's Not Dead takes such an overwhelmingly aggressive and negative tone. It becomes little more than an attack on all other world views. All atheists are portrayed as \"inferior\", and on top of that, the arguments the protagonist presents are brash and illogical. The makers of this movie have challenged everyone from physicists like Stephen Hawking to the great philosophers of old. Sitting through God's Not Dead would have been more enjoyable had the arguments been backed by actual logic, but at the same time, far less memorable.2-Character Developments/Portrayals )\nThe protagonist is my least favorite character in the entire movie. That's something I have only been able to say 4 or 5 times. He was arrogant in his arguments and he was childish in his demeanor. He thought he knew everything, and apparently so did the cast. He (and the avid atheist) based his argument on emotion rather than reason. After 85 or so minutes of waiting for a climax, he decides to shame the emotionally crippled atheist in front of an audience, ultimately forcing him to yield. It was an interesting sequence of events as far as a cinema standpoint (the atheist dies 5 minutes later because he was hit by a car), but as for the boy \"evangelizing\" both the on-screen and real life audience... not so much.\nIn addition, the atheist felt molded to represent the many people who aren't Christian: an angry, lifeless bad person. This doesn't much contradict the lead role who feels molded to represent the masses who are: an angry, lifeless good person. I feel like it does it's own religion a disservice, it paints a very bland, colorless picture of Christianity, probably a little less likable than atheism. All people are so much more than their worldview, and this movie does nothing to provide you a relatable character or the human condition. It's either a flawless zealot or a broken atheist. 3-Acting/Cinematography )\nWith everything else going on, I don't expect everyone to have picked up on this one. The camera was very choppy, especially in the classroom and at the concert. The acting really is fairly good, but the main characters too dominant, and the side roles are not allowed to facet their abilities and contribute to the story. (the lady with terminal cancer is a perfect example)4-The Way It Resonated )\nI would imagine that God's Not Dead has reached a few people, but only by giving them an ultimatum. The atheist who gets hit by the car has \"one last chance to make it to heaven\", the lady who has terminal cancer \"better hurt up and accept Him\". It almost made the impression that evangelism is all about scaring people with the possibility of hell. Of course, one can't complain, since the movie failed on the other front of trying to present a series of valid arguments.This movie should not be representative of Christian movies. It was a fairly entertaining on the rare occasion, but it's delivery was horrible and the problems in general were undeniably rampant. Christian movies should be characterized by movies which delve deeper into self-struggle, the thirst for spiritual knowledge, and have subtlety... three things evidently lacking in God's Not Dead.",

When a student refused and went public with the story, the teacher was dismissed (but sadly rehired months later). However that exercise was banned from further use.GOD's NOT DEAD is a film which strongly affirms Jesus's message: \"Whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.\" (Mat 10:33)",

A liberal, atheist, or person who chooses to not believe in God berate, belittle, bully, and vilify Christianity or make rude, demeaning comments about followers of Christ in the media and through film or written word. Additionally, they confuse the issue by trying to lump all Christians together with those who use the name of God or Christianity for their own selfish uses or fame, entirely against the very basis of Christianity.Should a Christian choose to take a stand against such bullying tactics as has been imploded upon Christianity or anything \"right wing\", are branded as \"stupid\", boring, propaganda generators(of all things)when all, for instance, this film is doing is presenting what often occurs in the secular film. Dare a Christian to state the same about secularism, then suddenly hate inducing words such as bigot, fanatic, crazy, demented, and other nasty descriptive words are flung.The events scripted in the movie are drawn from actual events in the secular university world, as well as public schools, and other public places. They weren't pulled out of the air to promote an agenda, other than to present that Christian right to believe in one God, Son of God, and the tenants of the Scripture are challenged constantly in our current humanistic arena of the United States. We're poked at, vilified, laughed at, humiliated, and demeaned simply for wanting to be allowed the same amount of tolerance afforded secularists, evolutionists, and atheists. That's all. Presenting a film based on actual court cases past and present. And thankfully, at the showing I went to, there was a packed theater of viewers not only watching but cheering for the spirit, professionalism, quality, and entertainment value of this film without having to resort to sordid sex scenes (again -- talk about boring, when it happens repeatedly in mainstream films), excessive profanity, and violence.This film tells the story of a college student who was threatened with failure if he did not buckle under the coercive, controlling, and bullying, unconstitutional tactics of a professor at a secular university in America. It's about a person's right to stand for what they believe in while (as a paying student) gaining a fair chance at an education and degree so he can be a productive citizen in America.",

While I honestly do not think this was a \"10\" movie, I had to put some kind of balance into the ratings. As a movie geek, I would give it a solid \"7\" on production, direction and acting. As a Christian, I did not come into this having thought that this was going to be a great movie just because it is a Christian movie. I let the movie speak for itself. And for me, it did speak. It definitely challenges you as a believer and even more so as an unbeliever. And that is what I am getting from these reviews. People not willing to even contemplate the existence of God, calling it \"propaganda\". But a movie that will spew evolutionists theories would not be considered this because it really doesn't challenge you to choose or think.Josh in the movie is asked to put in writing \"God is dead\" and tells the teacher that by his beliefs he cannot. Said teacher tries to belittle him by asking him to prove it. Having the courage to stand for your beliefs can be daunting, especially for a kid in college. The arguments he uses in the class are actually pretty good if you are willing to listen, but a lot of people will instantly say \"rubbish!\" without a second thought because that would mean the contemplation of God.In the last days. it is written, there will be a great turning away of God. So if you do watch this movie, watch it with a truly open mind. Not that of a person watching to bash it at each argument Josh presents.

In other words its a hate letter to atheists and Muslims. The film has several story lines that are connected. The main plot is about a college freshman named Josh Wheaton who enrolls in a philosophy class and is told to write by Professor Radisson that God does not exist on a sheet of paper. Granted this would not happen in real life because Professor Radisson would be fired. Radisson challenges Josh to a series of debates that just waste all the students time to prove that God exists. The worst point comes in the last debate when Josh says there is no reason to be moral if there is no God. So Josh is a sociopath? If Josh did not have his faith he would do horrible things? That right there makes Josh a very unlikable character. Other plots involve Professor Radissons girlfriend who he insults and makes her feel low at a party full of atheists. The atheists in this film are all portrayed as stereotypes who are all very unpleasant. Another has a forighen student arguing with his father on the existence of God. Another involves a young woman who is a liberal atheist who has cancer. She is later dumped on the spot by her lawyer boyfriend but finds faith but a band called The News Boys who are heavily advertised in the film. Another plot involves two pastors trying to get to an amusement park and another involves the lawyer and Radissons girlfriends mom who has dementia. Now the last plot involves a girl who is supposed to be a Muslim (who only wears a hijab and nothing else) and her strict father who abuses her and throws her out of the house when he finds out she is really a Christian. Its a crazy scene. Its trying to show Muslims as bad even though this kinda thing happens in all religions. The film goes on through a series of debates with Josh and Radisson. Its really just scenes of preachy straw men arguments that ends up with the students takes the side of Josh. It all ends up at a Newsboys concert in which a character gets run over and dies but since he repented before he died one of the pastors says its a good day right after he watched a guy die right in front of him! On top of everything else the film ends stating court cases were this film was based. They were mostly just unpopular pinions given by students and not persecution by religion. Gods Not Dead is a horrible film. The film is a mess. A very mean spirited mess of hate. Its the worst movie I have ever seen because of that.",

No particular goal or \"lesson learned\" other than proving that Christians are all good. The acting was terrible, character traits again stereotyping.This movie is nothing but pure Christian propaganda and the worst kind. If Jesus truly existed and he saw this, he wouldn't be pleased.

            "content": "Many films and art projects have some political or religious bias one way or another. There is a line of extreme bias, however, beyond which a project becomes a blatant piece of propaganda.Sadly, \"God's Not Dead\" doesn't so much cross this line as screech over it gleefully at 200 mph and start doing handbrake turns on the grass (probably over a flattened atheist college Professor).Shane Harper is student Josh Wheaton, enrolled in a Philosophy course taught by Professor Jeffery Radisson (Kevin Sorbo).Josh is a Christian student, Jeff is an atheist. Confrontation ensues.Now, in my real life experience of academia, University staff tend to be made up of people of very expansive cultural and religious backgrounds. They all usually have one thing in common too - a smart and sensitive tolerance of others' religious beliefs, whether they are atheists or not.Not so much in the one-dimensional pro-religion world of God's Not Dead, in which Prof. Radisson is an ignorant, selfish and ruthless ass who maniacally hates everything religious and doesn't seem to actually teach his students anything of note. Instead he just gets up on a pedestal and rants at his students about his own beliefs like a borderline lunatic.To be fair, Sorbo's acting is pretty reasonable. He's just portraying a character who is a completely simplistic evil strawman of atheists and thus he can't do anything to make the character a fair representation or likeable.Jeffrey makes blatantly terrible and facetious arguments in order to get smugly countered by our \"hero\" Josh over and over again and give those darn atheists a drubbin'. Of course it turns out he's just a scared coward who is afraid of believing in God, because apparently all atheists are just terrified little crybabies, not intelligent grown adults who simply don't believe in Christianity.Perhaps the worst part of the movie is the scene where Jeff is literally mown down by a car and killed in a brutal hit and run accident.Instead of this being depicted as the horrific incident that it is, instead we have a blubbering Jeff dying in the arms of an incredibly smug Christian (who is grinning, *GRINNING* at this!) as he renounces his atheism and defeatedly admits he was completely wrong about everything.This of course gives an excellent opportunity for the grinning zealot to dryly comment that Jeff will \"know more about God than any of us\" in a moment, having been coerced...err, sorry, \"convinced\" into joining the religion in his dying moments of terror.That is one amazing property of this film - despite the extreme Christian bias, it makes Christians look like cruel jerks. Josh is a smug know-it-all who slices Jeff to pieces effortlessly in every debate, even shouting at him on several occasions. Never does he doubt his philosophy or show humility, he's just right all the time...and boy does he know it.Similarly, a man's tragic death is instead treated like a great unbeliever being fatefully murdered by God's...compassionate (?!) wrath, and his God Squad getting another +1 before he shuffles off this mortal coil. Boom, another victory for Christendom!In short, the film is tasteless, pretty mindless and extremely biased. If I were a devout Christian I would actually be embarrassed by how it portrays the faithful.",

            "content": "When a film is made, the director's main goal is typical to score a successful receipt at the box office and possibly gain some valuable recognition at the Oscars. Then there are directors like Harold Cronk and Alex Kendrick who direct films with plots based on their religious beliefs with the primary purpose of dousing the audiences with their Christian- based message rather than scoring strong financial demands and achieving cinematic accolades. Though films in this category aren't well known for supplementing quality production value or solid acting, there are a few films that manage to evenly balance quality filmmaking and depiction of their religious themes. Many however, fail to reach this feat. This melodrama directed by Harold Cronk sits an example. The film follows Josh Wheaton (played by Shane Harper), an evangelist Christian teenager who embarks on his freshman year of college at the fictional Hadleigh University. There he enrolls in a philosophy class taught by Professor Jeffrey Raddison (played by Kevin Sorbo). During the first of class, Josh learns that Raddison is an atheist when he assigns the class with an assignment to write and sign a paper that says \"God is dead\". Josh however, refuses to do so as a means of protecting his faith. In response, Raddison challenges him in an assignment to prove the existence of God in manual lectures in front of the class for the next few weeks. If he fails to convince him, he will flunk out of the class. There is a fine line between film and propaganda that director Harold Cronk along with the writers struggle to distinguish here. This film seems to have nothing on its agenda other than shoving it's powerful religious message in your face. Although the film succeeds at cohesively expressing a touching message about protecting your faith, it crumbles at just about every other aspect. For the start, the plot is not clumsily written but suffers from heavy-handed execution that fails to be convincing. Instead of presenting an authentic story, the film goes for a manipulative (and cheesy) approach by exaggerating the circumstances of a young man fight to protect his faith. This approach involves villainizing every character who isn't a Christian, and does this in a rather over-the-top manner. By portraying Raddison with a cocky, mean-spirited attitude, particularly in the scenes focusing on him and his relationship his girlfriend who we learn is a Christian; the script appears to supplement an overly bias vibe. And the plot goes on, it continues to do this every other non-Christian character including Josh's girlfriend and a Muslim father who viciously beats his daughter when he catches her listening to a church podcast on her iPod. Even with the characters aren't not unrealistically written, the plot gets insanely sloppy and all over the place before long before the first hour. Throughout the time, the film constantly dips into these poorly executed subplots including a reverend and his partner struggling to deal with car troubles, a woman coping with cancer, and an Muslim teenager trying to hide her new found faith from her father. These subplots seems to do very little than serve as distractions from the main plot. In the end, it all becomes a mess.God's Not Dead may boast a strong performance by the lead Shane Harper and present an powerful message Christians can agree to, the film is nonetheless sorely unrealistic, even from a Christian standpoint. It feels more like 113-minute church sermon that is not too likely to leave an impact on non-believers, and it simply falls flat.",

The bottom line is this movie was made for a Christian audience which is only interested in patting each other on the back that they're \"the good guys\" in God's eyes. It's laughable, and downright depressing (as a Christian), that other Christians actually think this movie might be some form of evangelism for non-Christians.",

The debate for the existence of God and the implications of religion as an entity are hotly debated to this day. There's a reason this argument has been raging for centuries, and has had some of the greatest minds in history weighing in on it. I was really looking forward to an open discussion on the topic, with due service to both sides, in a nice, neat little film format. I was horribly disappointed. There's only one side shown, and surprise surprise, it's the Christian one. To call this film propaganda is an insult to propaganda films. The Christians are shown to be completely flawless human beings while the lone atheist is shown to be a vile, rude, condescending, venom-spewing tyrant, who gets \"owned\" before recanting his entire life's beliefs while dying in the street after being hit by a car (I really wish I was making that up). The film tees up every softball atheist argument it could possibly muster to lob at us, and then proceeds to pummel them into powder because they're ridiculous arguments. It's an insult to any rationally- thinking person on either side of this debate. Even if it weren't exactly as subtle as a sledgehammer to the teeth with its message, it's poorly-acted, the writing is hackneyed, and the side stories offer almost nothing in the way of payoff. It is a terrible movie in just about every sense of the word. It's unfortunate, too. Because a film about this subject has so much potential, but no one is getting anywhere with ham-fisted propaganda like this. Avoid this film at all costs. It is shockingly, offensively awful. Convince your atheist friends with any number of compelling works of intelligent theists instead.",

This might just be the worst movie I've ever seen next to \"Spy Kids 4-D\" and \"Master of Disguise.\"Watching this movie is like squirting lemon juice in your eye while periodically stabbing them with needles. Listening to this movie is like having a fly buzzing inside your ear while someone is simultaneously scratching their nails on a chalkboard. The movie is a Sloppy Joe that is overfilled with melodrama to the point of bursting. Every time you are meant to feel something, the movie queues the sappy music, or the inspirational music, or the happy music. In many ways, this is actually the Christian version of \"Crash\" without any of the good qualities Crash had.Actually, more comparisons to Crash can be made. The film follows a series of irrelevant characters that pop in and out of the movie and leave with no closure. Some of the stories actually feel very irrelevant until the ending...say, kind of like Crash! Moments between the intersecting characters are so melodramatic, so forced, and so poorly done that you'll be flailing your arms in an endless rage. The actors are all competent melodrama artists, giving exaggerated performances to the infinite degree. Mind you, they're not bad, but there's no subtlety in the acting, you don't feel the kinks and cracks of the characters, all emotions are full frontal. Also, why are the guys from Duck Dynasty here? Or one of the guys, rather. The only purpose he serves is so the viewer can go \"Oh, I saw that guy on Duck Dynasty, and he believes in God! Therefore God must exist!\" This film is disgusting. And I'm not saying that because I'm an atheist. As a Christian, I'd be furious too. Spoiler alert for those who actually care. The professor in the film gets hit by a car and dies. However, before he dies, he is given faith in the lord by a passing minister, priest, pastor? (I have no idea, I didn't pay that much attention, do you blame me?) Is this film saying that you need to die or have a near death experience to find God? Absolutely absurd! Also, the professor makes the claim that people who have traumatic experiences turn to God for help, yet he had a traumatic experience and that made him in atheist! It's completely contradictory and the movie's \"argument\" (It's not an argument, there is no argument presented, it's irrefutable. The movie wants you to believe God is a cold, hard, fact. collapses in on itself. In addition to pulling all of the tricks, the movie also has the nerve to insult great scientists like Charles Darwin and Stephen Hawking by saying they don't have a right to their beliefs, and by trying to argue their statements against them.Now you're probably wondering why this \"movie\" isn't getting a 1 from me. And it definitely deserves it. However, as a critic, I believe there is always some good to every movie, no matter how bad it is, and no matter how terrible its agenda is. I know I said I wasn't going for a fair review here, but there is a quality of the movie I actually, personally liked. And well, the direction is actually pretty good. There's some nice shots in there and it captures the locations well. But other than that, there's nothing. Not a single thing.Also, the movie ruined Macbeth-my favorite Shakespearean play-by having the professor quote it, so thanks for that.",

Had they stuck simply to this with the script, I would most likely be writing a much different view. However, just like all other religious propaganda pieces, they proceeded to spend maybe 10 minutes total on that issue while instead focusing on some ridiculous plot line that hardly correlates with the point the film was trying to make.To top it all off, the script and acting was so awkward I spent the entire movie cringing, and that wasn't on purpose. The dynamics between the characters was so completely wrong, out of context and out of character that for a while I was under the impression I was watching a movie based off a script that my 10 year old sister wrote.In conclusion, don't waste your time. I don't care what religion you call home, this is probably not for you. Fanatical far-right wing bible thumpers: this in no way challenges your beliefs or causes you to think outside the box and consider an opinion other than your own so this is probably the perfect movie you and your brain-washed children to watch to reassure yourself you've chosen the right path and that hating people of all other beliefs and cultures is the right thing.For the rest of us logical and sane individuals, there are a million other movies that are a better use of your attention.",

It started really well, was scripted properly and the content came across as well researched and it was not just another \"he said she said\" melodrama. But this unfortunately did not last long. Although the first half of the film really made me think that this story had something to say and it was well presented, produced and constructed, it ended up concluding into just another religious propaganda and a sad let down. Though the main character sets up a flawless arguments for God not being dead and the film takes off on an intellectual high, by his final argument, he fades into an emotional dead pool of opinionated statements not based on any solid platform and the film disappoints gravely on its promise of offering any philosophical insight. The atheist professor starts off as strong and somewhere the scripts just leaved him behind and he becomes a weak caricature open for attack and to be used as a propaganda tool \u2013 and not even a good one! It's a simple set up and anyone can see it. Sadly also the movie gets high jacked by an assumption that Christianity is the only true religion and has some sort of trademark on the idea that God really exists. Without being in your face it does this in many subtle ways \u2013 especially looking at the story of the Islam girl converting to Catholicism \u2013 it wants to suggest that they \"own God\". And what is all that soppy business with the car that does not want to start \u2013 till you pray about it! REALLY! Just plainly a c-story-line rip off of the amazing film - \"Conversations with God.\" As someone who have interest in all forms of theism, I found these moves by the film irritating, bias and prejudiced. It is insulting that it sets up a premise to haul you in as an educated and intellectual viewer and then slaps you in the face with a bunch of evangelism and a conclusion that is unmotivated and weak. I am not saying there is no place for evangelistic films \u2013 I believe to each person their own entertainment \u2013 but beware that when you enter this film, it is not what it pretends to be... That said, Josh's line \"How can you hate someone that does not exist?\" offered at least a glimmer and a clue towards what I think this movie was ACTUALLY supposed to be about - was it not whitewashed with all the desperate clutter of meaningless preaching.",

It sounded simple, but it was more complicated than I thought. Not only because there were other stories getting mixed into this one story, but because the professor himself had a painful very much understandable moment where he confessed why he hated God.I couldn't stop crying at scenes like the boy losing his girlfriend over this project of proving that God's not dead, the newfound Christian girl being cast out of her own home and how painful it was for her and her father, the professor's pain at seeing his mother die after praying for her to not die, and the Newsboys praying for a woman dying of cancer. I ultimately cried at the last one after fighting tears in the other scenes. The film was hard and powerful, though the only picky things I have is why there are lots of stories mixed into the one main story, does the atheist always have to be the jerk, do professors really make students sign a \"god is dead\" paper for a grade, and why does about 85% of the character have to have conversions? My parents even thought it would be more powerful if the professor didn't cave in at the end and that not every Christian movie should do a conversion (unless this one really happened). Maybe I'm just nit picking, let me know if I'm not.This movie is perfect for a revival. Go see it; God's Not Dead!",

            "content": "God's Not Dead is a bunch of nondenominational christians Patting themselves on the back, that is cleverly disguised as a film. At the center of the \"plot\" of Gods Not Dead is the story of a Christian college freshman, Josh Wheaton, (played by Shane Harper, and yes the character's name is actually Josh Wheaton.) who enters an introductory philosophy course only to find out that the class is run by an evil cruel atheist, who was obviously written by christians that have never met a single atheist in real life. And on the first day of class Professor Radisson (played by Kevin Sorbo.) forces all of the students to write \"god's dead\" on a piece of paper. But our hero refuses to confirm with the completely irrational demands of Radisson, I mean seriously philosophy is supposed to be about discussion, no philosophy professor would remove discussion from his classroom, but back to the plot. Professor Radisson then says that if Josh refuses to sign the paper he will then have debate with Radisson and prove god's existence in front of the whole class. Josh excepts this challenge. But this just wonderfully crafted story (I'm joking when I say that) is only the main plot, their are countless side plots/characters that the debate feels really not important.God's Not Dead is pure Christian propaganda. But a film should not be dismissed just because it is propaganda, some of the greatest films of all-time like Battleship Potemkin, Birth of a Nation, and Triumph of the Will were blatant propaganda. But unfortunately God's Not Dead is the worst kind of propaganda film. And the funny thing is the film was marketed as this great film that was gonna convert so many horrid no-believers to Christianity, when in reality it was just something that was made that christians are supposed to watch and feel good about, because all the film does is reinforce their beliefs, while doing nothing to actually convert people, and the ending basically flat out says that Christians were supposed to be the ones watching the film.The arguments on both sides of the debate are so laughably bad that it's not even worth getting into. Well actually let me just say this about the arguments, for and against god in this film. The Christian arguments are exactly what you'd expect, flimsy weak arguments that mainly rely on sophistry or appealing to emotion. And the atheist arguments are just terrible, because they're written to be terrible, because Raddison is the villain and he has to be proved wrong. The film never even entertains the idea that he could be right, actually the film never even entertains the idea that it's a debate at all, which makes for a very one- sided and mind numbingly boring movie.Let's be nice and just say God's Not Dead lacks subtlety. Every single atheist, or even people that are just liberals, in the film is an arrogant irredeemable asshole. And every Christian in the film is an absolute saint, that is just trying to resist the evil godless system. All of the acting and writing in the film is really really bad. And I mean like 80s daytime TV sitcom bad. All of the characters come off as obviously made-up characters in a movie. The writing is even worse, every single thing/every single character says/does in this film is either really stupid, really cheesy, or is just said/done to move the plot along even though it makes no sense. Not to mention a lot of the side stories end up being really unimportant and not adding to the film at all. Like for example the side-plot about the preacher who can't start his car. Why was that in the movie? Why did we need to know that? The only reason I can come up with is to set up for the end, but the thing they didn't need to set it up. (you know what I mean if you've seen the movie) I would say that these were just added to artificially extend the running time, but the film is nearly two hours so they could a cut out a lot of stuff and it would have still had a decent running time. So I really can't explain why the car scenes, and several others, were in the film.Even though God's Not Dead was universally panned by critics, it still grossed enough money to warrant a sequel, and several other Christian films from the company that made it. I don't hate God's Not Dead as much as some other films out there, but I can't really think of a film that not only fails at every single aspect of filmmaking but also spreads false information. There is not one thing that is even sort of passable in this movie. Everything is just terrible. And for the most part it isn't even funny bad. I can't really recommend this film to anyone.1.8/10",

I'm not a Christian, and I thought the movie was good. Obviously the script/acting/whatever wasn't anything special, but it was watchable for sure, and I actually enjoyed the positive energy displayed in the film, and the positive message.I've met a lot of Christians in real life, and I have to admit, they're some of the nicest people around. You don't see the bitterness and hidden anger like you do with a lot of people, you actually notice the genuine kindness in them. If Christianity is bringing people like that into our world, then why bash them? If Christian films are bringing movies with good messages in them, then why put them down? If people that believe in God are some of the most humble and hard working people on Earth, then why put them down? Why put down a movie that is showing their love? I see the argument in some of these reviews that religious people like to try and \"force\" their beliefs onto others. I don't think this is true, I don't think they force anything, they just want to be heard, to share their voice. Why not listen and keep an open mind? What really makes me sad is people that have already made up their mind without even bothering to listen. Just listen, let them talk, and if you disagree then kindly move on with your life. There's no reason to hate people that are just trying to share their beliefs because they genuinely believe that it'd help you out.Imo this movie has a very nice message in it that a lot of people have missed. Sure there are Christians who are bad, that use religion just for money, but there are people like that all over the world and in every religion. Sure the Muslim dad beat his daughter, but there are people like that in Christianity also. We can completely flip the movie around and make the Muslim dad Christian, and the Christians all Muslim. But the message would still be the same. Don't listen to others, but follow your own heart. Listen and then do what makes you happy. You don't know everything, nor do I, nor does anyone, that's why we have to watch movies like these, just so that we can learn something, even if it's something small. Great movie, don't listen to the bad reviews. This is coming from a person who's neither atheist, agnostic, Christian, or any other religion. I don't know what I believe in and I never will, but anything that has a positive energy to it and genuine kindness in it I will listen and watch with my full heart. Maybe some day my heart will speak to me and I'll know what to do, and what I believe in but that's not anytime soon.",

            "review_title": "\"God's Not Dead\"- Objectively passable on a technical filmmaking level. But the condescending propaganda and straw-man arguments the script relishes in make it unwatchable.",
            "content": "\"God's Not Dead\" was a surprise hit in 2014, and one of the few overt Christian-themed dramas to really find a rather large mainstream audience, bringing in more than $60 million at the box-office on an extremely meager $2 million budget. However, as with many films that deal with blatant and obvious religious themes, it drew quite a bit of controversy, and it's really hard to be objective on a fundamental level towards a work like this. Your own personal views are almost guaranteed to dictate your enjoyment towards a film of this nature. But as someone who is agnostic-bordering-on-atheist but very open to the idea of faith (just as I am open to the notion that God might very well not exist), I'm a pretty impartial audience member. I've enjoyed films with religious themes in the past, and even if I completely disagree with a viewpoint presented, I can can enjoy a good and well-written movie no matter what. Even if just for achievements in the technicalities of filmmaking or good writing.Unfortunately, director Harold Cronk's \"God's Not Dead\" is not a good or well-written film. In fact, I'd go so far as to regard it as near-unwatchable. And it really falls back on one massive, unforgivable issue- this isn't really a movie. It's a blatant piece of self-aggrandizing propaganda that was manufactured exclusively to profit from the religious by force-feeding them only what they want to hear without challenging them in any way or doing anything to strengthen their faith. It doesn't reward its Christian viewers- it babies them in a genuinely troubling and patronizing way. It's like dangling keys in front of an infants face. It treats the Christian characters like saints. It demonizes atheist characters by turning them into nothing but either blood-thirsty, mustache- twirling villains or weak-willed lost-souls who need to \"see the light.\" It inserts blatant pieces of product- placement and tactless bits of advertising to appeal to the youth. It's just generally a disgusting experience.It's honestly about as condescending as you can get. I honestly can't help but feel sorry for the people who were suckered into seeing it thinking it would be a positive experience in faith. When in actuality all it is, is lowest-common-denominator trash that pushed just the right buttons to come out, take their money and leave them with nothing gained from having seen it. Thankfully, I think enough people have learned this, especially as the 2016 follow-up earned significantly less at the box office.We follow college student Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper)... yes, his name really is \"Josh Wheaton\"... who enrolls in a philosophy course headed by Professor Jeffrey Radisson (Kevin Sorbo), who insists that each and every student sign a piece of paper stating \"God is dead\" in order to pass his class. Of course, Josh refuses, and thus begins a sort-of rivalry between the two, eventually leading to a series of very arrogant debates about whether or not \"God is dead.\" Along the way, a series of loosely connected subplots involving broad stereotypes plays out, most of which paint anyone atheist or liberal as evil or petty. And they even throw in references and cameos from the show \"Duck Dynasty\" for \"good\" measure! ...Yawn.Honestly, the film's not a complete and total failure. I actually found Sorbo fairly compelling even if his character is flat and follows an easily predictable story-arc. He does good with the material provided. Some scenes are reasonably well-shot and there's a few cute moments here and there. But honestly, the complete ignorance and constant straw-man nature of the script by Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon is just cringe-worthy and incredibly snobbish. This film really was an opportunity to say some fascinating things and to both challenge and reward the faithful viewers it was certain to have. It could have found a way to deliver a compelling tale about reconciliation and finding peace between people with different viewpoints. In another universe, the film could have been an uplifting tale about the two leads coming to terms with their differences and perhaps even becoming friends despite having vastly different beliefs, and celebrated faith by giving the viewers hope... but nope! Without spoiling anything, from the opening scene, the film makes it clear that it has nothing but contempt and disdain for anyone who dares hold an opposing viewpoint, and goes out of its way to manufacture conflict. It's actually really disheartening and even dangerous.There's really no other way to say it... this is a 1 out of 10. It's condescending. It's snobby. It thumbs its nose at those who disagree with Christianity. And it's nothing but a clear attempt to profit off of the faith of the viewers. It's just a disgusting film all around. There are other, far better Christian films out there that can be enjoyed by the faithful and sometimes even the not-so-faithful (like me, I suppose) alike. See one of those instead.",

            "content": "First off let's start with all the negative comments this film has received. Offensive, one sided, preachy, etc, etc. OK, for all who feel this way let me point you to pretty much any other theater or television show which demeans, belittles, humiliates, ridicules, etc, any person of faith, particularly any type of Christian, and maybe you can understand why movies like God's Not Dead take on the task of entertaining while proselytizing. Is the film predictable, yes it is. Wow, you couldn't see that coming from a film which is pro-Christian, please go buy tickets for the Muppets instead. Hint, hint, the good guy wins in the end. Sorry to also tell you, in the Spaghetti Westerns Clint Eastwood always wins as well.Is the acting Oscar worthy? No really, these are mostly unknown or little known actors and actresses. However, Dean Cain does quite well but he is shown up by the performance of Kevin Sorbo who does an excellent job of portraying pretty much every liberal arts professor it has been my \"pleasure\" of knowing.Is there a Christian bias? Again if you can't see this coming, maybe this is not the film for you. It is commonly said this picture depicts all Christians as righteous and moral people who are railroaded by non- Christians. False, in the film the main character is in fact a good kid who takes on the task of defending his faith yet he is opposed by those closest to him. Spoiler alert!!!...his gf is a real B who cares little for her faith and wants everything to work out HER way while still professing to be Christian. Hmmm, sounds like some Christians we all know. Accurate. At the same time the main character's family attempts to have him deny his faith in order to pursue his professional goals. One can only conclude these people are also Christian and believe money and success supersede faith.Are non-Christians characterized poorly in this film. Yes......and no. The Islamic father seems to be characterized poorly until you consider a few things. First, his reaction to his daughter's conversion is very realistic. Secondly, he loves his daughter more than anything except for Allah(God). Finally, his reaction to her conversion and the conflict which arises because of this shows true human emotion of pain, conflict, betrayal, and love. The film would have been served better to dive further into this relationship but unfortunately it did not. -1 point.The Chinese exchange student who is not Christian is portrayed in a very positive light as is the rest of the Philosophy class who are depicted as atheists or at least agnostic. These are people who originally believe the main character, Josh, is insane and needs to get a life. However, despite their lack of faith and fear of the professor they have open minds and listen to both the high and mighty professor as well as the proverbial lamb to slaughter in the form of Josh.Last question...Is this film preachy? Well DUH! It is a Christian made film which attempt to fight back against the constant anti-Christian messages preached in Hollywood (yes misspelling is on purpose)and in classrooms across the nation. It is kinda the theme here people in the same way things like South Park, Dogma, and even the Big Bang Theory have an anti-Christian message. However, the movie is also thought provoking not only for non-Christians but for Christians in particular. For instance, in the movie Josh accepts evolution. WO!!! Christians and evolution, there's a crazy car ride home for Christians of differing denominations. Also the subplot of Josh's relationships with his family and his gf for anyone to ponder priorities and expectations. Perhaps the greatest though provocation Christians can have after viewing this film is...do you really have faith if you are never forced to truly question what you believe?Overall, I was expecting a corny, low budget Christian flick with a clear message. I was not disappointed except that this movie came much closer to the quality of a main stream film than I had expected, which surprised and delighted me. The writing was good except for a few Brady Bunchesque corny lines which again, I have to warn you are expected in this type of film.",

In this particular case, an atheist (cue boos and hisses from this movie's target audience) philosophy professor requires students to acknowledge that there is no God in order to pass his class. I've personally taken multiple philosophy classes at an \"evil\" secular university. Not once were any students' grades impacted by not renouncing their beliefs. This is clearly a college movie written by people who have never even set foot on a college campus, much less in a college classroom.

This film keeps the audience entertained by providing many other side plots. One example is a story about a young atheist, who is diagnosed with cancer and follows her journey to come to terms with her fate and find Christianity. My favorite part of the movie is its theme of showing that one shouldn't force anything on anyone, which is why Josh chose to stand up for himself. I felt like Josh supports this theme, but he never proved that God was real. The biggest problem that I had with the movie is that it seems to make Christianity sound like the best religion by having all of the atheists and people of other religions in the movie seems like total jerks or have something bad happen to them. Professor Radisson, an atheist, seems like a jerk because they constantly have him threatening to ruin Josh's career, and ends up getting hit by a car. They also make the father of a Muslim girl a terrible person because he hits and kicks out his daughter for wanting to be Christian. At the end of the movie, they also showed a message telling the audience to send 'God's not dead' to all of the contacts in their phone. I understand that this movie is meant for Christian audiences but it was still overly biased. Overall, I enjoyed the plot of the movie and its theme. However, I felt as if it was trying to force Christianity on me. I would recommend this movie to any Christians, who firmly believe in their faith, but for people of other religions, I would stay away from it.",

This film, however, is purely propaganda.I read a review on here from a pastor. The pastor called the film, \"more propaganda than art, and thoughtful atheists will see it for what it is even if Christians can't\".

The acting was adequate but the plot so simplistic and lacking in drama that I just got bored. The characters had neither depth nor reason for their actions other than Josh - and his were never fleshed out properly. There was no action or comedy to leaven the deadly weight. I stopped watching after a half hour. Frankly, I enjoyed Plan 9 better because at least I could laugh at it's poor quality.

But faith in what? I notice there's no general agreement in the world. These matters of faith, they are not compelling. I have my faith, you have your faith, and there's no way in which I can translate my faith to you or vice versa.At least, as far as reason is concerned, there's a system of transfer, a system of rational argument following the laws of logic that a great many people agree on, so that in reason, there are what we call compelling arguments. If I locate certain kinds of evidence, even people who disagreed with me to begin with, find themselves compelled by the evidence to agree. But whenever we go beyond reason into faith, there's no such thing as compelling evidence. Even if you have a revelation, how can you transfer that revelation to others?

One is a freshman Christian student Shaner Harper), one is a university cafeteria employee--a girl who grew up in a Muslim home (Hadeel Sittu), one is a Chinese exchange student (Paul Kwo).We also have the atheist professor (Kevin Sorbo) and his friends in academe...and his girlfriend (Cory Oliver). The girlfriend tries to convince her rich and successful brother (Dean Cain) to help care for their ailing mother. The brother is about as callous as he can be--not really showing much care for his family or his girlfriend.We also meet up with a local minister (David A.R.

Trisha LaFache, who plays Amy--the girlfriend of the successful but materialistic stock broker has one of the best moments of emotional fear/frustration/anger/heartbreak I think I've seen in any film.What one has by the end of the film is assurance--there are reasons to believe in God, and theism is not a fairy tale.

I should say I have worked in highly technical scientific industries, read quantum physics, understand Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism, and have gone to great lengths to understand the God argument (in graduate school.) Before getting to the movie, let me say I detect a pervasive flaw in the largely male opponents \"bad\" reviews. They actually take an anti-Christian position, when the movie is about God, not Christianity, per se. Atheists, in the US are not really atheists, they are anti-Christian. Actually, in the early post apostolic Christian church, they were persecuted for being atheists, because they were monotheistic, not polytheistic like the pagan society at the time who believed more in reason. Today, over 92% of people worldwide believe in God. In fact, Jews, Christians and Muslims all believe in the God of the Old Testament, the God of Abraham. In the middle east recently, I noted that their murder rates were about what they are in the U.S., except that over 1/2 theirs were honor killings, by male fathers of female children, who were oppositional. That a Muslim father in the US would banish his child rather than kill her over switching to a Christian God is benign treatment by middle east standards. Anyway, the movie's collegiate scene presentation is fairly accurate, coming from the friend of a humanities professor. Probably 80% of philosophy and religion professors are \"liberals\" like the one in the movie. I also serve as a college trustee, so I have first hand knowledge to support that view. Also, from a scientific standpoint, quantum physics is tending toward confirmation of a God, these days, not as theory, but through experimentation. Quantum leaps and non local connections and a variety of other data contradict the God is dead position. Lastly, the rebuttal presented by the student, soundly refuted the professors arguments, again and again. This is not my opinion, but that of countless scholars who have painstakingly counter argued the movie professors list of God is dead Theorists. I deducted points from my ranking because the low budget film plot was a bit wooden. The student's presentations were well documented, and argued, but his graphics were unbelievable. The prof's deathbed acceptance for me reinforced the position that most atheists, are really spurned former Christians - anti-Christians really. Still, it seemed a bit contrived. Lastly, Christians today are a minority, and believing in One God stand apart from society as a whole, self-separated as they have for a couple of thousand years. They have always been persecuted and will continue to be. But in the US, we are still a country where freedom of religion is respected, in spite of a majority of pseudo scientific \"atheist\" anti Christians liberals who disagree. The movie made its point.

It is a movie that further separates Conservative Christians (the more hardcore Conservative Christians, but not all Conservative Christians) from the rest of the world, but not because the whole world is against them, as this film would have you believe. No, it's because they fight a war that doesn't exist.They pretend that Hollywood is all anti-Christian and downright evil, but if you take even the smallest glimpse with an open eye, you can tell that that is just not true. Almost everyone celebrity in Hollywood is either religious or has religious backgrounds, like Michael Keaton, Jim Caviezel, John Ratzenberger, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom, Jr., amongst others whose names escape me right now. Hollywood is not anti-Christian (though it is still pretty messed up in plenty of ways), and the world is not all against Conservative Christians. It just looks like that more and more because Conservative Christians (though, once again, not all of them, because that's it how life works; Just the more hardcore people) keep putting themselves against everyone else.But this movie also puts atheists in such a mean-spirited and cruel light that makes no sense. Kevin Sorbo plays an exaggerated atheist who is just plain evil. And really, so does everyone else in this movie. If you were a young Christian and this movie and others like it were the only things you could watch (which does happen for some people, and is happening increasingly among people I know), then you would come to believe that all atheists are just terrible people that deserve whatever is coming to them, and that's not true. Like all groups of people, atheists have good and bad. They are just regular people whose think differently about life, and we should treat them fairly and kindly, like we should all people. And, once again, this is coming from a Christian.Now, aside from all of that, the movie is just poorly made, with uninspired, flat, and boring camera work and lighting, terrible acting, lazy and unfocused writing that doesn't even really attempt to tie in the 3 different stories it tries to tell (unless you count them all going to the same concert as tying it all together), and direction that lacks any hint of subtlety.

They don't believe He exists, and neither do I, so Christians will waste sympathy if they think atheists are all just angry like Radisson. But quit trying to fit this movie into your preconceived notions.Representing the struggles of Christian students who've had to sue their universities for playing Thought Police, one insightful element in this movie is that the professor who bullies the student does so for emotional, rather than logical, reasons. His aim is not actually to convince his students of anything. In the beginning, professor Radisson explains that he prefers to skip the chapter on religion and directly tells the Christian student (Josh) \"you're free to pray to whoever you want in your dorm room, but what you do in my class becomes my business\". Radisson wants to skip the chapter on religion after his Christian mother died of cancer, because the letter she left him said she hoped he'd remain faithful, and he hasn't. Religion makes him uncomfortable because he is angry enough at God to publicly claim he is an atheist, but he still prefers the company of Christians.Even his wife is a Christian, and she complains that he won't discuss religion with her. Although he likes to create doubt, he's not trying to convince anyone to become an atheist, because he personally still believes in God. This is why he has his students skip the chapter regarding atheist arguments if they will simply write \"God Is Dead\" on a piece of paper, sign their names and hand those in. If they will do this, they need not read Dawkins, Russell, etc. and they will get full credit for that chapter in class. He's basically bribing the Christians to insult a God he still believes in, but feels bitter towards. This also makes the reading material assigned seem like extra homework, if any student resists.We discover Radisson was not always so hard on Christian students as he is in this movie. He married one of his former students, who is still a Christian. One reason that Raddison has recently taken up scoffing at the freshmen who make him slog through the religion chapter is he is tired of teaching freshmen. He wants a promotion. He hopes that the other faculty will grant him one after they hear he is bullying his Christian students, believing he is too impatient to handle freshmen. He shows off about this, also hoping they will admire his wit. Although he is typically affectionate towards his Christian wife, when he tells his colleagues about his debate with his Christian student, his wife points out the age gap between him and the student he is debating, explaining how the odds are in his favor since they are debating in his area of expertise. As if this isn't embarrassing enough, she also admits to the entire philosophy department that she, Radisson's wife, is still a Christian. His hopes of promotion dashed, he begins belittling her, insulting her intellect and treating her like hired help. This confuses her because she doesn't understand his desire to impress his colleagues. As his friends chuckle nervously at their displayed marital difficulties, she just sees them as snobs and worries much less about their judgments, so she decides to leave her husband. Even then, she again approaches Radisson in front of his colleagues and students to tell him she is leaving him, embarrassing Radisson further, and further enraging him at Josh.Josh is also falling behind in his other classes, trying to find good arguments for Raddison's class, so his own girlfriend also leaves him. In the end, Radisson is hit by a car and, the only reason a pastor is able to help him say the \"sinner's prayer\" (which one would assume any kid who had been a Christian at age 12 would have already said), is because God prevented the pastor's car from starting the previous days. Naturally, the pastor did not understand why his car wouldn't start, since he was unable to predict God's plan, so the pastor had been angry with God about this.So there it is: an actually fairly complex movie (at least on an emotional level) about how a bitter Christian decided to become right with God on his deathbed, after ruining the semesters of a few Christian students who were unfortunate enough to pass through his class while he was still angry with God. It's not exactly a happy ending, but then the movie is followed up by the real life lawsuits to remind us why.Atheist reviewers, many with probably worse characters than those portrayed in the movie, complain that there isn't one decent atheist in this movie but, in fairness, there are actually only two atheists in the entire movie, and one isn't so bad. She does love animals, anyway, and confronts a Christian who likes to torment them. One thing many atheists tend to forget is that they are not at all this movie's target audience, and how many movies portray Christians in a poor light? Sorry if you took it personally, but especially reviewers who write for major publications should grow up, be objective and review the movie fairly. Frankly, this Christian movie beats out all the religious snoozers that came out when I was a child.",

The hero is a pitiful wimp with few redeeming qualities. He provides nothing in the way of a reasonable arguments for the existence of God, even though any student of philosophy would know that there are many. Rather than teach, the professor simply insults and demeans his students. I have never known a university professor that would treat students like that. The hero's girlfriend of six years simply dumps him, citing that she told him not to argue, as if she was somehow his boss and could order him about. The Muslim girl's father is harsh and critical, again very stereotypical. There was a couple, who I really don't know how they fit in, but they seemed to be a couple, possibly living together. She learns that she has cancer in what is supposed to be a stirring moment, but she seems to brush it off like, \"I'll just take a couple of aspirin and be fine.\" But, then she meets her boyfriend at a posh restaurant and he is portrayed as a callous, unfeeling, selfish jerk. It was at that point that I just pressed the eject button, put the disc back in its sleeve and hauled it down to the mailbox for its return ride to Netflix. A thoroughly rotten movie.If you have seen this movie, I am sorry; you are never getting that 90 minutes back. If you haven't, don't waste your time.",

            "content": "Summary: God's Not Dead is filled with dull performances, stupid characters and random situations. 30/100 (D+)I can't believe how successful this film was at the box office. Of course I know that a lot of movie goers are interested in this kind of religion matters, but c'mon $62 millions worldwide, that's a lot of money for a movie that cost only $2 millions. Anyway, it has a huge premise and it has Shane Harper in it, so I decided to see it. A few performances were likable but the whole film is a strange mess. It has lots of uninteresting subplots and most of the performances were dull, although I have to admit that at least the young actress Trisha LaFache and Disney's star Shane Harper were good during the film; that's why I give it a 1.5/5 rating, they both made this movie a little bit better; the rest of the cast is just plain awful.The script is somewhat uneven because the movie kept me entertained at times, especially in all those power-point presentations that Shane's character had to explain; but there are several moments in the film where the dialog is just unbelievable, stupid and mindblowingly awful; for example, there is a scene where a girl tells to his boyfriend that she has cancer, and he answers: \"Who cares?\" or something like that I don't remember. I was like... are you serious? Who wrote this atrocious pile of crap? The whole movie is filled with moments like this one. Yes, it was interesting at times and it makes you think about your beliefs and the existentialism, but it is a shame that the film ended up as cheap propaganda.The director Harold Cronk has no idea of how to treat these delicate themes and issues in his movie, such as: religion, abuse, etc. It is an empty, heartless and surreal flick. Although I enjoyed some moments with Shane Harper and Trisha LaFache, I just can't recommend it to anyone. It doesn't even live up its debatable premise, because the direction is so careless and the writing is uneven. God's Not Dead has some interesting power-point presentations very well handled by its main character, but it is sad that the movie ended up being cheap Christian propaganda when it could be a more thought- provoking film. It is a very pretentious movie; and the ending could not be more selfish, disgusting and ridiculous. (D+)",

All the other characters are one-dimensional, unyielding in viewpoints, and there are a lot of different characters (some just left hanging). I expected and would like to have seen more discussion between Josh and professor in the classroom, which should have been the focus of the movie (probably took less than 20 minutes total), rather than side plots that had no bearing on the discussion, especially the sadistic ending. The movie fails to make any sense, but it looks good.To me it uses the classic tired old clich\u00e9 of the underdog vs. powerful authority figure- not unlike 'A Few Good Men' where the snot-nose junior lawyer (Tom Cruise) gets the powerful general to admit wrongdoing, not very believable. That was the weak part of that movie-same here.These screenwriters haven't a clue what an 'atheist' is. They also haven't ever heard of Lee Strobel's excellent movie \"The Case For A Creator\"- that movie (more of a documentary but completely engrossing) makes some very good points and makes sense without pushing Christianity like it's a used car. Since \"God is Not Dead\" was made by a Christian filmmaker, this is probably to be expected- but I would be embarrassed to be associated with this effort.So, if it's entertaining to see Christians pat each other on the back and put down other religions without any reasonable explanation- have faith- you'll love this movie. If you would like to see some intelligent discussion on religion- look elsewhere, don't waste time and money here.",

            "content": "before seeing this movie, many many times over, i kept on reading reviews, and people had a lot to go on. Christians and non said this was unrealistic on portraying non-Christians, celebrity appearances were very random, there was a strong lack of creativity (of course good theology was all there, though), and the only person to actually relate to was the \"mustache-twirling villain\" professor Radisson. Some of that's not true. Personally as a Christian, a gotta say i wouldn't have casted David A.R. White in, given his reputation for some indoctrinate decisions, and Willy Robertson isn't the greatest example as a Christian, given a few points of conversation on his show, though he's not bad enough to call hypocritical. Now going besides those points, the other problem i had was some of the dialog, because i don't think that the younger generation act the way the writers thought they do. And that one business guy, somehow needed some character development, but i understand their use of characters being stringed together around the whole movie. And it was made in a way for even little kids to understand. Creativity: maybe lacked somewhat, if not a lot. The character's developed well, from the Muslim girl, to the main character, to that one other girl, to the reporter, every situation that happened was realistic, even if some found it stereotypical or offensive. College professors of philosophy did use to go on and on against students' beliefs in God and how foolish it was, it probably doesn't happen as much today, but it still comes around. And the Muslim girl, i know people felt highly offended by that kind of thinking, but it can happen, in any type of home setting, and if you've ever known or heard of Islam the way it is, especially how it is in the middle east, you know it happens. Not that there aren't tolerant parents, I'm just saying that that would be a rare thing to find. This movie never pushed the idea of God on people like it's another essential next to math and science, it was more spoken out as the actual ability to choose God should be maintained. I started at the beginning of this movie and actually wondered of the fear of other people in life, i thought what would i do if my faith was challenged. if you're still wondering about this movie, you should know that the reviews will never make enough sense to describe this movie. It won't make any sense if you're a non-Christian, like \"the passion of the Christ\" or \"Narnia\" might, but if you're a Christian it should definitely strengthen your faith, even if it's just a movie, hold on to the idea that all has been proved, and wherever there is an opportunity that God gives, He definitely wants us to take it. Before watching, I thought the latest good Christian movie to show for anything recently would be 2013's Man of Steel. Yup, Pretty sure Zack Snyder specified things for us. Whole youth groups saw it together, even (watch the movie again, but keep that thought in mind). But this IS a good movie, no doubt one memorable. My last problem with it, though is the thought it had that might've made people think of a concert hall as a good replacement for church. Don't fall for that part in the movie, if you're gonna base your life on the movie in any way, don't do that part. They're not bad...they're just a different experience from actual church.",

If you think you'd enjoy that, you may greatly enjoy this movie. I thought it was going to be a movie with at least some slight level of balance, some doubt and uncertainty, which I find beautiful-- but in the end there was none at all.There are many comments about the awful portrayal of Muslims in the film, but it is a small issue related to the larger message of the film--that the evangelical Jesus is real and there is no other truth. In this light, being a Muslim is indeed bad because Muslims haven't been saved by Jesus yet. The film applies this to everyone that hasn't been saved by Jesus. In this world view, getting terminal cancer or being killed by being hit by a car are GOOD things because they are a way to get you to accept Jesus.

And I accepted that it was their choice not to believe and I left well enough alone.

All atheists are seen as bad and all Christians as good. This is simply not true as I personally know plenty of Christians who think they are great people and all they do is go to church.

His character and Dean Cain should have just been known as \"Bad Guy 1\" and \"Bad Guy 2\" with the reporter named \"Evil Liberal Media\". The \"struggling Christian student\" has no other dimension to his life really- We don't see his family, his academic struggles, him interacting really with any dimension of life nor do we even hear a decent debate from any character. The movie comes from a \"Christian victim\" perspective and that is how it is set-up. The girlfriend of the main lead is a walking contradiction- she goes to her third college choice for him (submission) and wants him to not ruffle feathers(domination)- AGAIN- poorly developed character. There is also a character we can assume is Muslim who finds Jesus and gets kicked out of her house. She wears the head covering(she covers her face) yet has exposed arms? Contradiction. Then the oddly placed exchange student who finds Jesus(unnecessary characters).There is this odd REV/Pastor who seems to not like his job and parrots religion. That character lacks any connection to anyone he \"helps\". I mean he relays scripture without any realistic worldly advice.(He reminds me of Mike Brady in the 2nd Brady Bunch movie) Lastly, none of the characters connected realistically. They should have dropped the Caucasian pastor and kept the missionary as the spiritual guide, dropped all other characters except \"victim Christian\", \"Evil Professor\", a decent needed love interest, and minor characters to interact with the main two. Keep the message. Bring the intellect. Lose the propaganda. Side note: My college experience was NOTHING like that. Professors get reported if they bully people and there is ALWAYS someone who would disagree in a class. The students are all dumb sheep by this movie's standards. Evil liberal colleges turning kids into atheists-clich\u00e9. Plus most the definitions given in the movie are inaccurate and the debate isn't fully at a college level. Its more like a sermon and a tirade by the professor. Flat and flavorless as a communion wafer.",

I just saw it at a packed cinema and at the end, many were applauding the movie as the credits rolled.While a student at Harvard University, there were many times that my faith was ridiculed and challenged by students and professors alike. Consequently, I was able to identify with the main character of the movie who had to defend his belief in God in his philosophy class. Granted that some of it was exaggerated in the film (but how many films are not exaggerated to prove a point?), it was still highly entertaining and enjoyable.It is true that most institutions of higher learning foster lively debate and openness. However, there are times when Christians are persecuted and discriminated for their beliefs. In fact, at the end of the movie, the credits displayed legal cases where Christians were forced to take their discrimination to court.As a Christian, I found the movie refreshing because we are able to identify with some of the characters. In fact, at times, we have been forced to take a stand for our beliefs. In short, non-believers may ridicule and mock all they want, but believers will laugh, cry, rejoice, and be uplifted by this movie.",

            "content": "Now without going into territory that shouldn't be treaded into, this isn't a movie. It's propaganda, congenial failure.First off: the characters, or rather: stereotypes this movie wants you to believe people actually behave like. All Christians are portrayed as clean cut, very nice, very polite people, while the atheists are shown as stupid, angry, snarling psychopaths that want to convince people that \"God is dead.\" Meanwhile, the Christians try to force the atheists to believe that God is real and that they should love him. Already, Christians and atheists alike should be offended. Knowing many atheists and Christians alike, literally none of them act this way. Its disgusting at how so many Christians think its okay for the movie to portray them in such a bad way. Same for the atheists. This was horrendous and offensive to see.2.) The plot and directing take the movie very little places. The movie almost has a great scene in which Josh, played by Shane, has the final argument with his professor. To his credit it is well executed, its passionate as it should be considering what he is doing. Then one line ruins it all: \"Science points to his existence.\" First off, the thing that is known for proving Josh wrong doesn't make it right if he says the opposite. Second, this shows that the script was written as a joke. No one with any knowledge from a church, where I spent many years of my life, or has read any amount of the bible would say this. Its insanely contradicting and confusing.3 and finally.) The writers straight up kill the professor. I'm not kidding. At the end of the movie, for no apparent reason, the professor gets hit by a car and dies, just as a preacher basically tells him that because he doesn't believe, he is getting killed for it. There is literally nothing I can say to that. Not a thing. Not because it was good, because it wasn't, but because it was so forced and unnatural, not to mention 100% unnecessary, that it didn't drive home any point or credibility the movie convinced itself it had. It just kind of portrayed God, the one person this movie spent so long trying to convince was a good person, as a huge jerk for no reason. Many people should be offended by this movie, whether your a Christian, atheist, or anything else. The only reason I gave it a one is because there's no negative stars.",

So many of the points brought out are ignored these days in the mainstream media, but I think we all know the reason for that.The quotes were good too: \"If God does not exist then everything is permissible.\" I always wondered how an atheist could be against murder if it served their purpose.

I wouldn't be offended by an atheist movie. I watch them all the time.Anyway, like I said, I almost didn't watch this just from the reviews.

It was right up my alley, giving equal weight to both sides of the argument. Unfortunately this was of course all just a set up and the film's true motives were soon revealed.It ends with unbearable cheesiness and I realised this film could quite possibly have been made by the church themselves. Anyone with half a brain will quickly see through this pathetic attempt to prove anything and will in fact realise that, if anything, this film gives more evidence towards atheism than anything else. Only saying you believe in God because you've got cancer or have been hit by a car and have moments to live speaks for itself really. No one actually believes there's a man in the sky, they just want there to be. I gave it a 3 rather than a 1 purely because of the early dialogue which had me captivated.",

            "content": "Wow, how bad can this be I thought before I started watching it, and I wasn't disappointed. You have the humanist reporter badgering the poor Ducky Dynasty star about duck hunting, You have the atheist lecturer who for someone reason makes everyone sign a note agreeing \"God is Dead.\" The student who refuses to sign, Josh Wheaton, it later tells some pastor that of the 80 or so people in there, none of them have really heard about Christianity? Really? None of them have heard about Christianity and Jesus? Did they wake up from a 2000 year coma? Wheaton in his debate about a god states that the Big Bang is evidence that the Bible got it right, because the Big Bang has a beginning to the universe and the Bible has a beginning. But Genesis is not about a Big Bang 13.7 billion or so years ago. It is a story of about 6000 or so years ago a deity making a flat earth that rested on pillars. A story where the sun and stars are made after light. Where insects don't have the right amount of legs. Hardly a representation of Genesis.Second, those fundamentalist Christians who like this movie, do not believe there was a Big Bang. So is Wheaton arguing for an old earth Christianity or even Deism (a god as a first cause) and if so, doesn't that go against the beliefs of those who pay to watch this movie?Josh Wheaton by the way, is asked by a fellow student, who created or what caused the bible? An excellent question by the way. Of course the response to this by theists/Christians is always, their god is uncaused. Really, what evidence for this exists? None. Wheaton asks, well aren't atheists burdened by the same question, what created the universe, just as Christians/theists are burdened by what created or designed a god? This is a part where I feel like slapping my head with my hand. We know a universe exists. It is there. It is all around us, in fact, we are in it now. We don't have the same knowledge of a god. One can always put in place of a god and say greenish invisible pink elephant with the paws of a lion. If someone says, who created this strange being, I guess someone like Wheaton could always respond, well doesn't the universe (which we know exists) need a creator, just like the greenish invisible pink elephant with the paws of a lion? See how silly this gets? Wheaton later states that Stephen Hawking is using circular thinking when Hawking writes, \"Since there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself out of nothing.\" No, that isn't a circular argument. It is stating that a cause, that being gravity, inevitably leads to a universe. Maybe Hawking should have stated it that way, but the way he wrote it is more poetic, but means just the same.Wheaton, quoting a Christian apologist states that evolution happened to fast at one point, which I think he means the so called Cambrian Explosion, though that is not mentioned in the movie. Actually the Cambrian explosion still took many, many millions of years for its' relative quick pace of evolution. Changes in the environment plus competition can favor great evolutionary change. For example faster antelopes lead to faster lions which lead to faster antelopes. If antelopes had no predators it wouldn't matter how fast or slow they might be. The competition in the early Cambrian favored fast (in terms of millions of years) change.The \"evil\" atheist professor, played by Kevin Sobo has a great line in the movie. \"The most committed atheists were former Christians who took the blinders off\". I was never a Christian, but a lot of atheists were Christians and like Neo from the Matrix, they come to understand that the Matrix (like a god) is a delusion.Of course Wheaton states in one of his debates that without a god, there can be no basis for morality. Leaving aside that the bible tells of a very, very, very immoral god who commands killing disbelievers and even so called disobedient children, there can be no basis for morality with a god. Is morality the whims of a god? If so, no absolute basis. Does a god use reason & empathy to derive moral rules, than a god is not necessary. Just any being who can utilize those tools.The professor in the end, Kevin Sabo, is basically killed by Jesus/God. See a car hits Sabo and a guy demands that Sabo find Jesus before he dies, than instead of say, give first aid. See Jesus put this guy who prays with Sabo by Sabo after he gets hit. Maybe Jesus could have placed a paramedic there instead, but that's just me.The fact is that every atheist in this movie is an jerk who finds religion before they die. It is just a straw-man attack on atheism and atheists. Kevin Sobo seems not to be able to answer the weakest arguments by this student. But I am sure the movie was beloved by many on the Christian right-wing.Comment Comment | Permalink",

As a non-believer (in the Judaeo-Christian deity), I really take offense with the many assumptions implied in this movie. Still that doesn't mean I don't like religious movies; I actually immensely enjoyed \"The Passion of the Christ\" and think it is a great work of cinematic art.GND though is anything but artistic but I'd like to address a few of its smug \"witticisms\". The protagonist triumphantly says to the professor \"How can you hate something that doesn't exist?\". Newsflash kid, I do hate things that don't exist in real life. For example, I hate the New 52 versions of the Justice League. I also hate Bayformers. Yes, you can hate something that don't exist.The other premise I'd like to address is the assumption that without the existence of a divine authoritarian being, there can be no room for morality or ethics as if Judeo-Christianity has a monopoly on morals. As pointed out in the kid's presentation, \"without god, anything is permissible\" which is pure hogwash. The old testament itself says that evil springs from God as can be seen in the misfortunes that befell Job. Also the bible describes countless barbaric acts: genocide, rape, murder, incest, human sacrifice perpetrated by God himself or his chosen people.Religion is nothing more than a method of mentally controlling the masses through fear and ignorance. People need to stop believing in these other-worldly delusions. It's all about giving in, submission, servility.That is not what life is about.",

            "content": "This movie is about a college professor asking his entire class to write \"God is dead\" on a piece of paper, then getting into a 3x20mins debate on the existence of God with one of the students who refuses.This is very unrealistic because real universities have real things to teach, even in philosophy class. Things like Boolean algebra, history of ethics, theory of knowledge, etc, etc. These classes are really hard, they require a lot of reading and thinking and logical reasoning. So the three words \"God is dead\" may seem to make sense to the common person, but in the context of philosophy you have to construct a formal framework on what is and what is not \"God\", what is the difference between \"is\" and \"is not\" and if something \"is\" then is it possible for something else to \"become\" that thing, and what is the nature of \"dead\" i.e. what can be \"dead\" and what can not be \"dead\". That's about 16 lectures worth of material right there, and we haven't even began exploring the meaning of the question yet. So the scenario as portrayed in the movie where the lecturer can causally take so much out of everyone's time to talk about such an ill defined proposition just doesn't happen. Unless if you sent your kid to one of those scam colleges who are more interested in making money than offering an education.There are good things about this movies though. There is no sex and violence, unlike literally every other movie out there. So that is commendable, there need to be more movies like this which try to appeal to an intelligent adult audience and not include obligatory sex scenes and violent scenes of people getting shot with blood splattered everywhere. So it was a pleasant viewing experience though I disagree with the message of the movie.Would I recommend you to see this movie? Yes, if you are a fundamentalist Christian living in small town USA and you feel you are somehow ridiculed and persecuted by atheists who want you to stop believing in God, then you will definitely love this movie.No, if you are not a fundamentalist but you are an ethical person living by moral principles, such as: churches shouldn't make money by giving false hope to people with terminal illness, no one should be abused at home because of their beliefs, all people should be tolerant of others, etc, then you will be offended by this movie, so I would recommend you go and watch something else.",

            "content": "If I wanted to watch a productive and thought-provoking debate on the existence of God, I would watch a proper debate between two qualified people who could represent their side of the debate well. It's a shame, because God's Not Dead could have shared similar merits; instead, its argumentative and horrifically biased approach made it worthless. I love arguments. I would gladly put down some money to see one, especially on a controversial topic such as religion. I love watching two people share and fight for their own perspectives. Unfortunately, God's Not Dead only showed one perspective, and even then it was poorly represented. I can't imagine Christians being proud to be represented in such a way; they were shown to be self righteous, arrogant, and imposing. So, the argument was one-sided. \"So what?\" one may ask. This is not unusual in film making - the film makers decide what to put in their film, after all. I wouldn't have opposed the film so vehemently if that were the only problem in the film's 'debate'. The real problem was that the logical fallacies were atrocious, and it made me want to yell at the screen. If I wanted to scream at something, I would watch American politics. Here's a list of logical fallacies found in the film: #1. Ad Hominem. Instead of attacking the professor's views (which were misrepresented to begin with), they attacked his personality. #2. Straw Man. This film should have been called, \"The Straw Man Isn't Dead\" or something like that. The atheist side was purposefully misrepresented, in order to make the Christian side look stronger. The arguments for atheism are very solid, so the misrepresentations came off as especially ridiculous. #3. Burden of Proof. No, the burden of proof is not on the atheists to prove that God does not exist. Josh Wheaton is a moron. There were plenty of other fallacies, but those were the one's that I had the most difficulty tolerating. When a film presents a one-sided argument, at should at least make it good! All in all, God's Not Dead is a horrible film. It could have been decent, if the debate was represented more accurately and presented some thought provoking arguments, but it didn't. God's Not Dead is a compendium of logical fallacies. Furthermore, the film was distasteful, and presented stereotypes which should never be presented outside of a comedic context. Why did they choose to make the Muslim father abusive and angry? Why did they show a Muslim turning to Christianity? Why did the pastor force his beliefs on the professor while he was dying? God's Not Dead is stupid, distasteful, and painful to watch. Avoid it.",

Kevin Sorbo will completely shock you with his performance in this movie. When I saw the trailer I'll admit one of my initial concerns for this film was their casting of Mr. Sorbo as Professor Radisson. I have nothing against Sorbo's work in the past (that I've seen) but I did not think he was cast correctly in the role. And boy was I wrong! His performance in this film absolutely redefined how I thought of him as an actor. He single-handedly added a layer of depth to this movie with his work and once you see it you will want to watch it again just because of how well he did with the role.David A.R. White and Marco Khan, neither of whom I've ever seen act before, were surprisingly good in each of their roles as well and Dean Cain played well to his strengths with the small role he had as well. These strong supporting performances really tie the film together in a special way with the solid script and some straightforward directing and an excellent soundtrack. Give this movie a chance. You will enjoy it.If you like this movie also watch one of these or if you like any of the following films you'll enjoy God's Not Dead: Flywheel, Fireproof, Facing the Giants, Courageous, Amazing Love, Mercy Rule, The Passion of the Christ, The Mission, Machine Gun Preacher, Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage, A Christmas Visitor.",

More often than not, religious films are not just kind of films. For the most part, however, \"God's Not Dead\" manages to steer clear to too much cheesy-ness and produce a pretty solid, thoughtful effort.For a basic plot summary, the concept of this movie revolves around Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper), a college student enrolled in a basic philosophy course. His extremely arrogant professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) wants the entire class to sign a waiver indicating that \"God is dead\", so they can move on to \"more important matters\". As a Christian, Josh will not sign his name, despite the fact that it will cause him so much trouble. He is tasked with proving God's existence to the whole class while steadily being harped on by the Prof.Besides that main plot line, there are a number of other \"spin-off\" mini-plots. If you've seen the movie \"Crazy Stupid Love\", it is that exact same kind of thing...exception played for religion instead of comedy. Everything kind of \"comes together\" in the end (all the stories converge on each other).The give-and-take between the student and professor is easily the highlight of the whole experience. It really gets to the heart of the religious-atheist differences that are constantly being debated to this very day. Of course, it does promote Christianity. That is something you have to understand going in. This isn't exactly a scientific treatise or anything. But for Christians who believe in the messages, it does a great job of conveying them.About the only reason I can't give it the full five star treatment? Besides the main two characters, some of the other acting in the film is less-than-stellar. I won't name names out of respect, but a few performances were so bad they actually took me out of the experience for awhile as it was all I could focus on.Overall, though, I very much enjoyed \"God's Not Dead\" as a Christian viewer. It is a movie that had a goal (to show audiences what many Christians believe when it comes to philosophical and world-creation topics) and accomplishes that goal very well. It manages to do that (and still get a major release and buzz) without dumbing down its message to pander to audiences. I respected that approach and enjoyed the experience.",

Only a few have the courage to stand up for what they believe.Judging by the majority of other reviews out there, it is obvious that most of the reviewers are themselves cowards who go along with the crowd, can't think for themselves, and repeat the same tired lines they probably heard for some college professor.",

I would assume it all started with a preteen's diary entry based on a first visit to a Christian youth summer camp.Although this movie makes every attempt to convey that Christianity is the only real choice, most men are bad unless they're lovable Christian goofs, and everyone else is an idiot or a violent idiot.; it really oversimplifies and reduces Christian ideals into an underdeveloped fiction of a hero that has missed the message he's desperately trying to explain to others.I quickly transitioned from interested, to offended by&for Christians, to laughing at how ridiculous this movie was. Luckily the movie showed how unintelligent it was quick enough that I was set up to laugh AT it before it became too offensive. Similar to watching a horror film that isn't supposed to be taken seriously or a unwitty and unintelligent version of a South Park cartoon, but certainly not as entertaining as either of those.",

So as a religious movie it's main goal is to state a message. So what is God's Not Dead's message you might ask? Well I'll tell you what I learned from God's Not Dead. To start with Christians are beautiful saints who are perpetually happy. They never do anything wrong and always know the right thing to do. Atheists on the other hand are are hateful and disgusting sociopaths who hate religious people because they themselves are secretly unhappy and are really only jealous of Christians and their happiness. I also learned from this movie that Muslims are terrible people who beat their children because Allah or something? Also everyone else is just a lost soul and aren't truly happy until they convert to Christianity. (This movie has a very simplistic view on things as it paints everything in black and white which is a tad bit disturbing to me) So in summary this movie paints gross generalizations to various groups and is just an overall bad movie. It's not worth watching unless you want an unsatisfying and slightly infuriating experience. There really are good religious movies but God's Not Dead is not one of them by any stretch of the imagination.",

I know there is more garbage to this movie then the three reasons I dislike it, but they are my reasons 1) They depict atheists as bullies and the one Muslim father as child beater (acting as if Christian don't do the same thing) and go as far as claiming that God is the only way in the life that is right (and they have been killing people for centuries just to prove that) 2) The argument that God is not dead is totally foolish and shortsighted. You can't prove that he is dead or even alive. Even if there is a God what's not to say he isn't Odin, Zeus or Ra? or even if God is a she like Freya or Athena.The third reason is what really sends my blood pressure through the roof 3) They make College professors look like villains,that critical thinking and getting a good education is bad,that a book written by a bunch of bronze-age goat herders can provide all the answers (which it can't)and that colleges are not only a bad place to be, but are places that silence a person's faith by doing something as stupid as expecting one to sign a piece of paper saying \"God is Dead.\" I have been a college student for many years. I have never once silenced me about my faith (even though I never brought up or had much of one either due to religious propaganda like this film) and I have to say that going to college is the best decision one can ever make. That is opposite of what this film represents and has done a very poor job of depicting what it means to go to college.

This movie is bad. Oh, some of the acting, here and there, isn't terrible. The folks behind the lighting and camera-work are on point. No, the failings of this film fall solely at the feet on the writers.The trouble is that there's absolutely no nuance. This is not surprising from a film that quite blatantly exists to advocate for a worldview. However, a more skillful writer tasked with the same project might have allowed the viewer some room to explore on their own the positions being explored, attempting to persuade in summary. The unfortunate but quite earnest folks tasked with penning these three reels of banality allow the viewer no such freedom, nor do they credit their audience with enough intellectual capacity to draw their own conclusions. If you subject you to this film you are, instead, blindered and led down a narrow path on a tight lead. The method the writers lean on is caricature. Anybody NOT a Christian in this script is a ridiculous stereotype, from an antitheist teacher who secretly believes in but despises God. I'm almost impressed they repressed the urge to give him a whiplash mustache to twirl. Or if you prefer, there's a Muslim father who forces the niquab on his daughter and believes everyone not Muslim to be an infidel. He strikes and throws his daughter out of his home upon finding a bible audiobook on her iPod. It's important to note that in the world being put forth in this script,there are no atheists at all. There are either people who turn their back on God or Muslims who, I guess, they see as being abusive believers in false gods. The narrow view of the writers leads to some unintentional hilarity, from the \"I Heart Evolution\" bumper sticker on the obnoxious liberal reporter's car, to a \"But Dad, I LOVE him!\" moment ripped straight from an 80's teen romance, substituting Jesus for the ubiquitous bad boy with an earring. The expected tropes are tediously trotted out.... the obnoxious liberal finds God after facing cancer, the antitheist finds God dying in the street when a pastor leads him in the Sinners Prayer.... any prior exposure to any cheap Christian media will have you knowing the conclusion to everybody's arc ten minutes into the first reel. It's pure tedium. For a movie apparently made to aid apologetics, there's no meat on the bone to feed any real discussion.It's a terrible movie, and whatever your belief on the Christian faith, you're likely to hate it. Give this one a pass. If you want something to engage your mind and your spirit, you won't find it here. Watch Inherit The Wind instead. That will give you ideas worth discussing.

            "content": "First, let's get it out of the way: this movie is nowhere near to achieving cinematic excellence. The only reason why I'm giving this a 10 is because of the amount of hate that it's receiving. Having said that, do I think it's a movie worth seeing? Sure, if you are at least to open about hearing about Christianity.That's why it's puzzling for me why some people who are not even remotely open to the faith who would watch it and dismiss it as Christian propaganda. After having watched the movie, I think it's targeted mostly to Christians to encourage to stand and testify for God. It's not meant to be a movie to make you sway your faith. No, it doesn't outline why you have to have faith in God. But rather, it challenges believers to do the most basic thing that we often neglect: to speak for Him.There are a lot of reviews here in IMDb (from who I presume are non-believers) calling this movie offensive, baseless and even \"dehumanizing\". One review called out the movie for \"demonizing\" non-believers and atheists because every character who's not a Christian were made out to be villains. But I would beg to differ. It didn't paint non-believers as heartless and cold. It showed that people have their reasons for not believing. It showed that people have their own story why they feel they need to be a certain way. Kevin Sorbo's character spent all his life disproving the existence of God because his prayers were not answered the way that he wanted it to be answered. The father who has thrown away his own daughter because she decided to be Christian, was shown to be torn between the love for his daughter and his own faith. Dean Cain's character who was disconnected and focused in accumulating as much wealth and success was remorseful for an overbearing mother who was only trying to bring him to the faith. There's a degree of truth in all of these stories. No way that the movie showed that all these characters were made out of cardboard or showed them as one-dimensional.There was also someone claiming to be a minister reviewed this film and said that it's just a bad movie and more of a propaganda more than anything. He even went to make a call for Christians to stop making movies like this. This just saddens me. He was expecting Christian movies to just focus on salvation. While it's the central message that we Christians should be attesting to, I don't think Christian movies should be confined to this one message. This movie, I find, is very timely when most Christians just confine to the belief of the world to \"get along\". Don't get me wrong. I'm not calling for us to shove the truth down the non-believers' throats. But we have to stand up for Him and know when our faith is challenged. The problem arise when Christians force our doctrines to non-believers and condemn them for their way of life. And there was a line in the movie that hit the nail on its head: you don't have to defend Christ, it's enough that you speak for Him. We are called to testify, not to pass judgment. We are not called to hate non-believers but rather show them love and forgiveness is possible.This movie is not intended to put the spotlight on the non-believers but rather it turns the mirror on brothers and sisters in faith: to be reflective on how we conform and blend with the world.So as a final word of caution: If you're not a Christian and you're looking for a movie to explain the basis of our faith, this is not the movie for you.",

My best advice is to pay no attention whatsoever to any of the negative reviewers on this movie.First, the acting was solid. Second, the dialog is crisp, and clear. The intent and the message come through solid. I've seen many reviewers claim that this entire thing is a \"Setup.\" Believe me, I've seen many events like this happen in real life, and know that God indeed does move exactly the way the film describes. In fact, I could tell you stories that would make your hair stand up. But I won't, since this review is about this movie.Suffice it to say, it is all completely within the realm of possibility in God's economy as we like to say in Christian circles. I'm ashamed of all those on here claiming to be Christians, even some claiming to be Pastors who negatively reviewed this movie. It's extremely well scripted, well thought out and well executed in my opinion.We all of us know that College campuses across America have become havens for liberal thought, taking their god-less message to those who are most vulnerable, the young and impressionable. That type of thinking has invaded our primary and secondary schools as well, to the point where the liberals think they have won the victory over the hearts and minds of our children.What do we reap as a benefit of all that you might ask? Teen drug and alcohol use that is out of control. Teen pregnancies that have crept upwards in both numbers and percentages for many years, only to be knocked down in the past couple years by \"Morning after\" pills that kill the baby in the girl's womb before it ever gets a chance to start growing. We have teen suicide rates that are among the highest in the world. And we have an entire generation of young people enslaved by both the entitlement mentality as well as the \"I must be entertained\" philosophy. These kids growing up haven't a clue what life is really all about, and they sure aren't encouraged by a liberal philosophy that claims we came from nothing and return to nothing when we die.Christianity defends itself, as this movie so aptly points out. Those who won't listen or can't hear the truth of Christ's message, the Gospel (good news), are blinded by their own desires and lusts and they choose to try to poke holes in it rather than investigate it and find out for themselves whether or not the claims of the Bible are true.I grew up in the liberal school system. In Los Angeles, in the 1960's. I was a drug user and an alcoholic. I have lived the hedonistic pleasure-centered life-style where I myself was god, and the only choices in life were how best to fill my needs on any particular day. I am here to tell you that life is a lie. The biggest lie in history is that you can live for yourself and not care anything about anyone else! That life is meaningless, and shallow and will lead only to the one place that all the liberals don't want you to hear about: Hell.So, to all those who scoff and doubt, I can only repeat the title of this movie, that says it all: \"God's Not Dead!\"",

The young man who portrayed the student in question who was forced to defend his faith was also excellent. Even this young man's girlfriend, also a believer in God also presented a challenge to him. This also leads into the main plot element of the movie that is - a believers' largest challenge in life may not always come from \"outside the faith\".

I wish more followers would take up this mantle.I think the film had strong and somewhat harsh views of both atheism and Islamic/Muslim faith, but the truth is... those extreme presentations are a reflection of some people out there, it helps dramatize and allow you to empathize with characters. Right or wrong, the movie wouldn't have been as good if it only showed kind and tolerant people on all sides of the argument... nor would it have had any realism.I gave it a 9 because it is family friendly and very entertaining.

All of our protagonist's arguments for the existence of God are completely nonsensical and can be debunked by simple rational thought. All of the subplots are almost worthless and add nothing to the story. The acting and writing are beyond terrible. And to top it off, this film subscribes to the insane notion that Christianity, the world's leading religion, with over 2.2 billion followers, is somehow under attack. The only good things I can say about the film are that the cinematography, directing, and editing are decent and the score, minus the song at the end, is at least passable.

Personally, I didn't find it offensive, but it almost made my blood boil that Christian fundamentalists are using Hollywood as a platform to push their religious propaganda to young people, hoping to infect them with the mental virus of Christianity. I liked the idea of a movie about a \"God\" debate, but from the very beginning, the writers went out of their way to establish who's the bad guy and to make them look so bad, that it almost looked like a Mexican soap opera.

            "content": "Christophobia on campus is all too real. I have attended faculty meetings that open with professors making the most egregious comments mocking Christian students. I have helped students who were harassed and bullied by professors once they made their identities as Christians known. I know of cases where hiring committees did look askance at applicants after discovering that they were Christian. I have seen hostile professors mock not just Christians, but also devout Muslims for belief in God. I have heard reports of devout Jews also being openly ridiculed in university settings. \"God's Not Dead\" was a profound let-down. Christophobia on campus is a real problem, and it deserves better treatment than this ham-fisted, simple-minded, sadistically triumphalist film. \"God's Not Dead\" opens provocatively. Josh (Shane Harper) a college freshman, takes a class with a professor (Kevin Sorbo) who requires his students to write \"God is dead\" on a piece of paper. Josh refuses to do so. He and the professor square off. The professor challenges Josh to convince his fellow students of God's existence. Harper and Sorbo are both good in their roles. The film's premise is excellent. The film does almost nothing with it. Instead, through choppily edited scenes, it juggles several strands of subplots. A Muslim college girl converts to Christianity and her father reacts with hostility and heartbreak. An American minister wishes he were in Africa, but learns, through a providentially malfunctioning car, that life here in the US presents important challenges. A reporter having an affair with a callous, selfish man gets some bad news about her health. An elderly woman has Alzheimer's. Her daughter is involved with \u0085 the arrogant, atheist university professor. Two Duck Dynasty TV stars appear; this celebrity scene took me out of the movie completely. There is a concert with a Christian rock band called the Newsboys. The duel between the frightened but determined college student and the arrogant professor was the most promising plot thread. It could have made a great, great movie. Instead the script fritters this contest away. It is never developed. For me the most moving scene from the various subplots was also one of the most obvious and ham-handed. In a darkened room, a woman who is otherwise rendered senseless by Alzheimer's suddenly delivers a powerful sermon about how Satan can keep people trapped in comfortable prison cells. Commentators have blasted the movie for depicting a Muslim father reacting with hostility to his daughter's conversion to Christianity. In fact Marco Khan depicts the father with great sensitivity. He obviously loves his daughter and he wants to protect her from negative influences. When he learns of her conversion, he is practically in tears. This is a complex and human character, not a hateful stereotype. I won't reveal the end of the movie here, except to report that it is shameless. The movie handles the atheist professor shamelessly. This ending portrays God as much more shallow than he could ever be. \"God's Not Dead\" struck me as a film that reflects some of the, to me, less attractive features of modern American Evangelical Protestantism. I reflected on Catholic films that, I think, handled issues of faith in deeper, more complex, more human ways. I'm thinking of pop movies like \"Going My Way\" and \"Bells of Saint Mary's,\" blockbusters like \"Sound of Music\" and Fred Zinnemann's 1959 classic, \"The Nun's Story.\" These films show all the ups and downs, the pimples and pockmarks, the real-life roadblocks, mazes, and dark nights of the soul of a life of faith. In \"Bells of Saint Mary's,\" a pacifist nun teaches a bullied boy how to box. In \"Sound of Music\" faith goes up against lust and Nazism. In \"The Nun's Story\" the atheist, Dr. Fortunati, is an ally of a person of faith. In \"God's Not Dead,\" all the Christians are purely good, and all the non-Christians are close to being purely bad. In \"God's Not Dead,\" it seems all you have to do is say, \"God is good all the time\" and presto changeo, even cars obey God's will to make your life better, and everything ends up as a triumphant sing-along.",

            "content": "As an atheist, I was skeptical when watching this film, and there are three major things that irked me, despite the obviously Christian agenda of the story. 1. The portrayal of atheists as belligerent, insecure, self- righteous, coercive, unlawful, jealous, bigoted, mean-spirited bastards. Not okay. Blatant bigotry. And let's not forget that the professor in real life could have well undergone disciplinary charges, especially if it was a public university. 2. The portrayal of Muslims and the Chinese was paper thin and just as full of bigotry. As an atheist, I too criticise Islam and the totalitarian atheist regimes, but the use of convenient stereotypes to promote the agenda of this film is clearly not okay by any means. 3. The obnoxiously easy conversions. For me personally, the de- conversion process took YEARS. The acceptance of powerful arguments in this regard seems to be a slow process. It is simply not credible for such a deep change in ideology in the other direction to take so little time as the film portrays. So, yes, we can talk about the enormously wicked act of trying to convert a dying man instead of helping him live, about the bitchy girlfriend and the stupid point that atheism is just a hatred of God, but over all, these three things are what irked me the most. Thoroughly forgettable. Gave it a 2 out of 10 because I'm kind.",

            "content": "One need not spend any more time in this movie than the opening scene to get a feel for how they will spend the rest of the movie: uncomfortable. Right from the opener, we're introduced to most of the actors we're going to deal with. Aside from the protagonist, Josh Wheaton, everyone else is presented as miserable or aloof or unfortunate or struggling or some other state of dismal and uptight. The difference? Josh wears a cross around his neck.Anyone desiring to watch this movie will know from the hype around it or basic plot summary this film uses a linear Christian vs. atheist platform. They probably expect to get some thinking points or mild entertainment from it, but let me assure you that the intended audience is not you. This film was created as a blankey- and-pacifier for the groomed, self-righteous Christian who views themselves as a neo- martyr fettered by a licentious and brazen anti- God society. It serves more as a call to war than as a reasonable conversation held between two sides. And everyone who isn't a Christian is the enemy.I can't think of a film that offended me more than this one, and it accomplished that by the time our protagonist and antagonist had their first encounter. Though, to some credit against a lot of reviews that decry Mr. Raddison's approach, I've met philosophy instructors who challenged people in exactly the same fascist style offered in this film. But even with the initial conflict comes the reality that a billion different options were present for Josh, and he chose the most confrontational one possible. Of the stereotypes presented, I'd say the one employed for the neo-martyr Christian's approach to those in disagreement with them was perhaps the most accurate. That, and the unapologetic monologue offered by Willie Robertson near the start, which did everything but give him wings and a halo, best demonstrated the reason for my sentiments of discontent every time I get done talking to someone who's a fan of Duck Dynasty.I'd like to qualify my sentiments as thus: I am a Lutheran by upbringing. I have my own relationship with God and frequently engage in the conversation with atheists paramount to this film's plot. I frequently find myself upset with the scripted circular- logic sentiments offered by the common atheist (as well as those from the average self-identifying Christian).And furthermore, I found it quite ironic that the person they chose to represent a \"God-hating atheist\" is Kevin Sorbo, whose career was largely spent as Hercules. For those of you who are not familiar with this fact, watch the first season of Hercules, then watch this film. For the rest of you who are familiar, just pretend like he still is playing that role.",

And YES, they don't want to broaden their appeal and seek out a new audience. I get all that. For many of these multiple story lines, they're neutral as I would like to see them. Unfortunately, they weren't perfect\u0085as most good Christians would explain their actions.The movie's weak, time-padding premise revolves around Josh, a Christian who takes a Philosophy college course with the worst teacher in the history of colleges. The \"atheist\" teacher challenges \"Freshman\" Josh to prove God is not dead. Then the teacher gets upset when Josh proves this. Sorta. I actually call it a Fail. That's one of many subplots. Mostly, this movie paints a very dark picture of atheists and Christians are always the martyr. Now don't go getting upset with Michael Moore when he makes a \"documentary\" and only states his side.Sometimes, while watching this, I sided with the Christians, but then, when they pointed out how anyone NOT-Christian is, simply, a bastard, it was hard to back them.The movie was low-budget and made specifically for one audience, I get that. But, it didn't have to be so incompetently made. Scenes just abruptly started and stopped and after the too-long runtime, it just stopped being opened-minded and gave only the Christian's POV.In all, this movie is false. Josh's statements and arguments is hardly a real case. Basically, it boils down to faith. You cannot prove faith, like the absolute premise of this movie would like you believe. You just have to feel it. I wouldn't recommend this movie since it wasn't 100% committed to being open to both sides. It almost did; there were moments someone could make up their own mind, but then it shifted back to only believing one way. There are no Black & White areas in life. Sorry. That's the truth.***Final thoughts: Finally, I watched this from beginning to end. I've seen many YouTube reviews on this where they pointed out many, MANY, flaws and consistently laughed at it. I've seen so many video reviews of this, I truly felt I've seen the whole movie already.In truth, I basically had. But, I thought I would finally give it an unbiased go-at-it on my own.

As the movie pointed out, God is the foundation of our moral being. Without God, there would be no right or wrong, and one could pretty much do anything they wish to further their own life, regardless of the consequences to those around them. And is that how we're supposed to live? The classic atheistic argument \"How could a loving God permit such evil\", was addressed in the simplest terms - Free Will. Trusting in God despite our circumstances gives us the peace to endure them. How sad for those who, when faced with a traumatic, life-threatening situation, have no hope beyond this mortal existence. This movie is a must-see for everyone, and God will touch the hearts of those who are even remotely open to listen.",

As a Christian, I have personally struggled with the questions addressed in this movie about God's existence and the nature of evil, and so I agree they're relevant and important to discuss. But rather than watch \"God's Not Dead,\" I would strongly recommend either Lee Strobel's \"The Case for Christ\" or Timothy Keller's \"The Reason for God.\" A hypocritical movie simply cannot do these issues justice.Why do I call it hypocritical? Because it's more close-minded than the atheists it vilifies. Why does the story about the Muslim family look so familiar? Probably because it's the most stereotypical thing I've ever seen. Should you encounter a young Muslim girl covering her head, be warned\u0085 her father's oppressive and/or abusive. That's the message of this film! I've said it before and I'll say it again. If Christ were to retell the story of the Good Samaritan in today's culture, it would probably be called the Good Muslim.As for the atheists\u0085 There are three represented in this film. The professor, the reporter, and Dean Cain's character. Two out of the three of them come to Christ (the professor and the reporter). Why do they come to Christ? Because they're both facing a painful, imminent death. Seriously!? Their faith isn't based on Christ's sacrificial love \u2013 it's based on their fear of an eternity in hell. So, if you want to \"save\" atheists, this movie seems to recommend hitting them with a car! Hopefully they'll live just long enough to accept Christ, and then we can all celebrate. For the record, THAT IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY OKAY!Believe me, I can go on. The professor's girlfriend? Yes, I'm glad she found the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship\u0085 but was she so vindictive that she had to humiliate the guy in front of his colleagues? Sure, he probably deserved it, that's not the point. Christ calls us to a higher standard. I'm not saying that Christians need to be perfect\u0085 but there are consequences to our actions, and in this case, a man gets hit by a car. As my brother said, \"I'd love to see how she responds to the news of his death.\" But, knowing the scriptwriters, she'll probably just smile and thank God for His \"mercy.\"Seriously, this film is disgusting.

            "content": "Short summary: I cringed, snickered, and giggled during this movie more than I tend to do over most actual comedies. It really is THAT staggeringly silly.Spoiler alert: the 'God' in this movie is, of course, Jesus. No other gods, religions, or philosophies past, present, or future need apply for a lease on life, as far as this movie's thinking goes (however generous a word like 'thinking' might be in this context.)In any case, the movie starts with and centers around an utterly inane setup: nobody who's ever actually been to a university, much less in fact taken a real philosophy class, would find it remotely plausible. This movie embodies the stereotypical bogeyman of a liberal left ivory tower full of vacuous and intellectually corrupt -- and/or emotionally damaged -- academic elitists, fond of incessantly stroking and congratulating each other, and bent on forcefully indoctrinating our vulnerable and upstanding Christian youth with anti-Biblical teachings and notions. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that if this movie actually represented reality, conservative radio talk shows might have had a point, for once.The 'professor' character is a grotesquely silly caricature. He is consumed with a stereotypical 'atheist' vendetta against a 'God' he claims not to believe in (seriously!) His argumentative arsenal consists exclusively of appeals to authority and personal insults -- this, from a 'brilliant' PHILOSOPHY 'genius' (the movie's own characterization!) He's also really quite a shallow and insecure, self- centered jerk. Rather incredible, for someone whose very profession is founded upon the discipline of careful, clear, and deep contemplation.Next, we have this humble college freshman who -- pursuing the calling of his faith -- in his spare time between classes, reads dozens of books and puts together slick-looking video presentations that would make any multimedia specialist and/or professional lecturer proud. While at it, he misrepresents some science, and gives voice to some rather weak and easily refutable sophistry -- which, of course, in the movie goes unchallenged as if it were some kind of gospel.There are some miscellaneous characters and side-stories, intertwining with each other, and basically all constructed around various people coming to Jesus one way or another. Which is, in the end, the movie's entire and solitary message.Sprinkled throughout, there are oodles of horrible dialog, stiff or just plainly bad acting, ridiculous choices, misplaced priorities, unbelievable scenarios, irrelevant and silly attacks on some imaginary caricature of the political left, and inane outbursts from various characters who have not yet found their way into the light -- all of which in aggregate, in my view at least, constitute the only somewhat fun aspect of this movie (even if likely representing a typical evangelist's wet dream...)All of it is dressed in a light-drenched palette of pastel sets and wardrobes, colorless musical score, and ho-hum cinematography.In an intellectual sense, this movie left me with an unsavory sensation of having spent an hour and a half watching a cast of characters deliberately masturbate themselves and each other on-screen for public edification. Really, if this movie is the \"Bible-thumper\" (another reference from the movie) answer to atheism, then the Biblical god, at least, if not altogether dead is not only in critical condition and on full life support, but a brain-dead vegetable to boot.Yet, I get the sense that this movie's sermon is calibrated for and targeted squarely and solely at the eager and ready choir. Unless you are a card-carrying member, it's unlikely you will find this experience either entertaining or worthwhile.",

            "content": "God's Not Dead is a very important movie. It's also one of the worst and most frustrating I've seen in a long time.It's a film that brings out an interesting debate that needs to be addressed. The world deserves a movie like this, where the debate between theism and atheism is explored. But the world also deserves a much better, unbiased script.From a technical standpoint, the film is absolutely embarrassing. It is almost impossible to judge the performances, due to the weak dialogue. It is immediately clear that every word in the film was written by one person, taking away any notion of character. This is especially obvious with the terms \"intellectual suicide\", \"academic suicide\", etc. The best acting comes from Willie Robertson, who plays himself, which gives me serious concerns with the validity of his already established, carefully constructed reality show (of which I consider myself an occasional viewer).Pacing and structure are thrown off by varying subplots and cameos, such as Robertson's, and the third act takes forever to accomplish anything. The cinematography is uninspired, and it gives the film a resemblance to the average Hallmark channel flick.So how about the story and the message?The opening image introduces us to the movie's weakly connected characters. Our hero, a college freshman named Josh, shows up on campus with a youth group girlfriend, a Newsboys T-Shirt, and a cross necklace. He's a good kid, if you weren't aware.20 minutes in, and after at least three Newsboys references, I made a realization. 'Oh goodness, this movie is going to end at a Newsboys concert.' I'm no psychic. Maybe the filmmakers were trying to use the endless references as foreshadowing. Or they needed backing and funding to complete the film (looking at you too, Duck Dynasty). I guess we'll just never know\u0085Josh, a college freshman (don't forget), goes to his first class: Introduction to Philosophical Thought with Satan himself, disguised as atheist Professor Radisson. Right off the bat, the situation loses credibility when Radisson tells the class that God is dead, and that this is indisputable fact. He goes on to require every student to write the words \"God is dead\", sign it, and turn it in. Rude professors probably exist, but this example is simply not believable. This is not a character. This is an entity that the audience is blatantly made to hate.When Josh, a mere college freshman, refuses to write \"God is dead\", Radisson gives him a choice: write the words, or prepare a defense for God's existence, using 20 minutes of the next three classes to make his case to the entire class. This sets forth the entire structure of the main plot: Josh presents, and Radisson rebuttals. Miraculously, Josh happens to have the public speaking skills of Barack Obama (after unconvincingly stumbling through the first, I don't know, ten seconds?) Conveniently, all of Radisson's negating rebuttals fit neatly into Josh's following slides, causing quite the stir in the impressionable classroom.The film has no problem with trivializing every world view that is not its own. The numerous subplots make this very clear, all while being lazily intertwined. Josh's Chinese classmate is introduced to Christianity, which is a relief, knowing that whatever he learned previously was from his godless, angry father. A mean-spirited, liberal, animal-loving, atheist reporter learns that she has cancer, while her mean-spirited atheist boyfriend neglects her in favor of his business ventures, further establishing that a nice atheist is a paradox. This man's sister, a Christian, has a mother with dementia, and is a former student of (husband/boyfriend?) Professor Radisson. This sets up a relationship that could never possibly happen (including some absurd dialogue), culminating in a scene where Radisson's atheist dinner party colleagues blatantly treat the lone Christian in the room like an outcast step-child that Radisson might as well keep in a cupboard under the stairs.Sympathy points. Sympathy points everywhere.On the flip side, a pastor and a missionary are involved in an odd subplot about a car not starting because the pastor doesn't have enough faith. When the missionary prays about it, lo and behold, the car starts. From this, we learn that if you pray for something, you get what you want\u0085 Seriously, if they pray and the car still doesn't start, do they just give up their entire lifestyle? Prayer could possibly bring the remembrance of a local mechanic to the pastor's mind, but prayer doesn't miraculously replace a belt.Most offensive is the subplot of a girl who grows up in a Muslim household, escapes to her room to listen to Christian podcasts, and begins to commit her life to Jesus. Her brother, harnessing his telekinetic anti-Christian powers, bursts into her room, steals her iPod, and learns that his sister is turning her life over to Jesus. Her traditional father finds out, and of course, as all Muslims would react, beats her and kicks her out of the house. I honestly have no idea why this subplot would be included. It shows complete ignorance towards an entire religion.But the filmmakers know that Muslims are most likely not going to see the film. All the filmmakers care about is the Christians who question the morality in today's world, and the Christians that feel persecuted. And, according to the movie, all 'Christians' are understanding and compassionate, like Josh (a college freshman, in case you forgot).Oh wait, except for one: his girlfriend.(Not enough space.

This misses the whole point of a movie. A movie isn't supposed to affirm your beliefs, no matter how petty they are. All this film does is preach to an audience that they know will buy tickets too, instead of creating something original. Had they gone for the latter, they could have truly explored why some people lose faith and why some people keep their faith. This film completely undermines its audience by assuming they are all idiots, which most of them are and need to be spoon fed a happy story about how the good Christian defeated the evil atheist in a debate.

            "review_title": "Too simplistic, but still some good movie moments!",
            "content": "God's Not Dead has some good moments...my teen son was engaged with the movie and was moved by parts of it. However, he noted some of the script/drama flaws, notably that there are too many sub plots. I agree with some others here...that the characters are portrayed too simplistically. Notably the high powered business man (played by Dean Cain) automatically dumps his girlfriend (Trish LaFache) when she says she has cancer. Really? Some guys might be that shallow, but probably his gradual pulling away would have been more realistic...And the college professor who demands a signed \"anti belief\" signed statement from his class of 80...I find that demand a bit unrealistic. Also, more than one person surely would have pushed back against signing the statement! His character is also weakly drawn. His purported academic brilliance collapses way too easily against the young student's researched comments.However, parts of the professor/student engagement rings true. This was the best part of the film...hearing the student present some important sources to show that atheists do not have reality/the origins of the world \"all settled\".My college age daughter (and other students I have heard about) do sometimes face anti-God propaganda...in their supposedly secular (i.e. supposedly neutral) college. Notably at her college, a Jewish professor was hounded (through protests and articles) by some students of other faiths who disagreed with some things he said. They could have countered his statements with solid research but as far as I ever saw, they hammered him with protests... (argument ad baculum...Smack 'em with the club). I think the college caved to their badgering...instead of caving in to well-reasoned rebuttals of his assertions.And there are many cases (probably many, many more than listed at the end credits) where students or professors had to go to court to protect their right of free speech/belief. Not sure his case went to court, but just ask highly credentialed Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez how badly he was treated by his past university??? (See \"Expelled-No Intelligence Allowed\" for more documented cases of academic tyranny against those holding unfashionable views/theories/faiths.)Some students' arguments/sources are ignored or merely belittled on popular atheist sites/or by some professors who substitute their opinion or their favorite source as \"the final word\"...instead of encouraging students to research and examine for themselves.Dean Cain and Trish LaFache play a couple...a high powered businessman and an upscale far left \"gotcha\" reporter/blogger. After she announces she has cancer, he immediately dumps her. I suspect a more realistic scenario might be that he gradually withdraws from her...instead of immediately dumping her. There is a touching scene which seems fake but is actually medically probable where Dean Cain's character visits his mother (who has dementia--). In one short clear moment, she speaks of her faith, and the comfortable self-imposed prison he is in...and then she relapses back into her dementia. Because there are too many coincidences in the film, this possible scenario (her one clear moment) also looks contrived.Another part which seems \"fake\" but which has happened to someone my daughter knew...was when the female college student is discovered to be a Christian and is tossed out by her devout (probably Islamic) family. Not all families would reject a daughter who converts to Christianity, but it does regularly happen. (Search the Net.)The minister is played well by David A.R. White...but the many cars not starting --which work to prevent his vacation--is a bit unbelievable. So...yes those not knowing God will be exposed to some great music (Newsboys)...and to some good to great arguments for the existence of a Creator...in a moderately entertaining film. And the film will encourage students to not accept professors as \"semi deity\". But this fairly good film could have been better written had they made their characters more complex.",

There was a Muslim girl in the movie, so I thought there was going to be an exploration of various beliefs, but nope. I watched this movie to see what arguments could be given to convince others of the existence of God, like perhaps personal experience or divine daily guidance, but nope, it was a lot of quoting of Darwin, Stephen Hawking and other scientists and philosophers, as if thinking and doing mathematics in itself constitutes proof. Anyway, this movie does not encourage one to think or to question. When you get to the end, you realise this was one big preachfest, where the whole class of atheists suddenly believe in God and \"accepts Jesus\", not because they had an experience or communication with God or Jesus, but just because one student said so. I can't even remember what he said, I fell asleep so many times.Comedic moments: A Muslim girl covers her face, but the moment she steps out of the car, she is dressed in tight, figure-hugging clothes. LOL! Then there was the Chinese international student who phones home to his father. The son speaks Cantonese while the father speaks a heavily-accented Mandarin (obviously from two regions very far apart). The producers can't even be arsed to find out what people of other religions and cultures wear and speak, they are just hell-bent on getting to the final Christian worship/concert.

            "content": "Once I have decided to watch a movie, there is only one piece of information I want to know in advance, which is when the movie was made, because that provides the context that might be needed to appreciate the movie and understand it. Of course, I already have other pieces of information in advance, such as the title, but basically, I like to watch the movie without having any more advance knowledge than necessary.There is, additionally, my reason for selecting the movie for viewing. In particular, I recently decided to watch movies that featured an atheist as a prominent character, in order to see how the treatment of atheism has evolved in a hundred years of American cinema. Naturally enough, \"God's Not Dead\" (2014) was on my list.Normally, when I review a movie, it is neither necessary nor desirable to talk about myself. But this calls for an exception. I majored in philosophy in the late 1960s, and my favorite philosopher was Friedrich Nietzsche, who was the one who originally said, \"God is dead.\" Needless to say, I was an atheist and have been ever since, although now my favorite philosopher is Arthur Schopenhauer.The movie is set on a college campus. Josh Wheaton is a freshman. (I wonder how long it will be before we start designating first-year college students as \"freshpersons.\") He signs up for an introductory course in philosophy. He is warned by another student not to take the course from Professor Radisson, but he is undeterred. During the first class, Radisson says he doesn't want to waste time debating the existence of God, so he demands that every student in the class write \"God is dead\" on a piece of paper and sign it. Josh refuses to sign it. I must admit, Nietzschean atheist though I was, I wouldn't have signed it either, but for very different reasons.Radisson tells Josh that for twenty minutes in the next three classes, he will have to defend the proposition that God exists, with the implication that if he fails in this endeavor, he will flunk the course. On the first day that he has to defend his belief that God is not dead, Josh essentially advances the cosmological argument for the existence of God, which is that an eternally existing God is needed to explain how a contingent world arose out of nothingness in a big bang. On the second day, he advances the teleological argument for the existence of God, also known as the argument from design. The thrust of this argument is that God is needed to explain life. Evolution alone will not suffice. On the third day, he addresses the problem of evil, in which the all the sin and suffering of this world seems to be inconsistent with the existence of an all-powerful, loving God. His answer is that evil is the price we pay for having free will, which includes the freedom to accept Jesus as our savior, which will allow us to dwell in Heaven for eternity. He also presents the moral argument for the existence of God, which is that God is needed as a foundation for morality.Na\u00efve me. I thought that Radisson's presentation on the first day was just a pose. I thought what would happen was that in the end, Radisson would give Josh an A for having the courage of his convictions, for being able to defend his views in front of the classroom, knowing that he was being judged by a militant atheist. Boy, was I wrong! That became clear after the first presentation, when Radisson becomes physical and threatening, presumably because he feels threatened by Josh. (Maybe I should have suspected something when I saw Radisson's goatee, which is often seen in popular images of the Devil.) After the third day, Josh gets the better of Radisson when he asks him why he hates God, and we find out that he hates God because God let his mother die when he was young. Then Josh asks him how he can hate someone who doesn't exist. Golly! Radisson never thought of that.The rest of the movie shows how sweet and wonderful Christians are, and how mean and selfish atheists are, including Chinese communists. Of course, not everyone who believes in God is sweet and wonderful. You have to believe in the real God, because a Muslim kicks his daughter out of the house when he discovers she is an apostate who secretly listens to sermons on Christianity.Radisson is hit by a car, receiving fatal injuries. But that's all right, because God kept Reverend Dave in town by not allowing any car he got into to start until he was needed at that intersection where Radisson was hit. And so it is that in the long tradition of atheists in movies, Radisson repents and lets Jesus into his life just before he dies.I learned something from watching this movie. I learned that it was made by Pure Flix Productions, a company that specializes in the genre of Christian paranoia, and it does so with a simple-mindedness that makes Sunday school look like a Jesuit seminar. At the beginning of this essay, I said that I try to keep my knowledge about a movie to a minimum before I watch it, except for such things as the title and the date in which the movie was made. I now add one more item to that list. From now on, before I watch a movie, I want to know if it was produced by Pure Flix, because if it was, there is no way I will subject myself to another movie like this one.",

That would have been a mistake. A friend changed our minds about seeing the film.We chose to see this one as our theater experience of the year. We will not get to see another film in the theater as we live in Honduras where we run a home for children.After reading the reviews, my wife and I were prepared for stereotyped roles and simplistic writing. There was maybe a tad of that, as there is with any story you try to fit into a two hour film. Filmmakers do not have the luxury that book writers enjoy, of extended character development time.I had read a review about the Muslim father being a stereotyped, heartless Muslim who hates his daughter after he finds that she is listening to Christian media. However, the movie shows a father who is really torn up about the situation. It was not unbelievable.Getting an atheist to confess that he hates God, though they profess to not to believe in God, might be a little more difficult than it was portrayed on the film, but again, on a film you are limited by time. However, I believe that hate is the root cause of atheism. I've been there, done that.Probably the least believable role to me was, for lack of a better term, the \"secularist\" woman who was diagnosed with cancer. Her interview questions seemed over the top, snarky. I suppose people like that exist, but I live kind of sheltered out on a central American mountaintop.As for the entire class changing their minds on the existence of God, in some respects that was not realistic, except for the fact that they seemed to be going with the flow. The fact that they all began the class signing a paper stating that \"God is Dead\" without visible concern showed that they had no strong conviction one way or the other. That actually does seem apropos. More than likely you could ask a roomful of college students if they believe God created the universe and you would not see many hands. At the same time, you would not find many in the audience if they have ever attended church. The church is full of Sunday bench warmers who are there because someone else, typically a parent, wants them to be there. Peer pressure is a stronger force than faith, for most people.Like the one believer in the classroom, our son had the same experience in his first college biology class last year. He finished with a 98 average in the class without compromising his faith. On test questions that contradicted his faith, he would give two answers. The first answer would be prefaced with \"This is the answer you are expecting\". The second answer would begin with \"This is what I believe\".Overall, I would rec this movie.",

People who are intelligent will continue to produce films like this. As far as the body of the film itself, great acting, great directing, overall excellent film. Do yourself, and your family a favor and go see the film. One more small point, this is the only film I have ever seen on IMDb where all the negative reviews are on page 1 or 2. Most of the time you have to go to the back to see the negative reviews, but on this film, every review on page 1 or 2 is one star, \"horrible film\" or some other ad hominem attack.

I've been having what some call a crisis of faith for several years now, and I think I finally figured out that maybe the problem wasn't that I was trying to rediscover my faith, but perhaps it was that I was trying to find out why I quit believing in God. More and more, I've been drawn to an Atheist view, and was hoping that maybe this movie would help me firm up my stance on Atheism.I went into the experience knowing that it was likely to be tilted in the other direction, but was curious what arguments would be made. In that respect, I think the movie did an excellent job of laying out the usual arguments (for and against the existence of God). It also wove together a good story about how we are all inter-connected as people. Ultimately, I think this movie gives any viewer the information they need to make up their own mind about the question.It really is about choice, and what we choose to believe. We either accept that there is a God, or we believe that there is not a God. My own personal experience was that I went into this movie expecting to have help proving that God did not exist. I came out of the movie believing that God does exist. The arguments made in the movie helped me clarify why I have spent fifty years moving in the direction on non-belief, and why it is okay to accept that every person makes their own choice.

            "content": "Let me start out saying that I am a Christian living in the Bible Belt, but even I and my family found this movie to be wrong in so many ways.First let me point out how unrealistic the population is. The main character first is seen in a class where the professor is attempting to get all of his students to reject the existence of God. We all know that any action like this would have a major outcry and he would be out on his ear immediately, but I digress. Anyway, the main character not only seems to be the only one that is willing to stand up against this, but also is shown later to have no support and is shunned by his girlfriend, her parents, and his parents for his faith...seeing as Christianity is the number one religion in the world, I cannot see this being plausible. Also, I can see that the refusal of God would also be offensive to Muslims,Jewish people, and others as well, as Christianity is not the only religion with a God. Then we have the negative stereotypes of the Atheists and those of other religions and nationalities. It shows them all to be abusive towards others (verbally, emotionally, and physically), angry, haters of God, unwilling to listen or accept the views of others, and wishing to covert others to Atheism. This is very not true and I find this very offensive and hateful. The points that were made in defense of Christianity were started in the right way but were poorly explained and executed. Science should definitely be considered with faith, as they often go hand in hand, faith should always be based on good logic. Morals cannot be based on a book or on God, everyone is taught right and wrong regardless of their faith or lack thereof, so this is a moot point and very insulting. Quotes from famous people are good in making a point but are not facts and should not be used in making a solid argument. I believe in God and even these points would not make me believe. Also, the pastor in the end attempting to convert the professor as he was dying was just plain wrong, forcing him to make a decision in a time when he is too vulnerable and hurt to make a rational decision is awful and probably not very true of his real feelings. The attitude of the pastor after the man's death is horrid and makes me angry, as he and his friend seem to celebrate that at least the professor is in heaven and that the pastor did a good job in converting him before death rather than feeling sorrow for the loss of this man's life. It makes it feel like this man's soul is no more than a number and the very thought makes me want to cry. There are so many other things here that are so wrong, but I only have so many words. I was raised Christian and became an Agnostic for a time, trying to find what I really believed and not just what was crammed down my throat. If someone showed me this during that time, I would have run from Christianity as fast as I could. If this was meant to make others want to turn to Christianity it failed not only by isolating those of other faiths and beliefs but also by giving the impression that all Christians think this way. Please, if more Christian movies are to be made, understand that Christianity is not under attack from other faiths or Atheists. And if your goal is to educate, actually teach, not browbeat and scream at others about how they are wrong with poorly planned and explained points.",

            "content": "\"God's Not Dead.\" There really aren't many words to adequately describe it and, at this point, it's been pretty accurately and fairly scrutinized in dozens of YouTube videos. In terms of faith-based movies sourced from songs, God's Not Dead ranks near the absolute bottom of the tier listing. Now, movies based off songs aren't inherently bad (the same can also be said for religious movies; they aren't all inherently bad), but the way in which this movie portrays literally everything from the first frame to the last is done entirely wrong at every step of the way.Directed by the remarkably underwhelming Harold Cronk and released through religious propaganda machine/Netflix competitor PureFlix, God's Not Dead tells the story of a group of people who bravely and selflessly stand up for their faith. The... pleasure begins with a young man who refuses to write the words \"God is Dead\" on a piece of paper in a class, thus engaging in a long-standing debate to try to convince the professor that God does, in fact, still exist and is not dead. If it sounds redundant, that's because it is. The movie is as lacking in proper plot points and compleling story that it could effectively be used to replace insomnia medications. The acting is wooden at best, the music (even from the \"big\" band, Newsboys, who recorded the title track) is mediocre, and the entire film is a long piece of Christian propaganda. It's disingenuous to the core with massive overreactions to the smallest character developments. Then again, from a Christain production, are we really surprised? The more they create, the more apparent it becomes that they don't know how anyone outside their tight-knit religious communities live their lives.The character of the atheist is clearly the villain, further driving the message that anyone who disagrees with or challenges the Christian worldview is automatically evil and cannot be trusted. Allegedly, at Newsboys concerts, scenes from the film would routinely be played and the audience would boo loudly at the atheist character, which is always a good way to influence skeptics into your religion. It's clearly a Christian actor trying his hardest to be an edgy, hardcore atheist but it falls as flat as everything else. The portrayal is unrealistic as the overwhelming majority of atheists couldn't possibly be any less concerned with Christians. And yet this film, instead of just being a fluffy piece of propaganda, has to go so far as to completley villify any opposition.This film presents a one-sided worldview, tainted entirely by Christian glasses. Everyone who doesn't fit their narraitve is automatically painted as the \"bad guy,\" from the atheist character to the upset parents who apparently can't handle their children's wishes to switch to Christianity. As we've seen countless times in Christian movies, the victim card is played in this one, too, but it's turned up to the highest level. This film, to the faithful, shows the threats against Christianity as a society and, through blatant untruths and harmful stereotypes, seeks to villify anyone who would dare to disagree. The movie ends with a message that is both bleak and desperate: a call to all Christians to text \"God's Not Dead\" to everyone in their phone contact list... as if that's ever going to convert anyone.If anything, it gives the religiously unaffiliated a chance to laugh at the fact that you not only went to see this film and funded these propaganda pieces created by people who are NOT filmmakers, but that you were so moved by having your one-dimensional worldview catered to for an hour and a half that you actually fell for the texting trap.Christians, you are capable of making decent movies. But you choose preachers to become filmmakers, and the end results are always awful. They make you guys look bad and, although your worldview may be as one-dimensional as an early Walt Disney animated short, it's just not the reality of the world. This film furthers the divide between Christians and the rest of the world. But, after suffering through it again and looking closely at the plot, that appears to be the overarching purpose.Colossal waste of time. Please just watch something else.

This is the kind of film which should appeal to the \"Atheists are all evil and are trying to destroy Christianity\" group of Christians and Evangelists out there. I also found most of the characters underdeveloped and bland. They generally fell into two categories: (1) Atheist who's a jerk to all Christians they come across and (2) Christian who's persecuted for their religion. The individual arcs for most of these characters were uninteresting and predictable and since so much time was devoted to exploring those characterizations, this made most of the film really dull to sit through. Amy is the only character who (kind of) stood out in the entire film due to one decent scene she had near the end. With that being said, I wouldn't say the film is a complete waste of time. In terms of the quality of the filmmaking, it's actually fairly good. Some of the Christian rock in the film (especially in the final act) sounded really good (I'm not referring to the overbearing sentimental score which played throughout a decent chunk of the film, btw), the acting was decent across the board (Kevin Sorbo gave a solid performance as Professor Radisson), and I suppose the cinematography looked good.

Either way it is tragic that Americans can no longer converse with each other on any subject.

            "content": "I actually found the movie quite engaging. I often tend to get bored while watching movies but this wasn't one of them. Everything was so exaggerated and unrealistic that it cracked me up. Some atheists might get offended seeing how the atheist Professor was depicted but I didn't take it too seriously. I was amused by his arrogance while at the same time knowing that if I ever had to debate a Christian I could provide better arguments. And both of the relationship break ups were as hilarious as they were unrealistic.However, having the Professor killed at the end was completely uncalled for. I would have nothing against him just walking out of the lecture hall frustrated that he lost the argument, but really having him convert just out of sheer fear of death? It's just pathetic script writing. Same with the reporter woman. The fact she flipped out and converted because of the cancer was equally lame. Please Christian movie producers, threatening people with death to have them convert is NOT a good idea!!!! It discourages people from joining your religion!!!!Finally, what sane person thought the whole Muslim thing was a good idea?? Who actually came into the studio and said \"Let's create a plot line completely unrelated to the main story, and in it let's have a Muslim father beat his daughter. People are going to love it.\" I don't think the depiction of actions of extremist Muslims should be completely avoided in movies, just so as to not offend anyone, no. But either you make a much much darker movie focused on the lifestyle of extremist Muslims (like where people actually get stoned) or you completely stay away from the violence of Islams and depict moderate, westernized Muslims. The scene where the Muslim father gets angry is really just unneeded and cringeworthy.To sum up, the movie executes very well on its ideas. The pacing, soundtrack, acting and other technical aspects are actually not bad (though some people may not want to admit it). However, many of those ideas are plain bad and you won't enjoy it if you try to take it seriously. If you don't, well, it's possible to enjoy some decent comedy.",

It'd be like a film called \"Is Lebron James the Best Ever?\" written by and staring Lebron James. The acting and cinematography reminded me of an episode of One Tree Hill. Not bad, but not much to be desired. There are some incredibly offensive references to other religions. One thing That I can't wrap my head around is how you get from you can't prove there isn't a god to Jesus Christ must have died for your sins. It's poor logic. Let's stand on the only leg that we have with the god debate, so we don't have to get into the ridiculous Jesus debate. I wouldn't mention this if not for the blatant stab at the Muslim faith.

            "review_title": "God's Not Dead: A Propaganda FIlm",
            "content": "This is a movie with a lot of contradiction and parts of the film that could actually become their own movies if the makers of the film thought about it. It is not only about a college professor, but it is mostly about the struggles of those who believe. If they renamed the film \"The Struggles of Believers\", than maybe this film would feel less misleading, and much more true to the actual plot. The film's central plot seems to revolve around Josh Wheaton, a college student in a philosophy course that is taught by a militant, ruthless Atheist, Professor Radisson, played by Kevin Sorbo. Radisson begins his first class by telling students that God does not exist, and for 30% of their grade, to write on a piece of paper \"God is Dead\" with their signature. The characters mindlessly accept this, but Christian character Wheaton accepts the challenge of debating Professor Radisson on the existence of God. I'm sorry, but what actual college professor does that? I thought philosophy was about critical and objective thinking, not about mindlessly accepting an idea laid out by a professor. I would have expected more students to stand against him and argue his ideas. As an Atheist, I'm already upset by the fact that Atheists are openly portrayed in this movie as rude and inconsiderate, but people of other religions are portrayed as rude an inconsiderate as well. As will be explored, there is a Muslim father who abuses his daughter for being Christian. The Atheist woman named Amy, who is diagnosed with Cancer, is dumped by her abusive boyfriend and is portrayed as selfish and as a person who makes rude comments to anyone who is Christian. Also, the Anti-Muslim moments are ridiculous and completely offensive. The Muslim college student gets kicked out of her house by her father for being secretly Christian, trying to make them look bad. That was entirely uncalled for and has absolutely nothing to do with the central plot, and only seems to be in the film for the sole purpose of making Christians look like the \"good guys\" and the Muslims look \"evil\". I mean, the way her father kicks her out of her house\u0085he first slaps her onto her bed and then drags her out of her bed, than practically chokes the girl, all for being of a different faith than he. How can anyone not view that as offensive? It has absolutely nothing to do with a boy trying to have a debate with a professor about the existence of God. Radisson finds himself beside himself in renewed grief, sifting through the \"God is Dead\" signatures when he opens up a desk and finds a rather harrowing letter written by his mother to him before he died, essentially stating that she's really upset by the fact that she'd never get to see him grow up, but she knew that God had better plans for him. Sorbo is inspired by this letter to get up and head to the Newsboys concert, and while he is walking there, a torrential rainfall pours and a thunderstorm ensues. En route to this concert, Radisson is hit by a car and dies within minutes of getting hit because of injuries. Before he dies, he gets saved by Pastor Dave, portrayed by David A.R. White, who comforts him about being afraid of death by telling him all about Jesus while he's dying. Where is the medical help? Try as they might to get it, the medical professionals around him can't seem to help the dying Professor. Right before Radisson dies, he gives his life over to God. Do the filmmakers and writers try to address his death in any sort of meaningful way? Do they tell the concert goers, \"Hey, your professor just died, but he turned himself over to God?\". The answer to that is no. They just decide to flat out kill the convert without any meaningful way of addressing his death. A funeral scene reflecting Radisson's death would have been nice, maybe even a mention of his conversion before death and a moment of prayer and silence for their recently fallen professor would have been nice. But do they do this? No, they party and jam out to a song called \"God's Not Dead\" like nothing has just occurred. Why was Radisson killed without meaningful mention of his death? It seems it is this way because he was an Atheist throughout the movie. However, it's suggest that he's only Atheist because he's upset with God for taking his mother's life in the most cruel of ways. After watching this film, I've concluded that there's no way to walk away from it without some sort of bias, one way or the other. You will either find it offensive and horrible, or you will find it a great film. There's no way to be ambivalent about it, at least in my eyes. This movie serves as a propaganda film against Atheists, mainly for the movie's portrayal of Atheists and also for the terrible things that occur to them, even as they convert to Christianity. There is a bit of filler in this film\u2014we do get guest appearances by Willie Robertson and his wife of Duck Dynasty, a show that has gained major controversy over the family praying to God in every episode, we do meet characters that seem to help the plot advance slightly, but then there are situations that seem to have nothing to do with the plot that centers around the professor and the college student. The subplots of the movie stand out because they have nothing to do with the original story. As I said, \"The Struggles of Believers\" would have been a much more fitting title for this film.Final Rating: 2/10, would not watch again.",

It's a Christian made movie. What do you expect. The antagonists in the movie portrayed stereotypical anti-Christians. I have met people like all of these. Just like the average Hollywood movie portrays Christians and idiots, likewise is true and false. There are no doubt some Christians that are idiots, but a lot of them are not. Most Hollywood movies are propaganda for some -ism, albeit hedonism. It is no shocker that this movie which is anti-hedonistic, and pro-Christian would upset some.The answer to #2 is that in any film, you have to make generalizations. No one could make a film about exact scenarios that covered everyone. Most films, that are based in some form of reality, that are not Biographies or specific documentaries, are in some form, stereotypical. You can't expect anything different. The film portrayed the stereotypes, I believed, well. Not perfect, but well. Obviously there are a lot of people in these scenarios that are not covered.

But some of the reviews claiming horrendous acting are being a bit exaggerated and even downright hateful.Was there some cheesiness? Yeah, a little.

I enjoy a great action film, horror movie or thriller / drama just like anyone else. Memento, Die Hard, Zombieland, Dr. Strangelove are just a few of my favorite movies. I've seen plenty of 'religious' films too - some are really good, and admittedly - some are quite poor; at least when it comes to direction, script and/ or acting. This movie ranks with the good ones. Yes, there are parts that feel a bit forced - like the interaction between Josh and his Professor towards the end of the movie, and I wish they had given more meat to Kevin Sorbo's character (though I think he did great with what he was given), but it's easy to overlook some heavy handedness when considering the movie as a whole.Other reviewers have mentioned that the movie vilified the Muslim father, but I don't see that to be the case. I actually felt great sympathy for their family - while I don't agree with the Muslim faith, the actor portraying the Muslim girl's father was very good and believable. I wish they had spent a little more time on this part of the plot as well.The one thing that got dangerously close to taking me out of the movie was the overt promotion of the Newsboys in nearly half the scenes.

The movie is about whether on not God is real, not about Muslim's reaction to Christianity. The father, while brutal by our standards, was either fairly westernized, or a weak Muslim.

Not to me. Katrina, for personal reasons, cost me my faith. Yes, I was damned angry with God, all while I severely doubted his existence. So I identified with the professor's character. Likewise, the girlfriend. When my malignancy was diagnosed, I was angry and scared. After my second surgery, I determined to find out for myself if there was anything to this God business.

If you are not a Christian... again, watch the movie. It makes the truth very clear - This life will pass away for every single one of us eventually - and then what? If you think you just cease to exist - you better hope you are right, because if you're wrong, you will be wrong for the remainder of eternity and you will be doomed.",

            "content": "Admittedly, the only final conclusion of a discussion about the existence of god is that there is no clear answer - at best. Hence I was pretty interested to watch this movie as its description reminded me of the classic The Man from Earth (2007). Unfortunately the movie turned out to be a rather simple production.Overall it is hard to take much out of this movie. The characters at all times strongly exaggerate their respective positions which results in simple and partially ridiculous dialogues. Especially the end of the movie is hard to digest when a car, that was previously broken, suddenly works basically due to faith and when all characters that were previously described as god haters either die or are turned into believers. The movie may appeal to convinced believers but not to those who were looking for a serious discussion.",

It is biased as movies typically. There is just generally less tolerance when Christ followers profess their faith. Overall good movie with a message . I have read reviews about the non Christian characters in the movie as being portrayed poorly. I did not see it that way at all. To me it it portrayed the Muslim father as a loving caring father putting out tough love to his daughter. The professor was also treated fairly as a non believer. The script Seemed well written and thought provoking.",

            "content": "I see that there are lots of divergent reviews on this film. Some folks think the film is wretched others love it. I am definitely in between. The film has strengths and weaknesses--but regardless what you think about it, it DOES fit a niche--and that is why it is a great financial success. There is a significant portion of people who rarely go to the theaters and who often feel that the films playing in theaters are far from family-friendly. So, even if some other folks dislike the films, for many Christian viewers they are a wonderful opportunity to come back to the theaters--and this is a positive thing. Likewise, if niche films brought Muslims or Agnostics to the theaters, so be it--if there is a demand, then let the films play. And, don't attend if you don't want to. As for me, it's not the sort of film I'd pay to see but I took my mother-in-law and she adored it (aside from the Christian rock music at the end--which I actually liked).So why do I give the film a 6? Well, it's a nice story for believers-- and will make many of them quite happy. On the other hand, I cannot ignore that the film has several deficits--such as some overly simplistic story elements (especially the ending involving the car accident) as well as too many characters and subplots. The problem with the subplots and characters is that several would have been great in a movie all by themselves--such as the girl from the traditional Muslim family or the woman dying of cancer. Instead, the movie 'shotgunned'-- throwing EVERYTHING into the film but the kitchen sink.So, for folks who aren't Christians looking for a film to confirm their beliefs, it's a film to skip. But, for someone wanting a religious film with reasonably good production values and good acting, it's worth seeing.",

Best of all was the musical score by the Christian group \"Newsboys\" at the end. Liberals would deny there is a war on Christianity in the USA, Christians seem to be easy targets for bullying nonetheless. This movie is a message movie, that to me would be standing up for your faith and what you believe, no matter what secular mainstream society tells you otherwise. Very uplifting.",

            "review_title": "A tad better than the usual evangelical fare, but still fundamentally flawed",
            "content": "I'm always curious to see the latest effort of this kind, when evangelicals put together a pile a cash and try to craft a high- production-values flick with a spiritual message. They always seem to miss the target--and for fairly obvious reasons--but there's a part of me, deep inside, that wants to see them succeed, and blow the heathens' minds.So, here I am again!In this regard, God's Not Dead (GND) starts out quite promising, but (IMHO) Peters out.You can see that, at least initially, some serious thinking went into the goal of trying to \"keep\" the dialog/character development/scenarios \"real\"; so there's a (holy) ghost of a chance of hooking the doubters. It starts to really look like they're not just preaching to the choir. And that's admirable. But then the fundie fantasy starts leaking in, at first in a thin dribble, but finally flooding the sundry scenarios in a torrent.I'm suddenly sort of wondering whether what we're seeing, as the movie begins its decline into full-tilt fundie froth mode, is a bad case of \"producer cold-feet syndrome\". This is what I call it when producers start off with the best intentions of creating something edgy, subtle, and artistic, but in the end cop out to the assumption that recouping outlays necessitates kowtowing to an unsubtle common denominator. In the case of GND, this would mean that the producers started out with a plan to go all out and tip over the fundie bell jar, but then chickened out toward the end of production and decided that crafting a message that would truly speak to the non-elect would necessarily alienate the \"megachurch demographic\"--and subsequently fail to recoup expenses.So the beginning of the movie is surprisingly resonant, tho with a few false notes, e.g., the prof requiring students to sign a statement declaring that \"God is Dead\"?!!? C'mon...! The sequences with the two pastor buddies and their errant car are stunningly well- written/directed/acted, and stand a chance of affording non-churched types a window into a gracious and sacred lifestyle. The girlfriend's strident demands that her Christian boyfriend leave off his plan to present his faith to philosophy class may seem a tad forced, but some of their dialog does ring of genuine spiritual, truth-seeking probity.But then the cavalcade of affronteries against the elect commence, and what a litany it is! The unchurched get entirely left to rot as the churched types beat their breasts over the manifold indignities of life on a heathen planet.Seeing how this flick winds up as yet-another in a long line of bad- faith exercises in communicating (evangelical) faith, what can I point to as a counter-example? Strangely, I think the best examples can be found in early Fellini. Fellini grew up in a deeply Catholic Italy, and it shows: He was a fine film moralist, whose messages often function as sermons on specific teachings from the Bible, e.g., \"La Dolce Vita\" --> \"There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof is death.\"The message is clear: You want to communicate your faith in film? The row is a tough one to hoe, but it basically comes down to this: Know your own mind; Seek the truth; Sit down to write your script with nothing but brutal, faith-guided honestly as your dictum; remember the primacy of artful narrative (you're making a movie, NOT penning a sermon); unstintingly go where the spirit truly leads you.You can't lose.I give this film a '6' for the occasional flashes of surprising spiritual trenchancy, some of the amazing acting moxie--even if some of that moxie is spent on less-than-enlightened scenario work--and some of the general production work.",

Not everything we go though is caused by God but that if God allows us to go through it he will see us through it. I am reminded by what happened to the professor -spoiler- with Not a Fan where Eric died from a heart attack where his brother asked if God is so good and Eric is so good why did God let this happen? His reply was maybe God and Eric was not as good as people think. God is good and Eric became good and that was when he was attacked because he became good.

I'm gonna give it a 2/10 instead of a 1/10 because the screenplay isn't bad, the actors do what they can and the theme song is pretty catchy, I like it. Also, even though it wasn't intended, the movie is an OK satire. But that's the thing, it isn't meant to be a comedy... Everybody except ignorant fundamentalist American Christians agree this movie is bad so I won't write too much about it, I'll just say that the depiction of every non-Christian character is intentionally distorted and misrepresents reality, portraying non-Christians as unethical people. This movie not only misrepresents groups of people but it also misrepresents the present situation in the United States and in the world. No, atheist aren't taking over the planet, the big majority of the world population is religious (78%). Last but not least, the arguments and premises used when the student and the teacher debate are very poor, inaccurate, and misrepresent the real arguments for both sides of the debate, specially on the atheist side, but that's to be expected given that in the end we find out that the \"atheist\" wasn't really an atheist after all. With all that said, I recommend this movie because it's so bad and so obviously propaganda that you can't miss it, like I said in the title, if somebody had told me this was a parody, I'd have believed it. CONLCUSION (spoiler-free): This movie is American Christian propaganda, it misrepresents non-Christians and their views and it misrepresents the contemporary situation regarding the popularity of Christianity in the US. If you are an atheist or an open minded, tolerant religious person I highly recommend you to watch this film because it's so bad it will make you laugh. 2/10 nice song, very bad movie.

So if they don't believe in God, why is it so important to them to make sure others don't believe in God. It's really a senseless position to hold. This movie illustrates that very issue quite clearly. Sooner or later every atheist comes to the realization that they've been wrong all their miserable life.

Do you hate God so much that the mere utter of his Holy name or his title of the Lord of the Heavens sends you off the deep end? Ever wonder who you are actually serving when you think this way? Oh sure most of you don't believe in Satan, but he believes in you. But on the good side of this argument, so does the Lord of all things, my God. He believes in you and wants you to take your place in his Kingdom, by his side. Just like what this movie was trying to tell you. I actually believe that more that half the negative reviews come from people that hate God and Jesus, and honestly probably never even watched this movie. This movie is a wonderful and great film that needs to be seen by EVERYONE ! Atheist, Satanist, evolutionists, are all one in the same, but at least the Satanist are one step ahead of the other two, because they actually KNOW that GOD is real...

I have friends like him who because God did not answer their prayers for a terminally ill loved one, have turned against their Creator and, yes, even hate God. So it is not at all far fetched that this professor could have the same reaction to the death and loss of his mother to cancer when he was a young boy. The fact that the young uni student took a great risk in deciding to defend his faith because he felt convicted that God was leading him to do this made one consider the depth of their own commitment. He could so easily have ditched the class or complied with the instructor's request. But like Daniel of old when he faced the Lions Den for worshiping and praying to his God openly, as was his custom, so this young man took the risk to his academic future. Despite family and friends urging him to take the easy way out, he stood firm for his faith with heartening results. Cheesy?

Regardless of what Kevin may think on his Twitter and Facebook, Christianity is not under attack and that's not why he's not popular in Hollywood, he's just a very angry man.

            "content": "God's Not Dead - Review Year: 2014 Director: Harold CronckGod's Not Dead its a film that had sold me in advance the idea of a young man and a professor in a debate for God's existence. Precisely, the difficulty of doing this is what piqued my curiosity about how the plot would unfold. What I got is not exactly what I was expecting,the way the young student argues his point sounds a bit absurd, however, how would you argue God's existence?, really hard, but mainly it disappoints me the fact that the professor doesn't argue with atheism but hate to the faith and it's perceived more like an eradicator of the belief. Josh's ex girlfriend attitude planning all aspects of their lives is a bit excessive. Although some people agree that atheists in the film were put as few people values, I think simply they specified in radical attitudes. Finally some scenes were a bit random, like the Muslim's daughter and a too cheerful end in the absurd final concert. A film that for a moment made me reflect on the existence of a divine being who created everything but mixed with riotous scenes losing the sense of the plot. Personally, at the end of the sessions I would have raised to support Josh, not because he had convinced me, but because he really won the argument against the hatred and fury of Professor Radisson.From a broader perspective, we can say that I'm an atheist, and I can understand that in some way for the believers, all that call probability or random or fate, they call it God, and there is a chance that at the end scientists and believers are seeking the same answer, God as the origin of everything and the explanation to everything.In conclusion, it's an entertaining film that tries to give a massage that stays on the road.",

Some of the more complex arguments, such as scenes where Josh pointed out flaws in the reasoning of some famous scientists, were clever and easy to understand.I did feel that the resolution of some major character story lines became trivialised when more time was given to a rock group performance than a dying person. Professor Radisson's departure was far too simplistic. However, I wonder if the makers of the film intended it to be a much more simpler story than the stronger film it turned out to be.

The story line is important to the movie, well it is the movie; but just not enough for some expecting a real \"lift me up\". Josh Wheaton(Shane Harper)is a college student in the process of majoring in Law; he is required to take a philosophy class and it will challenge his morals and belief in God. Professor Radisson(Kevin Sorbo)is an atheist that insists his students sign a paper admitting that God is dead in order to pass the class. Josh balks and is challenged by Radisson to debate him and convince the members of the class that God is not dead! The arguments at first are pretty convincing that God is alive, but Radisson has his own agenda and proves to be very narrow minded and is so sure of himself that he doubts Wheaton can change his classmate's minds about the paper they signed.The acting is a bit lacking and pedestrian.

            "review_title": "Part Christian Propaganda, Part Newsboys Commercial",
            "content": "The biggest trap one can fall into when reviewing a film like God's Not Dead is immediately taking the \"I'm reviewing the film, not the message\" approach. God's Not Dead is a message movie, so reviewing it with examining the actual message is like reviewing Transformers without talking about giant fighting robots. And since many positive reviews of the film invariably defend it by claiming that negative reviewers are merely reactionary Atheists angry that the film has disproved them (if you think I'm kidding, just scroll through the IMDb reviews for a minute or two), avoiding the religious debate that anchors the film is little more than an exercise in futility.God's Not Dead falls firmly in the category of Christian Propaganda film; not because it promotes God and Christianity, but because it does so the way that all propaganda films do: by creating a straw man argument supported by characters and situations specifically designed to defeat the alternate viewpoint at odds with the message. This is not an attack on the film's message, but rather a critical appraisal of the mechanics of the film's argument, which isn't so much that God is very much alive, but that those who believe in God - or more precisely, a Christian God - face constant persecution and challenges to their faith by snotty, angry, and downright abusive Atheists.The main Atheist and straw man of the film is college philosophy Professor Radisson, played by Kevin Sorbo, whose career ironically peaked with his portrayal of Greek demigod Hercules. Professor Radisson is the film's main antagonist, who sets everything into motion by asking his class to admit that God is Dead so they can skip theological discussions for the semester. When devout Christian and avid Newsboys fan Josh refuses, he's threatened with a failing grade unless he concedes to the demand or proves God's existence.This main premise of the film, meant to embody the mythical bogeyman of the anti-Christian left-wing collegiate intelligentsia, is in and of itself completely ludicrous. The idea that a Philosophy professor would threaten to fail a student for not denying his own religious faith, and be notorious enough for doing so that class registrars are motivated to warn crucifix-laden students to switch classes, already stretches the limits of willful disbelief. That a philosophy professor would then demand a student unequivocally prove anything, let alone the existence of God, demonstrates an overall lack of understanding of philosophy. Radisson's thinly-veiled hostility towards Josh's faith becomes open hostility when he later physically confronts Josh and threatens to prevent him from ever getting a law degree (um... okay...) if he keeps trying to embarrass him in front of his students, an act that would most likely impact one's teaching career, God or no God.Granted, the argument could be made that Radisson is not meant to represent all philosophy professors, just a bad one. If that were the case, however, there would be no need to include the dinner party scene at Radisson's home in which a collection of fellow philosophy professors not only support his Prove God or Fail challenge to his student, but also join him in openly ridiculing his young Christian girlfriend for being Christian and storing wine in her trunk. But there is, and the purpose of this is to show that we are not just dealing with one twisted professor, but a vast conspiracy of institutionalized anti-Christian aggression.But intellectual snobbery isn't enough for the film, which needs to invoke a monumental David and Goliath battle between the faithful and those angry Atheists, so Josh is also pitted against his girlfriend of six years, who demands that he capitulate to Radisson's demands because flunking a humanities elective will jeopardize his future law degree and their entire future together. When he ignores her ultimatum and takes on the task of proving God's existence to a Freshman philosophy class, she immediately breaks up with him - and right after he got her tickets to see the Newsboys for an anniversary gift. This is probably the most realistic part of the film, as I can easily recall the number of girlfriends I've lost because I wouldn't deny the existence of a supreme being in exchange for course credits. We never meet Josh's parents, but he does mention briefly in a couple of asides that they want him to deny God as well. So much for parental guidance.These are the only direct foils to Josh's faith, but the film gives us some pseudo-Atheist side stories in poor man's Magnolia fashion to illustrate it's point. Not that they really do, mind you. In fact, the parallel story lines intertwined with the God's Not Dead argument don't support the existence of God as much as the belief that people who don't believe are hostile, empty shells. Indirectly related to Radisson is his girlfriend's brother Mark, who isn't an Atheist as much as he is a sociopathic douche bag. He's supposed to stand in as an example of the evils of corporate greed (no arguments there), refusing to visit his dementia-ridden mother, engaging in insider trading, and dumping his girlfriend when she ruins his company partnership celebration by telling him she's been diagnosed with cancer. He's given a glimpse of redemption when a late-night visit to his mother includes her warning him of the devil's trickery in a lucid moment right out of Exorcist 3, but in the end he discard's God's message and speeds off in his BMW. Not sure what the character of Mark lends to the argument for God's existence, other than that most nonbelievers are colossal dicks.You can read the rest of this review (IMDB only allows 1,000 words) by going to http://moviesucktastic.blogspot.com/2016/04/film-review- gods-not-dead-2014.html",

Though the professor's portrayal may seem over the top quite a bit, nonetheless he does represent an accurate metaphor for the attitude of much of academia and the sciences towards believers.The story nicely pits \"authority\" against sound logic and the bold confrontation of faulty reasoning. The student that decides to take on his \"out of line\" prof and present his case for God's existence is allowed 3 class periods to do so. A few other students are very interested in how this will go down and the prof tries many ways to bully his way out of the situation finds himself in. Meanwhile, the student's girlfriend confronts him about jeopardizing their plans for a future together by going thru with it.The prof's girlfriend is getting tired of his selfish episodes and jabs at her faith in God. Meanwhile a girl from a strict Muslim family is worried about he father learning about her Christian faith. At the same time a pastor and a visiting pastor friend are finding obstacles to their plans. And so it is that an invisible hand is also at work...It all makes for plenty of drama and good acting, with well developed characters. Even the opening scene itself is outstanding in the way it sets the stage for everything else! Good movie and great lessons!",

It was the one small detail that was ignored: a Muslim woman who covers her face would likely cover her upper arms and her forearms too.The carelessness with which Muslims and atheists were portrayed in this movie reflects the producer's lack of concern for accuracy or fairness.

Men, I think, will be especially offended by this movie.The debate between the young college student and the seasoned professor went pretty well, until we find WHY the professor believes what he does--then what started out as a intelligent debate lost any of its merit, on both sides. That the professor also turns out to be a jerk in his personal life detracts from his validation as well.The student, the lead actor, is played quite well and has a decent character development, however everyone else is painted with a pretty broad caricature brush. SPOILER!!--You know, right from the outset, just by looking at his over-the-top appearance, that the Muslim dad is a villain. I will give the film credit for showing that he genuinely grieves over his loss, however, it is a HORRIBLE depiction, and only reinforces the stereotypes that pervade our society.While I'm sure there are people out there who fit these stereotypes, for all of them to be crammed into one film and one man's life is just too much. What could be a decent presentation of a debate about the existence of God is tarnished by all the distractions of evil God-haters vs. sympathetic, tortured \"beleivers.\"",

However, I want to give my personal opinion on the film without taking any sides. This is probably one of the most mixed reviews I've done on a film, since there are two different opinions I both agree with.\nPeople say this movie is preachy, poorly acted, and it's religious propaganda, and others say that it's an inspiring movie with great messages.\nNow, I understand both sides on the film-I mean, let me put this way. The film takes an honest approach at its material-and certainly makes an attempt to share its message. I love when films use this concept because this concept lets me know right off the bat that they're trying to make an honest film which handles questions of God's existence.\nI admit, the film is very honest in terms of its subject matter. It certainly makes a good attempt at creating an honest approach to the subject matter, and for this, I do applaud this concept used in God's Not Dead.\nAlso, some of the performances are pretty good as well. Harper gives an effective portrayal of his character by using dialogue to offer a look at his beliefs, and his acting is effective in creating a likable character that the audience may find themselves rooting for.\nSorbo gives a fine performance as well, sometimes delivering his dialogue in great ways, and sometimes delivering an unrealistic performance in terms of reactions and deliveries. Overall, Sorbo does fine in God's Not Dead.\nHowever, where the film ultimately fails is at its preachy aspect. Now, just because it can be preachy, doesn't mean it's a terrible film. The film still needs some work in its approach to handling the subject matter. The film seems to be forcing the audience to side with their opinion, and as a result, doesn't work in terms of bringing the message home.\nUsing certain concepts, the film is forceful in its methods of sharing the message. Using certain scenes to do so, the film seems to be attempting to force the viewer to believe its opinion, which comes off as preachy.\nA film shouldn't be attempting to make its audience think a certain way or believe a certain way. But, however, God's Not Dead does this when it tries to force its audience to think a certain way.\nAfter all, God's Not Dead is a fine film to watch, but is still too preachy when it comes to sharing its message. However, the performances do shine and I appreciate the film's honest approach to covering its material.",

And not just Theism, but one of the relatively small set of faiths within the grouping of *Abrahamic* Theism. And not just Abrahamic Theism, but American-style Christianity.In the world of this film, Islam is a dark stereotype on the edges of reality, Judaism and Mormonism and Hinduism are nonexistent, and really neither is Agnosticism to be seen, even. Christians and Atheists are equally just so beguilingly *certain* in their knowledge of the unknowable. And yet the God debated isn't really the Christian God, since the arguments used in favor of their being a God at all are more suitable to supporting a God of Deism (if not Pandeism).There is room in higher levels of discourse for films examining the fertile grounds of Agnosticism, Pandeism, even avenues of Polytheism.

If this was supposed to be a Christian propaganda thing then why cover it up with a misleading title and a tag line? I was expecting a movie and story line that would restore faith in the concept of God ( then it wouldn't matter if you are a Christian or a Muslim or a Hindu or simply a person who believes in God without believing in religion). Why is it so difficult for these people to understand men and women who believe in the concept of a higher power without belonging to a religion? It would make sense if the title was something on the lines of 'Jesus is not dead' or 'The Christian god is not dead and he is the one true god'. Anything else other than the vague title they gave. And a tag line that says 'for Christians'.",

Then I would come on here and see the scathing reviews, many from Christians, as stated in their reviews.Overall, I found the movie satisfying. It gave me a renewed sense of faith and put a big goofy grin on my face when (spoiler) most of the principle characters accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. However, the film does have some flaws. Many of the characters are stereotypical. The atheist professor, of course, treats anyone with religious beliefs, especially Christians, like absolute morons. The Muslim father is portrayed as abusive in the scene where he finds out about her Christian faith. A Chinese foreign exchange student is forbidden by his father to talk about God. While there are a few more, these are the main stereotypes. While there are a few people in the world who are like that, it would have made the movie better if they had portrayed more of the general population. Also, I enjoyed the movie mostly because only the Christian argument was fully elaborated on. It might have made the film more marketable and enjoyable to other audiences if the Atheist argument was elaborated further, and it could have provided a better argument for God to non-Christians in the theaters.Mostly, I would call this movie an extreme situation for Christians entering into college and adult life. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that believers will face this type of interrogation, for lack of a better word. If you are a non-Christian, you might find the movie either pointless or offensive. For Christians, I believe that it is a heart-warming movie.",

            "content": "God's Not Dead delves deeper into the complex reality of life for people in this postmodern world than its predecessors in the evangelical Protestant big-screen efforts. God's Not Dead definitely represents a step up in quality over films such as Facing the Giants, Fireproof, and Courageous. A higher budget brought an overall improvement in the cinema experience for the viewer. That and stronger acting and sharper editing drove along this evangelical Protestant film's most obvious upgrade to this reviewer: the genuine development of more characters.Could that have been even stronger? Yes. Could it have been a bit more balanced? Yes. But I applaud the makers of God's Not Dead for exploring real human complexities, and that's a river most evangelical Protestants are reluctant if not downright unwilling to swim. In God's Not Dead, for example, we see a university coed raised Muslim converting to Christianity, and, while her father is violent in his reaction to learning of his daughter's conversion, both before that scene and at the end of that scene, we see a human dad sincerely striving to raise his children as best he can and his genuine disappointment over his daughter's loss of the faith of her upbringing. What Christian cannot have empathy with this father, despite a difference in beliefs? Another example is the sudden disappearance from the movie of a female character that played an important supporting role in the first half of the film. The reason for the disappearance demonstrates that while immersing teens in church youth group activities can be very beneficial in faith development, genuine and abiding faith is shaped through real-time life experiences. In other words, for this female character, her Christianity was as external as her overly thick makeup.And many of the other characters were not left at the superficial level, we actually found out what made them tick, what drove them to be the way they are.The classroom discussions over the existence of God can spur viewers, no matter their beliefs, to investigate for themselves and perhaps be less afraid of opposing viewpoints.All that said, the movie's makers couldn't help themselves in forcing piecing of the puzzle by going to the evangelical Protestant \"Come to Jesus\" solution in unrealistic settings that stretch the imagination. That they left a few developed characters \"unsaved\" contributes to a more -- notice I said more -- realistic feel about this flick than about many others in this genre.For the genuine effort made in developing characters and presenting a more realistic setting for people wrestling with the God question in their lives, I give God's Not Dead a passing grade of 7 and urge people to attend this movie.",

The \"point\" of this movie is to speak out to the world that God is not dead and to \"stand up\" for what you believe so yes it shows each type of persecution towards believers with the dad and the professor and so on but it isn't saying all unbelievers are that way, That was the point of the movie, to show specific things that are really going on today if you choose to stand and say I believe in Jesus Christ. Its a great story of courage and standing against the majority and there is no attacks or judgment towards unbelievers. Just like any other movie whether it's about racial attacks or homosexuality it will be highlighting this type of persecution. Why is it OK to make huge blockbusters full of murder, adultery, sex or sexual driven content and praise the makers and give it great reviews but if someone makes a movie that has anything to do with God, Not \"a\" God, but God the father of Jesus Christ or standing up for our beliefs in Christ it is torn to shreds and put down and belittled? Where is the freedom in that? What is wrong with this picture? Can society get any less moral or any more political or any freer than it is already? Free to do anything except proclaim Jesus Christ and the truth of his word because that sheds light on eternity and consequences for behavior and choices because we all have free will, but we want to live in our comforts and feel OK about what we choose to do. We all have a choice, free will like I said, so, why is living according to the word of God attacked with so much anger and judgment? If I stood for another God or political reasons I would get praised for that.

The \"educated\" answer most commonly embraced today (that this movie uses the professor character to portray) is the majority consensus of human conception and experience (call it science if you want, but that's what it is).

I gave it a comparatively high rating based on the first three quarters of the movie which is well done and appears objective.

We don't attack your beliefs, we just wish you guys would listen and perhaps understand why we're so critical. Instead of making us defend each other. Oh, and the whole Christian kids being persecuted scene bothers me especially. I've never heard of this happening to a Christian. What usually happens is that an atheist has to hide his parents, otherwise they'll be disowned. It's happened to me, it's happened to my friends, and is a huge conflict in atheist culture. Richard Dawkins even made a fund raiser to help these kids living on their own thanks to their parents disowning them. So, please don't praise this movie. It's one of those feel good movies that put other people down and is just plain rude and offensive. And for the last time, we do have morals. It's based on our own judgment and the fact that we don't go around killing people. We're enforced by the law and we have a much greater appreciation for life.

A complaint I keep hearing from, mainly non-Christians, is the plot sounds far-fetched.

One brave student refused to do it and was threatened with a bad grade. Thankfully, as word got out, the university apologized for the whole assignment.I can tell you I have met in my life people exactly like the characters in this film and although the interconnectedness of the principals is stretched, I believe that as a plot tool it works.

Sure, the movie biased because it's a Christian movie, it offends people because the creators of the movie believe 1 truth which isn't the common politically correct sense like most Hollywood progressive movies. The claims that were made in that classroom in the movie are very real and very serious. and beat any atheist argument i ever got to hear or contemplate.I would say what i thin about it as a Jewish person, but that wouldn't have anything to do with the movie. and so i leave it out. unlike many of you.Is the movie believable to most people? no, mainly due to the script. The situations described in the movie are very real, but they aren't subtle and do emphasize too much on god creating antagonism withing viewers. I had \"friendly\" bashings with my philosophy lecturer (devout atheist) a year ago who constantly tried to make me look a fool because I argued with him and asked him questions, he was almost every bit arrogant, confident and appealing to everyone as Kevin Sorbo (the professor) in that movie. by the way in that philosophy course i only learned that science can never and will never prove or disprove the existence of god. and any hopes of reaching any slithers of truth is abstract thought, which i find very limited.to be honest, as a student of cinema i can't possible give this movie a 1, it has good acting. good shooting, good sound. What really hurts it is the script that doesn't present it as believable to the mainstream.I don't believe people have a right not to be offended. people are constantly joyed by murder, rape, and other evil deeds on TV, but god forbid introduce the concept of god?! \"we're offended\". well that's the progressive political world of view that arrogantly thinks like the professor they know everything. about Islam? well it's completely true that a religious family would disown you. in the contrary - her father did that with pain because his beliefs come first. now imagine the outrage if she would have been killed by \"honor killings\" which exist and demean woman.Yes, the movie lacks in script, and it could tone down on quite a few things and we would still get the same great message (a bit too many overkills). but it's not a too of a bad movie and certainly not the world. we in the INTERNET would call it a \"meh\".",

I watched this movie knowing it was Christian, and not really caring what someone believes in if it helps them get through the misery of their daily lives, I watched it for the story's sake.It was typical of the David vs Goliath fable where a young man, poorly equipped, stands up against, a seemingly, mightier opponent.This type of myth structure has existed, more than likely, since before the people in Sumer began to write. In the end the hero wins and the opponent is destroyed...which is exactly what happens here. Did the director tell the story in a way that was appealing ? I think so. I was on the side of the hero, I wanted him to slay the dragon-- Metaphorically.Where the movie fails is that it throws in stories that are meaningless. The Dean Cain role and his girlfriends cancer, the relationship between the professor and his girlfriend was simply devices to make atheists look bad...which is exactly what the atheist professor was trying to do to the Christian hero. Should I say hypocrite? nay, what's the point. Everyone finds ways to justify their own actions. Self-interest rules the day--always, regardless of the method of rationalization.The movie looks better than most religiously produced movies (outside of the Mormon movies of the late 1970's and early 1980...I think they were called their \"Home Front Series\", but they were produced with high quality, well directed and edited also). The problem with these films is that often someone is producing who demands screen time for themselves and family members (I thought that the duck dope and his blond wife were such, but I could be wrong. People like him is one of the reasons that Christianity has such a bad name.) Other low budget movies have been ruined by such people (Think of Plan 9 From Outer Space.I don't care to discuss religion with religionists (I will not call them Theologians either, since that suggests scholarship and let's face it most Christians--as we have found out--are dumb as dirt about their own religion outside of some bashing verses from the Bible), but I really do not give any credence to militant atheists. It is popular to be an atheist and I am beginning to see that some of the stupidest people I have ever met are part of their crowd now. Anyone who is militant about their beliefs suffers from anti social behavior disorders and should be shunned by society...regardless of what they believe.",

            "content": "Gods Not Dead is awful. I originally watched it back in April or May of 2014, when I was only 10. I was still religious back then, so I decided to watch this movie. What I remember from that day was pretty blurred, so I re-watched it earlier today, and oh my god (So to speak) this \"Film\" was terrible. I have a few reasons for why this \"Film\" is terrible, so here they are:1) Demonizing Atheists - If you want to watch something that makes atheists look like awful people, then look no further and rent this garbage movie on Amazon! I will bring up how people who aren't Christians are demonized later, but I think this point really stands out from that. For one, the main antagonist of the story, Professor Raddison, makes all of his students write,\"God is dead,\" on a piece of paper, which already makes no sense. What professor would ever do that in a real life situation? Anyway, aside from that, this film makes it look like all atheists just hate God and hate Christianity, when most atheists don't hate God or Christianity, they just don't see much proof for God and they don't believe in Christianity. This film also makes it seem like all atheists become atheists because something tragic happens to them, which is so nonsensical and just dumb it hurts.2) There are like 5 stories going on at once - This film is a mess. Instead of focusing on the main character Josh's \"Struggle\" to protect his faith against Professor Raddison, the people who made this movie had to make like 4 other stories and force them all into the same movie so they could mesh together at the end. First there's the story line of Professor Raddison, then there's a storyline of a relationship between Josh and some girl (I forgot what her name was), then there's ANOTHER storyline where a reporter gets cancer, then there's ANOTHER storyline where there's a girl who pretends to be Muslim but in all reality she's a Christian and- Good lord, what is with all the story lines? I have 2 guesses for why the makers of this \"Film\" added so many stories together in 1 \"Film\":1) They knew they would run out of arguments for Josh and Raddison to have, so they put in the extra stories.2) They wanted the movie to piece together at the end. I'm looking more towards the first option.3) Anyone who isn't a Christian is a bad person or something terrible happens to them - Here's the one that is the most infuriating to me. The father of the girl who pretends to be Muslim beats her and kicks her out when he finds out she's been listening to Bible lessons, Professor Raddison is portrayed as a bad person just simply because he's an atheist, the reporter lady, who's an atheist in the context of the \"Movie\", gets cancer, like what? The ending is what infuriates me the most. Raddison gets hit by a CAR and dies. Like, oh my god, who wrote this?!The only \"Good\" things in this \"Film\" (If we're stretching the meaning of good) are the cinematography and acting, which is why I gave this film a 2 star instead of a 1 star rating. Overall, the \"Film\" is terrible.",

Everyone has run into some people like the characters, and the movie gives various reasons why people are the way they are. Josh's statement of one is willing to sacrifice if one has true faith is the thesis which drives the movie. The movie asks the questions about why do good people suffer and bad people live well? Can science and religion co-exist? Is there a plan for this life? What creates one's self worth? I like the themes that there is kindness and peace in this life, and even when events go wrong there is a hand which guides us if we are willing to listen. Seven stars out of ten.

The actors and their acting is excellent, the film production & directing excellent, and The Message life-changing! Before we went to the film, i carefully read all of the reviews; the ''1s'' were at the beginning, and my oh my, what a contrast of reviews by those of various World Views! i was pleased to read one Critic Review by a man who did not instantly ''take sides'' and diss the movie off-hand; he actually looked at all aspects with an open, unbiased mind, and wrote a quality review. Hopefully some of the nay-sayers will take what the movie is putting forth and give it some serious consideration....... A most humorous observation is that people who wrote reviews either LOVED it or Hated it; what an eyeopening ''education'' to read all the reviews! BUT, can we be tolerant, loving, open minded, and forgiving of everyone in hopes of living peacefully? In an ideal world YES, but on this beleaguered planet, perhaps not.... God Is Good All The Time! All of us in our group who saw it will be going back a few more times! i, for one, want to give my movie dollars to helping promote GREAT film making - quality actors, quality acting, quality production and directing! Sadly, most ''God Movies'' are pretty poorly made; the message may be terrific, but if the production and acting is not first rate, then that message can be easily lost on anyone but the most die hard fan....Granted, this is not a film for everyone {tho it is meant to be for everyone, just as God absolutely positively loves everyone, PERIOD!!}, the same way that many movies are not for everyone. But may each person who views this film listen carefully to each ''case for God,'' each scientific fact, each argument, and with an open mind, consider what could be.....In a world of violence, hatred, ugliness, and ''man's inhumanity to man,'' an uplifting film is certainly a welcomed relief! Not only uplifting, but Life Changing, for God so loved/loves the world that He gave His only begotten Beloved son Jesus to be our Friend, our Hero, our Savior, our Everything! Ours was a nearly packed theater, on a Tuesday early afternoon even! There were many cheers, and many who were singing along with The Newsboys at the end! this is a MUST GO movie!!",

            "content": "God's Not Dead is the newest strategy for Christians to convince themselves that they're the ones being oppressed by the atheists, the homosexuals, the Muslims, and the feminist/pro-choice advocates. Not the other way around. It seems paranoid and conceited to believe that everyone is out to get the Christians when our American currency still reads \"In God We Trust.\" The film consists of a ragtag group of actors that you probably (and hopefully) won't see in any new blockbuster film. Shane Harper, whose claim to fame is that he's been in more Disney productions than is probably healthy, plays the main character. It's like Disney spliced all three Jonas brothers together to make one big douche. Kevin Sorbo has never been in any feature length films that I've ever heard of, yet he also plays a major role in this film.The plot of this 113-minute saga follows college freshman Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper), a devout Christian. His antagonistic Philosophy teacher Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) demands that his entire class renounce Christianity by writing \"God Is Dead\" on a piece of paper. Interestingly, he doesn't request anyone to disavow Allah or forsake Buddha. When Josh refuses, Radisson demands that Josh must prove God's existence to the class or fail the course. Ignoring the fact that no college professor in his right mind would risk being fired to convince one student that God isn't real, this movie is still far from plausible. Josh's college must have the best tenure of any college in America. None of Josh's classmates are willing to report Radisson and instead ostracize our beloved academic martyr Josh. The movie desperately tries to make Josh's \"proof\" of God's existence profound, but not surprisingly he proves nothing. It does succeed in making atheists look stupid and irrational, however. Which is probably the point. It turns out that Radisson actually does believe in God, but just hates him for killing his mother with cancer when he was 12. Judging from Kevin Sorbo's age, this occurred almost half a century ago. The movie ends with Radisson getting run over by a truck, probably God's payback for the professor's blasphemy. Luckily before he dies, he allows Jesus into his heart so his soul can be saved. Worse mistakes have been made in the face of death.For really no reason at all, the Robertson's of the hit reality television show \"Duck Dynasty\" made a cameo appearance. It just goes to show how much religious films desperately appeal to the rednecks of America as their audience. Not surprisingly, this movie is funded almost exclusively by Christian associations and Christian record labels. I bet if you dig deep enough, Chick-fil-A is sponsoring it too, but I'm not willing to fall that far down the rabbit hole. The first endorsement on their website is Trevor Bayne. If you're not familiar with him, chances are you're part of the 95% of Americans too intelligent to watch the Daytona 500. Maybe getting a NASCAR driver to recommend God's Not Dead will bring in that redneck demographic it so desperately needs. With movies like God's Not Dead, Passion of the Christ, and Noah becoming more and more popular, I have a feeling that we haven't seen the last of having other people's religion shoved down our throats. If you ARE a devoted Christian, chances are you would definitely enjoy this movie. It will give you all the warm fuzzy feelings that Miracle on 34th Street gave you back in the 90's, with the same amount of believability. For the rest of us, a negative 2 star rating.",

The answer of course is obviously no however for decades many Christians have suffered great career consequences for standing up for their faith. Recently even Bill Nye the Science Guy was debating similarly with Ken Ham of the Creation Museum. While, I understand the Atheist's who are posting angry reviews because they feel their views were not given equal time in the film the truth is none of them to date after decades of debate have presented a convincing argument otherwise, including Bill Nye's most recent attempt; which successfully proves that their view of the universe is not any more scientifically correct than many faith based views. It is a hard pill for Atheists to swallow however the truth is the truth and they simply should at the very least respect the opportunity to hear the other side even when they do not accept it. In my opinion, science could learn a lot from the Bible because they go pretty much hand in hand in order of things.",

May not agree with it tough.Now for the movie its self it was not good at all, so let me sum that all up.Voice acting 1/10- Very bad dialogue it was cheesy and corny and just plain awful like they never even tried.Story 2/10- No real story just a bunch of pointless sayings that goes nowhere.general acting 4/10- They tried to hard to be funny, but was not.Over all appeal 2/10- I highly do not recommend this film unless you're a Hardcore Christian.

Second...all were made in God's image, meaning all of us are capable of being loving, peaceful, merciful and caring individuals whether we are actively practicing Jesus' teachings or not. Third...all suffer from imperfection so no one is capable of being sin free so should not throw stones like this movie did. Fourth...those who do not believe there is a God have most likely come to this conclusion because Christianity's history and present do not live up to the Bible's teaching, bringing reproach upon the Most High God in the Bible. Fifth... Science and the correct interpretation of creation in the scriptures actually agree and since \"Christians\" take a literal stand on 7 days (24hours) instead of figurative days, they make it unrealistic to a thinking person. Sixth...The God of the Bible is not and never was Jesus, he is God's Son and anointed King. He answers to the Most High. Christians are supposed to love one another and love their enemies, they fight in wars yet the Bible teaches not to kill. The power of God does not influence them and they wonder why oh why there are people who believe that God is dead or never existed in the first place. Seventh... to understand why the world is the way it is, you need to know that \"the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one\" and God is allowing mankind to rule himself \"to his destruction\". That kingdom that they pray for in the Lord's prayer is real and will \"crush and destroy all other kingdoms\" and bring a peace that will never end. The loving, merciful God of the Bible does not punish those that exercise free will... which is only a choice to obey him or disobey...he rewards those who obey with life,a better one after this one and those who chose to be independent of him get this life as all there is and return to the dust at death. No fiery hell, just non existence. There is so much more to the Bible than what the many churches of Christianity teach, much of it different since they are misled and deceived by traditional teaching just as the ones who ran the temples when Jesus stated \"you make the word of God invalid with doctrines of man\" they too, teach traditions and philosophy of man alongside scripture making it invalid. Pagan religion thrives in Christianity. The Truth is in the whole Bible, 1st Timothy 3:16, it is vital to all who want it John 16:3 This means everlasting life, taking in knowledge of You,the only true God AND of the one whom You sent forth, Jesus Christ. The sender and the sent are separate. Jesus ALWAYS DEFERED TO THE FATHER, GAVE HIM GLORY IN ALL THINGS. The world of Christianity would be shocked to know they are doing exactly the opposite of what Jesus taught. They do not even use God's name which is supposed to be sacred. Psalms 83:18...but find an older Bible, like 15 years or more since GODS NAME WAS REMOVED FROM THE KING JAMES BIBLE. It should be there over 7000 times but is only found in name places now. The New World Translation has it every where it is supposed to be and the Divine Name bible, the 400th anniversary edition of the King James version has it brackets after the title LORD appears. Back where it was removed from long ago. The movie thinks it is praising God but it does not show the qualities that Christians should have for every one ... Love. It shows as much bias as a commercial for Direct TV against having cable. It does nothing to express sound reasons for why anyone should believe in the Creator. The Bible expresses those reasons perfectly.",

The way that culture, and the average college campus goes, I wonder how my kids will EVER get out of it with a school-enforces sense of morality and ethics. Christian students have to understand their own faith/religion/worldview, in order to defend it against intellectual attacks. The movie does a very good job with that too. The university depicted in the movie is spot on. Professors or teachers with an atheist worldview make it their goal to \"knock faith out of the kids.\" A Christian worldview is one that depicts humility, love, and many of the ethics or morals that we should want in society, and out young students. Christians should be well prepared with the knowledge to support their faith. This is excellent, and I recommend thinking the thoughts that the movie suggests. Are you a person of faith? Why?

            "content": "When I watched the movie, I felt so disgusted.. How come people can make such movies and expect it to be watched in theaters? First of all the arguments that the student presented are completely a bull. Stephen Hawking was completely misunderstood by this character and may be by the world. He said, Philosophy is dead because it has not upgraded itself with the scientific advancements.. One should not forget that the earlier scientific and mathematical logic were from the philosophies of great philosophers thinking.. And the modern philosophy did not evolve as fast as the science and hence he said philosophy is dead.. Also the other argument of Hawking that was refuted by John Lennox is also faulty.. Hawking's argument was defeating the purpose of a creator and that might offend religious fellows. But that statement of him did not refute or support the existence of god but merely removes the need for having a creator for everything.. And that's absolutely a statement of its own. John lennox, probably a believer, did not understand this statement and hence made his attempts to make this statement look nonsense.. These are my general analysis of the contents used in this movie.. the movie is pathetic.. all the characters were irritatingly dramatic and stupid.. I finally come to think after watching this movie that religious people are profoundly stupid in proving their faith to be superior.. If I have to evaluate it, I will give 0/100. Useless movie and screenplay.. And the world consists of 98.72% idiots and hence this movie will also be watched and they will make their money..",

Unlike many Christian films, this film is extremely well acted, written and produced. Kevin Sorbo gives a performance that is gut-wrenching and convincing to the end. The other actors demonstrate skill in the acting art. The message centers around a professor who attacks faith (specifically, Christianity) in a way that is common at college campuses throughout America. One student stands up to him and is challenged to defend his position, which he does quite well. Other subplots deal with related characters dealing with personal crises. All of the scenes are handled subtly and skillfully. Overall, the film is thought provoking, powerful and still quite entertaining.",

Instead, the whole movie has the feel like it was made for TV. Moving from Josh to the professor to the minister to the Muslim girl to the reporter to the elderly lady with dementia and her children made the film disjointed and unfocused.And yes, as stated here many times, the portrayal of Christians as more-or-less perfect and non-Christians as either angry, selfish, violent, calculating and/or uninformed was shortsighted. Even the only student (that I could see) who didn't stand up in the final classroom scene was a slovenly reminder of the comic book guy from the Simpsons.There were a couple of bright points, namely Kevin Sorbo as the professor, who did well given the material (which surprised me as I never took him seriously as an actor since Hercules). But while most Christians will likely enjoy this film, those seeking an honest portrayal of the debate at the heart of the story will probably be disappointed. The heavy-handed message of Christians= good, non-believers=bad will unfortunately turn off a lot of folks and, most sadly as a Christian, minimize the impact of the actual debate portrayed within.Future Christian films need to be, ironically, more honest\u0085in regards to their characters. No Christian is perfect (only one man lived a perfect life, yes?), and not all non-believers are negative and confrontational.All this being said, I look forward to more Christian films being made, with the mistakes of this one taken to heart.",

            "content": "This is a good, wholesome, and uplifting Christian movie demonstrating Christian values and principals with an awesome soundtrack and ending to boot! Some people have given this movie a bad review based primarily on the Christian content. If you are not a Christian, don't believe the Bible or are offended by it, disagree with the values and principles that Christianity holds to, then there is a good chance you might not enjoy this movie. If those things bother you, it would probably be a good idea not to torture yourself by watching a movie that is full of things you disagree with or are offended by from beginning to end. If you are a Christian or are not opposed to or offended by core Christian teachings and values, you should give this film a shot.The debate over the existence of God between the Christian student and the atheist Professor is only one of the story lines in the film, all of which correlate with the theme of \"God's not dead.\" The actual classroom debating is not very long, is split up over 3 class sessions, and is not deeply academic. This was an excellent choice for a movie that is being marketed to a broad age range, a large percentage of which is likely to be made up of high school aged church youth groups. The plot makes up for this by having the debate at the freshman level, and in an introductory philosophy class, rather than a physical science class, which would have demanded much more rigorous scientific research and debate. Another reviewer has remarked that the only things offered for the existence of God in the movie were a few verses from Genesis, however the student used all the other non-Biblical information that he presented as proof for God's existence also. Using primarily Bible verses to prove God to an atheist who doesn't believe the Bible any more than he believes in God wouldn't be a very productive strategy to win such a debate.I recommend that anyone considering this movie evaluate in advance if it is the kind of movie and subject matter that you would enjoy or might be offended by, and then make the decision to see it or something else. In my opinion, it is a good movie with high Christian values and a great message.",

And the atheist professor's points were too easy for him to prove wrong. I mean, everyone who wasn't a believer in Christ was automatically a villain. Atheists just don't believe in a god. The professor who is an atheist, was just overly antagonistic and was shamed for what he didn't believe in. 2) The Muslim faith was way out of whack. I have done studies into the Islamic faith in class. If the girl is going to be covering her hair, then she's certainly going to have to cover her arms! Now. There are many exceptions. Some don't cover their hair, it's wide in variation. But this was just stereotypical. And as for the father abusing her for her faith? *Ahem*,Muslims don't force people into their religion!!! It's highly against their faith! This was offensive and utterly disgraceful. They were bashing another religion, which brings me to my next point.3) Christians. They stereotyped us as angelic and the godly beings. No. That's wrong. We don't force our religion down people's throats. Granted at the end the main protagonist said specifically that God gave us a choice. But still, yet again, he bashed the other religions. Check the Bible again. Love thy neighbor. Where was this again? Oh yeah, didn't see it. It was offensive to not only atheists, but to Christians and Muslims as well. This is giving people another reason to hate us. Really? True Christians aren't going to shove their religion down people's throat nor condemn people to hell. Minor do we think of ourselves as empowered individuals. We are all human.4) I don't know what school bashes religion at all. Professors and teachers alike are strictly told not to sway someone's opinions. They are to respect them as such. It is, after all a professional environment.In conclusion, this movie was insulting, highly offensive, and very misleading. I wanted to see both viewpoints of atheism and theism. Both non-biased arguments that actually have an equal ground. It was ironic how they mentioned bias in the classroom. Bias, eh? Go on, please.",

However, when I saw a Muslim woman in the film I thought to myself that it could be good, for it would include several points of view and a multi-religious perspective. Wrong! Many other reviewers have pointed out the wide variety of the movie's flaws, so I am just going to stress the fact that this movie is endorsed by the American Family Association, which is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Yes, they have said terrible things about Muslims in the past (no wonder why the Muslim father is \"violent and intolerant\", to use the words they have used on Islam as a whole). I know \"God's not dead\" refers to Nietzsche's famous statement, but a more accurate title for this movie would be \"Jesus is not dead\", because it is Christian propaganda, and nothing else. I stayed until the end just to see if it was going to get better, but no, it didn't, it just got worse.

I have to say I greatly underestimated their understanding. When my daughter informed me the star of the movie was from one of her Disney shows, I just knew they would be alright.What was awesome about this movie was the realism. In my life I have come in contact with people represented by each character in the movie. Especially the narcissistic professor who corrupts data to get across a particular anti-Christian point of view. The scene at the house party struck me as a perfect way to represent the arrogance and corruption of a leftist educational system that self-validates their denial of the truths of our creator. Even the melancholy of the believer who doesn't know why God has placed him in a particular service was powerfully displayed by the pastor who couldn't get his rental car straightened out. And the attitude of his contemporary from a more challenging home land.At the end of the movie my son asked me why do they hate God so much?

Seriously, it's pretty much NEEDED in a corrupted Hollywood.This is a movie for non-believers & believers, Christians and atheists alike - even those involved in the occult or false philosophy.Trust me when I say, the writers, directors, and actors worked their BUTTS off to get this movie as accurate as possible; with Logic, Reason, and Truth! Atheistic & skeptics (as smart as they want people to think they are) always use the same flawed arguments, straw men, circular reasoning, insults, wrong conclusions, rudeness, and red-herrings. There record or reputation has SHOWN that.Credulous, gullible, and naive people who go off to high school / college face these kind of challenges to their faith in Christ every day! It's a good thing a movie about this reality was made for those wrestling with this problem! You gotta give it credit for that!And I'm glad they even included a person from a communist country, an Arab person persecuted for their faith, & a person with cancer, because these types of situations are important too! Unlike Matthew Chapman's \"The Ledge\" (which I call \"The 90-Minute Strawman\") which was made to shameless throw dirt on Christians, God, and the Bible; hated that Patrick Wilson, Charlie Hunnam, Liv Tyler, etc were dragged into such a \"hate speech\" flick). Easy for him to do, because he can put it up there on a big screen, and Christians can't entirely defend themselves. That's why a film like is greatly necessary to combat all these lies & falsehoods. Plus, they know NOT to lie! (Commandment #9) So, they're likely to make a more truthful film than an atheist who doesn't believe in right & wrong. lol wut?? And don't get the idea that the professor was killed off in the movie because the movie creators didn't \"like\" - it was an ACCIDENT in the story! Bad things happen, accidents happen! That's the way it is in this fractured fallen sin-cursed creation.Many out there will make negative comments about this movie and that is their right, but it is also my right to praise this film and the Message it gives to all.PS: The only downside to this film is that it tries to lump Darwinian evolution with God's Word - CAN'T be done seeing how *everything* between the Bible and evolution is backwards.PS2: Go Newsboys!! ;-D",

It's point is like a meteor striking the Earth: Christianity and Christians are the only true believers. But it makes this point by making the Christians in the movie the arrogant, intolerant, unmoving bigots (mostly because of the way they choose to portray non-Christians). A college professor telling an incoming Freshman that he will ruin his life if he continues his attempt to prove God's existence, a girlfriend breaks up with her boyfriend because he won't stop trying to prove God's existence, a couple who breakup because the woman learns she has cancer (all within about 5 minutes) highlights what little the makers of this movie know about setting up an argument. We are to hate the non-Christians because they refuse to listen to the reasonable Christian, but we are to admire the Christians for basically the same lack of respect of others beliefs. The movie shrugs off scientific theories by pointing to a quote from the bible (\"Let there be light\" refers to the Big Bang????), but ignores other scientific issues (rife with evidence) such as the origin of man and God creating man in his own image, by not mentioning it at all.The creators of this movie missed a grand opportunity to introduce their philosophies and beliefs to the public by boiling every situation down to We're Right, You're Wrong. It's this attitude and the resulting childish, insulting, and bigoted portrayal of non-Christian characters that make this movie an utter failure.",

That's like me doing a review on \"Letting go of God\". I cannot possibly give an impartial review on an atheist movie, so my opinion really cannot be counted.Second, Throw out all of the reviews that start out \"I'm not an atheist\". Only an atheist trying to give creditably to his/her negative review would write something like that.Third, Throw out the reviews that do not state their beliefs, one way or the other, they could be either, so to be fair, discard them both.Lastly, The reviews that start out with \"I am a Christian\", since no real self respecting atheist could possibly write those words, you can assume the review is done by a Christian. These are the reviews you should pay attention to. Since only a Christian could possibly give a creditable review of a Christian movie as good or bad, these are the reviews you should give weight to.",

Near the end of the movie he's beginning to realize that GOD is real, and is close to changing. But on his way to a Christian concert he is suddenly hit by a car and dies a few minutes later. A Pastor does lead him to GOD as he's dieing, so he does go to Heaven. But I would've liked it a lot better if he had made it to the concert and met Josh there. He could've gotten saved then, and changed his teaching style, becoming a new man. This would've been a much happier ending. I imagine that the writers considered this, but their goal is not simply just to entertain, but to lead people to GOD, and I do commend them for this. Perhaps they felt that the way they did it would be more effective, but it's not the way I would've done it, it was very painful this way.",

They are so smart and have such prejudice in favor of the world view they've been fed that that they forgot to listen carefully to the movie's dialog. Not one of the Christians demands that people abandon their own beliefs because the Christians say so. In fact, just the opposite, one of Josh's main points is that we all have the free will to choose to believe in God or not. All the rest just flows from that. Even the atheists and agnostics believe something, as Josh points out, to include the professor requiring students to believe there is no God. So if there's something you can't see that you have to believe in, then I fail to understand how human logic can declare that believing in God is either pointless or irrelevant. The opposing diatribe in these IMDb reviews is basically the kind of bigoted anger that many non-Christians like to believe all Christians display. But the reality is different. Look up Christ's Sermon on the Mount, and tell me what is hateful there. This movie has a few fairly trite lines of dialog, but that's about it. The rest is well-communicated by the actors/actresses, and there are a ton of reminders that so much in life happens for a reason, such that in that way it preserves fidelity to a life based upon faith. I have watched non-Christian movie and TV content at the urging of friends; they don't demand it, and then crow about how this \"proves\" that faith and Christianity and God are wrong or nonexistent. Instead they just ask me to keep an open mind, usually. What I find in the end is that when I apply my free will and logic to the great questions, I end up right where the character John is. I have considered in my own quiet thinking times just what makes most sense to me as a human being, and I have to say that declaring that there is no God, and that there is no God who has a personal relationship with individuals, just makes so much less sense than the alternative. I encourage all of you who have written reviews without even attending the movie, to suspend your disbelief for just a couple hours, and listen open-minded, not with an ear toward refuting but with the same open mind that people profess to have addressed to Mormonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Taoism, etc., and then make your choice from free will after really listening. The professor in the movie is not so much a caricature as some would have you believe. We all know people who've declared that they see little point in having faith, and some will even die that way; that's their choice. Is the movie a little shallow in places? Sure, if it had really explored the full relationships, the movie would have been much longer, or have removed some of the augmenting story lines. Instead, we get a small glimpse into the kinds of people some characters portray, and quite frankly, I've me all those kinds in my life. Go see it, then decide for yourself. I enjoyed it, it moved me, it renewed my faith, and it told the right story.",

Connecting them all near the end was genius. I particularly enjoyed how this film made me feel. I haven't been able to cry in a movie for a couple years now. It's sad to lose that human feeling. This movie has some very emotional parts and I was very grateful to have seen them. If you go into this movie with an open mind... You will really enjoy this movie. You don't need to believe what is being said. Watching a movie will never change someone's view on what you believe. The point of a movie is to broaden the mind and give light to new ideas. This can relate to any genre. A Sci-Fi enthusiast loves to watch something new, something he or she has never seen before. Will you tell them that they shouldn't watch it because they need to stick to the norm, and that watching something that isn't real or cant be proved is pointless. You would never do that.So why do we hinder in the religious area?It does not matter if I am a Christian or not. What matters is what the viewer of the movie feels.This is an inspirational film. It does not criticize. They never say Atheism is wrong or right. They offer an opinion that they believe and nothing more.Even me writing this review will mean nothing. I have not changed anyone's opinion; words typed on a computer will likely mean nothing to a hardened heart.When your heart is hardened like the professor's or like pharaoh from the bible. Nothing will ever change what they feel until the very end. Tell me why it is the natural way of a human being to cry out to God when something isn't going according to plan? It is because we were all born with a connection to God. We all know there is emptiness inside us without... (Something) What is that? Some fill it with drugs, alcohol, pleasure, and money. But no one is ever satisfied. What good does it do for people to win the whole world yet lose their lives? We are losing our soul. God fills that emptiness.Why would anyone want to even chance the possibility of God not being real?Say I was born in a lab and had no connection with the outside world. When I turn 18 a man comes in and says: \"You have 3 options for your life: 1. Believe nothing, live for a while, and die. 2. Believe in God, go to heaven, live forever.Who in their natural unbiased mind would ever choose 1.? Why would someone ever risk this choice? Let's not even add the truth that with option 1. Comes the linked option 3. Burn in hell for all of eternity.God gave us the greatest gift of all... FREE-WILL. No one is ever forced into choosing one or the other. Maybe you are in the middle and don't know what to think. Get some answers from both viewpoints. Your heart will tell you what to believe. They called it the holy spirit in this movie. You will know what is right and what is wrong, there is no in between.If you actually took the time to read anything I wrote, I thank you. I pray you have a great day. If you want to talk, you know my name.I'm only 17, I am not a pastor. I am a regular guy, but I love talking to people and giving any advice I can. ~Jaeden Bailas",

I was excited with the overall plot, quality, and especially music. Sadly, this has received lots of ridicule simply because it is a Christian film. The biggest problem? \"Stereotypes.\" First of all, this is not supposed to be a completely realistic film; it is like reality TV in the sense that there is a lot that does not necessarily occur. The abusive Muslim father is one example: the director was not saying that Muslims were abusive. He merely used the example of a daughter leaving her faith, the faith held by her proud father. If this situation held an abusive Christian father and a Muslim daughter, would there be an uproar? Certainly not! I do admit, however, that the director could have been a little more sensitive to others (but this still was not the point!). Sadly, Christians are often portrayed as the idiotic, hateful people. Thank goodness for a film where that is not the case! God's Not Dead is definitely not as high-quality as something like Man of Steel, Star Wars, or Downton Abbey. Obviously, the budget was smaller. Big-name movie companies don't want to \"risk\" having a Christian movie under their belt and thus smaller companies are to be used.

Wow, it's definitely not very good. Heavy-handed propaganda doesn't begin to describe it. I literally felt like I was being whacked upside the head at times while watching this. The movie really dragged, too. Even just watching it at home I was bored halfway through & kept checking my phone for something to do. The characters in this movie, oh gosh, I don't even know what to say. Hardly any have any redeeming qualities. The main guy is OK, that's it. His (ex) girlfriend is the most annoying person ever with her \"choose me, I'm the most important thing in your life\" attitude. And of course she breaks up with him when he turns his attention to preparing for the debate against his prof. Seriously, I can't understand her attitude. They've been together 6 years and I'm going to assume he's been a Christian for that period of time. But this is supposedly news to her that his faith is very important. Anyway, all the scenes with her were really annoying. The prof was just awful. No redeeming qualities. I didn't even sympathize with him after finding out his mom died when he was a kid. You can tell he's still carrying a lot of pain but the way the character is written it's hard to even somewhat like him. His first confrontation (outside his classroom) with Josh was just so over the top, with him practically threatening Josh. It's incredibly hard to believe a professor would act like that & also hard to believe the student wouldn't go right to the Dean or someone to complain. The arrogant, go-getter lawyer was so annoying. Mean, petty, nothing to like. I actually really like Dean Cain and am sad he was cast as this horrible character. And his girlfriend? What was up with her?? There was barely a point to her character. All she did was \"interview\" (more like throw ridiculous questions and accusations) at well-known Christians who happen to stroll into town. And one of her targets is the Duck Dynasty guy!!!

If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.

If God is truly dead then why should an atheist even care what I watch or believe unless he's turned his atheism into a religion as well. As for the Muslim father you saw a man who loved his daughter dearly but responded w/anger much like other \"religious\" parents respond when they can't control the child & think they are going to hell.The abuse is never right but I've never met someone that was in a orthodox religion of any kind that casually accepted their child leaving it.

            "content": "for starters, no professor who acted like Kevin Sorbo did would EVER have a job for long ay ANY university. The way he acts is totally unprofessional and as pointed out by numerous other reviews is a tyrant, not really an atheist or even a good teacher for that matter. How he remained a teacher for this long is beyond me. Maby being an evil atheist, and no goodnick he had blackmail pictures of the dean in drag or something.Another fact that was pointed out as this horribly enforces Every, and I mean every single non-Christian in the movie is an amoral, annoying, arrogant, jerk. Every single Christian (except that annoying girlfriend) is a moral, righteous, considerate person. The Muslim family was probably the worst stero type in this bad propaganda film.Also it was propaganda for the Newsboys if you could not tell between the first few minutes of the film. The ending was also complete and utter crap. When someone gets struck by a freaking car you don't start jammering to them about god, you call the damn ambulance and make sure the victim is coherent and such.There really was no debate between God vs Science in this film. It was a one-sided debate as it was probably meant to be. Even worse, the film's attempts to explore physics and philosophy are excruciatingly reductive. Rather than taking an honest approach to Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, the bulk of which is actually a compelling analysis of M-theory, the film dumbs down Hawking's book as nothing more than an affront to God (which, incidentally, the film never clearly defines). Similarly, it takes the genuinely thought-provoking character of the madman in Nietzsche's The Gay Science and dumbs it down to the single, literalist, out-of-context phrase \"God is Dead.\" The film's disconnect with reality is further exemplified in the character of Amy Ryan, who proudly displays an American Humanist bumper sticker next to the one that reads, \"I love evolution.\" When asked where she derives her hope, Amy has no recourse but to walk away sullenly. If the writers of God's Not Dead had actually bothered doing their research, perhaps they would have referred to Nikki Stern's Hope in Small Doses, published by the American Humanist Association.In the end, if I were to ignore all of the awful stereotypes, disgusting pieces of Christian propaganda, and in general just insulting content, the movie would still be a 5/10 at best. The acting was weak, half of the film had zero to do with the main plot, and the main plot itself was hardly even compelling and completely unrealistic anyway. Avoid at all costs.",

            "content": "Well, what an awful movie. Apart from the very very bad acting, this film also suffers from poor writing and lack of knowledge necessary for its' premise. To begin with, as a philosophy student myself, I understand the philosophy professor's need to have an atheist class. But there is absolutely no need to be an ass-hole about it. Especially not in the first lecture! So this I didn't understand.Also in the opening lecture scene, the prof states that all the philosopher's on the board were atheists. Now here comes the films lack of knowledge of its' own premise - as Scottish Philosopher David Hume was arguably not an atheist. Although he would've been more inclined to this belief, because of his devout Empiricism, he can never rule out the possibility of things such as God or Miracles, even though he thinks it's not rationally justifiable to believe in them. Thus leading to many interpretations of Hume as being a \"skeptical agnostic\" (including my Philosophy lecturer - who is Hume's biggest fan!)A few more scenes in and very poor acting is apparent, as well as huge script flaws with dialogue riddled with clich\u00e9s. However, this isn't the worst part.When the main character (the God believing student) starts giving his lectures on how and why God exists and why you should believe him, the professor seems to become more and more unable to cope with his arguments. I was watching this and thinking \"how has someone who cannot argue against a student about the existence of God get a degree in anything, let alone Philosophy and thus teach this subject?????\". It is genuinely baffling, as the professor cannot respond to simple suggestions which are ridiculed by today's atheists and philosophers.About 3 quarters of the way through then, I come to the conclusion that this film is bad. However, the student's 3rd and final lecture to the other students provided me with what I believe to be one of the most ridiculous and laughable scenes to ever come from a serious production. Supposedly, the students have been convinced by the theist's reasons for believing in God, to the dismay of the professor. And, one by one, the students begin to stand up and say \"God's Not Dead\" in contrast to Nietzsche's famous quote. It's an \"I'm Spartacus\"-like event happening in the lecture theatre and as a result is both cringe-worthy and appalling from any perspective. How any production company looked at this part of the script in particular and gave it the go ahead to be made as quite a big movie is completely beyond me. It is an offence to both Kubrick and \"Spartacus\", as well as Nietzsche and his brilliant quote.Top tip: don't watch this film. Top tip #2: Definitely don't watch this film if you're someone with even the slightest bit of philosophical knowledge - it will just anger you. As it did with me.But please, do yourself a favour and watch some Dawkins/Hitchens on YouTube instead.X",

            "content": "This movie presents the ongoing debate between those who believe in God and those who do not. Not all Christians in the movie are portrayed positively, either. For instance, the girlfriend of the main character, Josh Wheaton, disagrees with Josh's decision to take a stand for his faith. Josh is also advised by his parents to not take a stand and just sign the paper stating that God is dead. I think the movie does an excellent job of depicting the influence that one or two people can have on others. Because of Josh's stand, a Chinese student accepts Christ as his Savior. Christians today are so easily silenced by the world and those who hate God, but the world needs to see what can happen when just one person stands up for Truth. The old lady with dementia spoke about the devil giving people trouble free lives to keep them from seeing their need for God. She stated what all Christians know and believe, Sin is a cage that locks a person in. God gives people opportunities to turn from their sins (the cage door opens) but, eventually every person must make a choice about God before the cage door is closed and locked for good.Maybe some of the characters were extreme stereotypes, but the characters did represent people from all walks of life. Many of the situations the characters faced are realistic. A Muslim girl is disowned because of her faith in Jesus. A woman with cancer has no hope until she finds hope in Jesus. A worldly and ruthless lawyer has heard the Truth but has spent his entire life running from the truth. He loves the world and the things of the world too much to give his life to Christ. These are all situations that real people face. I think the movie presented several different scenarios that showed the real struggles people, Christian or not, face when it comes to the question of \"What will I do with God?\" It is a challenging and inspiring movie that is wholesome and it conveys a much needed message.",

Or is he her much older boyfriend? Can't tell. Creepy.\nAyn Rand is taught in philosophy classes. Rand as a towering intellect? This film is a comedy. I laughed for a minute straight.\nAtheism as a lesson? What? The entire concept of a secular university professor teaching that way is absurd. I went to UC Berkeley, the liberal, secularist bastion of society. We never discussed the existence of God because, well, that's religion, not philosophy. The closest we got to discussing God was in a Nietzsche class, where we had to learn and explain Nietzsche's ideas. We were never asked to believe, agree, or like any of it. Our goal was to learn, understand, explain, and identify strengths and weaknesses of complex ideas. We learned to think, not believe. Except for friends, I had no idea of my instructors or classmates were atheists or devout in anything. It just didn't come up, ever.\nBefore Berkeley, when I took a class named Magic, Witchcraft, and Religion, I learned a lot about magic, witchcraft, and religion across the world. I was never asked to believe or disbelieve any of it.\nA philosophy professor who doesn't understand the famous line of Nietzsche? He should demand his money back for that PhD, and every student in that class should demand their money back from the university for having such an incompetent teacher.\nThe film depicts blatant religious persecution that would cause a lawsuit and a riot at Berkeley. None of us would have sat through such bullying. I'm sure it happens sometimes somewhere, but demanding a class to write that God is dead? That's dramatic, but it's absurd. It builds on the belief that Christians are persecuted in America, which is pretty hilarious since Christians largely control America. Remember, even Biden is Catholic, along with much of the Supreme Court. Then again, Trump as a Christian? Hard for me to believe considering all he has said and done.\nNo philosophy class asks students to defend or attack their own ideas. If there's one area philosophy professors don't care for one bit, it's the ideas of their students. Jesus Christ, I'm almost 15 minutes into the film and I've written 370 words of how it's gotten so much wrong in such childish ways. I tried watching more, but it's like pulling toenails, so I fast-forwarded and jumped around.Anyway, I thought this would be fun with 4-5 beers. It isn't. It's just poorly made schlock.

Secondly, it is not mandatory in the Islamic faith for a woman to cover her face. THe women that do CHOOSE to cover their face, first cover the rest of their body, not just wear jeans and a t-shirt. Also, it is actually Muslim tradition that the parents make sure the girl is married into a safe and nice household. Very very rarely, if ever, would you see a family kicking out their daughter. All the parts in the movie that assassinated the Islamic faith were especially disrespectful considering they had absolutely nothing to do with the main plot of the movie, which was the student disproving the professor. The girlfriend of 6 years dumped the student because he was taking on the argument. The man who was ignorant to his mother was the brother of the professors girlfriend. Those minor story-lines were in some way tied to the main plot. The Muslim part was in no way related. it was put in to specifically make Islam look bad. Honestly, I have no respect for this movie so it does not change my stance on Christianity. My closest friends are all Christian and I have deep admiration for the Christian faith. I simply hate this movie and am disgusted at the entire production crew and director.I am a Muslim and I was very proud to see so many reviews of people (many of them Christian) showing their dissatisfaction of the movie because of how it offended everybody of non- Christian faith.

An Arab-Muslim college student (played by a non-Muslim) is seen as being oppressed by her chauvinistic and abusive father who makes her do everything he says that she should. The burqa (a religious head wear) is worn by this girl and takes it off when her father is not around, because she disapproves of Islam. As she does this, a white-American girl approaches her saying that she wished the Arab-Muslim girl didn't have to wear a burqa because it is archaic and unfair, and the Muslim girl agrees saying that she does it because her father makes her. This Muslim girl is portrayed as a victim of her own religion, and her family because of something that the writers and producers of this movie do not understand. As if that is not prejudiced enough, the girl is a Christian in hiding because she is afraid of what her father might do to her. What is even more racist is that her father finds out and physically abuses her, and literally drags the girl out of the house. I was truly disappointed to see how such an open-minded movie (at first) was so inappropriate and actually narrow-minded.

I don't want to repeat what others have said just try balance the haters from the lovers. I can see why some find the one Muslim family offensive as certainly not all Muslim's are like that, as also they say not all atheists had some past hurt and were Christians before. However, no-one asks you to generalize and transfer this to a group, it is a story and it can't be a story about millions of people and it is not about that one person in a story trying to represent millions anymore than Hannibal in Silence of the lambs represents all murderers. Not all murderers eat their victims it is story about that one murderer. If people making these comments easily accept that the bad guy in secular a movie does not represent and entire population then why can't they accept that these characters are about one person, why generalize in a Christian movie, that is hypocritical. Each character in this movie represents one person, we can all relate to someone like that, I've experienced people just like these characters. Not all atheists were Christians and are mad at God true, but there are some that are and this movie chose to tell a story about one person like that, they had to choose one type, they can't represent a million in one story, no producer, secular or Christian can do that. Not all Muslim's disown their kids if they become Christian but you watch the news and know that is possible, we have read news stories of honor killings in the USA so I'm actually glad they did not choose to go further and use an honor killing as an example in this movie, they went to the middle, she was not accepted, but she was not killed which is a real life extreme that could have happened. No movie will ever get it right in making every person who sees it comfortable and get it perfect but this is a great way to open discussion, parents to see with their kids and talk about the pros and cons. On the way home I did tell my kids it was fundamental Muslim's who did that and that the crusaders did the same long ago, we spoke the Christian girlfriend who tried to get him to take the easy short-cut and how even Christian friends can try mislead you, we spoke about evolution, the big bang theory, great way to connect with kids in a movie you can actually take them to see, we need more like this, everything else is just sex, drugs and murder and no-one critiques those with the same kind of complaint and offense they have with faith based movies, always under heavier scrutiny and always people who will try find something wrong with it.

            "content": "As our culture grows increasingly ignorant of and hostile toward the Bible, \"God's Not Dead\" presents a defense. The student's apologetic deals with the primary arguments against the God of the Bible: 1) origin of the universe 2) macro-evolution vs. Biblical account of creation and 3) the existence of evil. There was a time in America during which Biblical literacy was presumed for anyone claiming to be educated. Harvard was America's first university, established in 1636 as the school for the training of Congregational pastors. It's present motto \"VERITAS\" (truth), is a contraction of the original \"Veritas Christo et Ecclesia\" (Truth for Christ and the Church).The religions of Secular Fundamentalism and Cosmic Humanism have replaced Christianity and run Judeo-Christian values out of favor and into derision. From the outset of our nation, the Northwest Ordinance (1787) legislated the teaching of religion, morality as well as knowledge throughout the new territories. The Biblical foundations of our nation have accounted for our stability, prosperity, liberty and benevolence. These features of America's exceptional-ism are jeopardized by our departure from the beliefs and values that come from a Biblical world view.This movie is more than an apologetic for God set within a dramatic framework. It raises the question to a secular world, \"From where comes your hope?\" If we and our world are purely the product of chance and time, in the words of Shakespeare (and Professor Radisson), \"Life is but a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\"While the debate portrayed is not trivial, the reason that those inhabiting a post-modern world need God removed, has more to do with denying accountability to a sovereign, omniscient, omnipresent and moral being. However, the minimalist government with maximum liberty imagined by our founders, could only be possible with the internal moral restraint of the conscience resulting from the Judeo-Christian religion. Without this, government requires external restraints. In the words of a 19th century Speaker of the House, Robert Winthrop:\"Men, in a word, must necessarily be controlled, either by a power within them, or by a power without them; either by the Word of God, or by the strong arm of man; either by the Bible, or by the bayonet.\"John Adams, who was not a trinitarian Christian opined, \"Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\"It would appear that we now are getting the government fitting for a people that have rejected God. While believers will get a lift from this film, it may be the only time that many Generation X and Millennials might hear cogent arguments presented for the existence of God. In our \"seeker sensitive\", program driven churches, this may be a rare time that many in church may hear a reason for faith that is something more than a message of self esteem or psychological self help.The concluding credits include numerous court cases, in which the universities have sought to suppress those with a Biblical world view,and someone has stood up for their freedom of conscience. There are aspects of the film that mirror a 2013 case involving Florida Atlantic University, in which a student was expelled for refusing to honor a professor's requirement that all in the class stomp on the name of Jesus written on a piece of paper. While the scripting is tightly contrived, it has to be in order to cover something as broad as a world view, which has become all but trampled beneath the feet of postmodern American idolatry.",

That is a very dangerous thing.This movie is racist and subjugates each person in the film who is not a Christian into a typical stereotype especially Asian and Muslim minorities. The movie is just stupid it's so clich\u00e9 and and the actors are absolutely horrible in this movie.

            "content": "Movie Overview: God's Not Dead College freshman, Josh Wheaton, reported for first day of classes, eying a future degree in law. A committed Christian, Josh expected to receive a higher education, not a tongue lashing, from his atheist philosophy professor about the first year student's Christianity.During his first lecture, Professor Radisson chided any professing belief in the antiquated God of the Bible. To kick-off the semester in Philosophy 101, Professor Radisson instructed the pupils to write \"God is Dead\" on a sheet of paper and turn it in, signed. With little or no forethought, the students, eager to please, signed the declaration....Well, all but Josh Wheaton.The Professor expected absolute obedience, and when Josh refused to sign the statement denying his faith, Radisson assigned Josh the daunting undertaking of proving God's existence.The question looms, will Josh stand resolved as Daniel in the Old Testament or compromise his faith to secure a passing grade in the mandatory class? Brief Review The movie captures a predicament devout Christians across America are facing. As the credits rolled, cases argued/defended by the Alliance Defense Fund revealed that \"persecution\" of Christian students on university campuses is not isolated. In fact, as our culture continues to embrace a more tolerant view of lifestyles the Bible specifically lists as sinful, the pressure to live wholly committed to Christ will become increasingly difficult. As Christianity becomes more and more unpopular, the students who dare refuse to participate in spiritually compromising lessons and assignments face potential retribution from professors who see themselves as \"god\" in their own schools of higher learning.Josh Wheaton, played by Shane Harper of \"Good Luck, Charlie\" fame, delivers a powerful and believable performance. His internal debate over compromising or \"swimming upstream\" is palpable. At one point, my wife leaned over and whispered, \"I feel so nervous for him.\" My heart raced with the same anxiety. Fantastic acting in this young man's fledgling career.Kevin Sorbo plays the part of Professor Radisson, the atheist. He, too played his role powerfully, causing me to be nervous whenever an encounter with Josh was imminent.This film delivers a timely message and definitely deserves a rating of \"family friendly.\" I can't imagine Willie and Korie Robertson (Duck Dynasty) making a cameo appearance in anything but...can you?",

I wasn't sure what to expect, other than what the trailer showed and that it looked like it could be a pretty good movie. I went to see it with my wife, my two sons and my parents. We encompassed three different generations. All three came away with the overall feeling that it was a wonderful movie that was well made. It had a few little things that each of us could pick out and maybe want to change (what movie doesn't), but those were personal preferences and didn't affect the overall feel of the film. There were numerous occasions during the film that had everyone in the audience cheering and moments that could also bring you to tears. If you go in with the mindset of being an atheist, then your mind was already made up and you will of course rate it accordingly (very low). If you go in with a Christian viewpoint and perspective then you will probably really enjoy it and rate it very high. If you go in with an open mind and are on the fence, this movie has the ability to move you and speak to your heart. I hope to see more family movies like this one that speak to the heart and the soul. It exceeded what I thought it would be and brings a message that is very important for today and the times that we live in. GOD'S NOT DEAD!",

The statement \"God is Dead\" implies that there was a God at some point. Not every atheist believes that.

It is doing just what its objective was---to create conversation, dialog, debate--and ENTERTAIN.I was originally going to give this movie a rating of 8-9, but changed it to a 10, simply because there are so many others rating it on the other side with a 1, which is totally unfair. It shows they are not being very objective. Just because non-Christians were depicted in a bad light, doesn't mean this film should be trashed. There are so many other movies that do the opposite--show religious, and people of faith as some sort of freak or hate monger.Why not just enjoy the show, and not look too much into the the \"agenda\" of the debate.",

Also to the many atheists out there; stop rating it badly simply because it's a Christian movie.

Nonetheless, even if it wasn't a rare case, it could still, and very likely has happened. As for the Muslim case, many think that the father was abusive, when he was only being very strict about his religion. It's not abnormal for daughters, and even sons to be thrown out of home for that. Again, a great story, and had me getting spine tingles the whole way through, and I hope that we can all follow the student's actions, and stand up for God, because I know He loves it.",

Today, non- believers want you to believe God is Dead or better yet that he never existed. They do not know any better as the serpent is within them and he tells them to do what you want because he does not want people to believe in God. For the wicked shall rule the Earth and for me, they can have the Earth as my eternal goal is Heaven and this movie says the same thing, you have a choice, you can believe or not believe. For the non-believers, I pray that you watch this movie and you realize that God is love, God is life, and God is eternal. He loves us and he wants the best for you and me.

After all...the Bible does say \"sow, water, harvesting\" maybe not be all done by one person in one go!Why are people expecting a film to give a full theological debate on the subject matter? It's made to make you think.. If you give someone a simple sum and the answer all the time there is little room for learning or individual thought on anything outside of the \"this is the answer\" instead of \"why\".I did think that it is a amazing film and whilst I read that some people are unhappy with the \"emptiness\" of texting at the end of the film.. I see this as a form of outreach and should be applauded.. God tells us (not demands) that we should speak of Him in ALL we do and in every way...

Another thing that really irritated me was the terribly weak arguments coming from the professor. Seriously. If you are a professor of philosophy and you can't come up with more than a quote from Stephen hawking than you need to go back to school. There is no real debate in this movie. Which is why the Christian won the debate. I would like to see the writer of this flick debate A.C. Grayling or Sam Harris.

            "content": ". . . at America's last college holding out against God--in Louisiana, of all places. (The end credits of GOD'S NOT DEAD document how Christians have sued every other U.S. university to force them to put their trust in God, as our money--coins and bills--requires.) Freshman Josh wants to join God's Legion of defense lawyers, and he takes \"Philosophy 150: Introduction to Philosophical Thought\" to cut his teeth on a really naive self-proclaimed \"atheist\" professor. Though a first-day-of-class poll shows that 98.75% of his lecture section consists of documented atheists, Josh easily converts 100% of these hold-outs to the Lord while the banners for Fall orientation are still displayed. Meanwhile, God implicitly sics cancer on the atheist reporter chick who harasses DUCK DYNASTY family members. The reporter's atheist lover is rattled when his mom (who hasn't strung a sentence together in years due to Alzheimer's) suddenly preaches a two-page sermon to him. So cancer gal's ex-lover (he dumped her the moment she said she had cancer) speeds away from Mom's nursing home and fatally hit-and-runs the atheist prof in front of Pastor Dave. Since Dave does NOT know First Aid (many Christians do not see the need for it), he asks the dying man for a confession instead, and the big old hypocrite confesses he's been an angry True Believer all along.Meanwhile, Martin--Josh's classmate from Communist China--upsets his dad back in Beijing with his conversion news. (China may be hopeless--there are just too many atheists; the Divine Plan could require some nukes.) The Muslim girl lurking in the background--Ayisha--turns out to be a secret Christian for the past year. Her little brother still is Muslim. Jealous Ayisha hasn't shared the Good News with him, he snitches her out to their Muslim father, who beats Ayisha and tosses her into the street. Though Pastor Dave was all thumbs at saving the professor's life through First Aid or prayer, he IS able to Faith Heal his foreign car (never touched by a Blue State hand). The bottom line here is that YOU better be on the Right Side of this God issue, or else. Bad things are sure to happen to every atheist, as well as to most if not all Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and Lutherans. But be forewarned: the crowd at my GOD'S NOT DEAD showing was far rowdier than the ones for CAPTAIN AMER1CA and DIVERGENT, what with all its clapping, foot-stomping, and hollered \"Amens!\" This was somewhat surprising to me, since half these grey-haired geezers came in pushing walkers. Sort of reminds one of Central Europe, in the 1930s.",

It would not stand a REAL confrontation, not even for a femtosecond.It's embarrassing. Are these the \"recruitment weapons\" of Christianity?

The main character Josh displays courage and the conviction to take on what is perceived to be an unpopular view of defending the existence of God. I found the movie to be realistic to todays culture as he defends what he believes and takes abuse from the \"tolerant\" secular world. We should cheer for movies that can stir emotions of sadness, joy, courage, and awe all without profanity and crudeness.

            "content": "To begin, I am a Christian, and am not afraid to say so.I have a legitimate question going out to atheists. Josh asks his professor why he hates God. While this may not be everyone's situation, but Josh also brings up the topic of agnosticism. Agnosticism being you don't know what it is you should believe.I cannot comprehend why someone would rate a film that has such a powerful message so poorly, beside biased interest. If an atheist were to come out with a film, \"God is Dead,\" and provided their standpoint on the issue, then many people would watch it, and it would have a very high rating. Why? Because more people are willing to accept that there is no God, than stepping out of their comfort zone and saying that their life is not their own. This is a tough decision to make.So what have I shown? So far, not much. Merely that more people would like to acknowledge themselves as the ultimate authority, rather than God. While, like in all cases, there will be exceptions with this theory.From a theist perspective, this movie has the potential to change many lives, if the people watching it were not coming to spit and scream at it. So, if the atheist can muster the ability to watch it again, then put yourself in a different standpoint. Try to see things from a different angle. How did humanity progress this far? People took the time to observe whether or not there was another way of looking at things. Take the heliocentric theory, for example. If Nicolaus Copernicus had not taken the time to look at it this way, science would not be where it is today. Take gravity. If Newton had not come to the conclusion that there must be a force that pulls things down, then, we would be in the same predicament.The only way to make progress is to keep going. However, if I keep going, I am going to make a lot of people mad.Regardless, here is my belief, and why I believe that, \"God's Not Dead,\" is right on the money: Christians believe that God created the world and everything in it over 6000 years ago. We believe that God the Father sent his one and only Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to take on the sins of the world. Everything you have done, I have done, and everything anyone has done. Being a Christian does not mean that we're perfect, after all, \"everyone,\" includes Christians as well. True Christians do not look down on anyone that does not share our belief. The only thing that makes us any different than an atheist is our view on God.So, to recap. Next time you watch this film, try to look at it from the theist perspective, instead of immediately pointing out the alleged, \"errors,\" of the Christian view.Matthew",

They elevate bad behavior and demonize those who at least strive to do the right thing. That's propaganda too.Many things I hated about this movie but one thing they said was excellent. It's every person's choice. I wish more people would take that freedom seriously and protect it more vociferously. We are losing our freedoms in this country because too many people have caved to the notion that what they choose for themselves, ought to be forced on everyone else. They put their own freedom at risk when they accept \"bans\" and overreaching government control. They just don't yet know it. I found plenty of things in this film offensive, not the least of which was the \"death bed conversion.\" But you know what? The constitution doesn't protect you from being offended.

Science attempts to explain how the universe works, and religion seeks to explain why. Furthermore, in my own personal experience, I discovered that Christianity is verifiable and true. I started out as an atheist, but I questioned too long and I discovered God in the person of Jesus Christ.To those who have commented here on the superficiality of the film's characters, I disagree. I have known several real life persons who are similar to the characters portrayed in the film. Specifically, the prof who taught my freshman philosophy class at university began the semester by asking for a show of hands from students who believed in God. He then said that he would repeat the question at the end of semester, and that he would give an automatic \"F\" to any student who still believed. Sorry, disbelievers, but that is a true story from real life.I applaud this film, and I thank all who participated in its production. To anyone who took the time and effort to post a bad review, I suggest that you might seek to open your mind and your heart. Your reaction just might be telling you something you should reconsider.God is real, and He will deny no one who approaches Him with an open heart and mind.",

Chances you are non-Christian, or you know someone his is that doesn't fit the \"stereotype\", and so of course you don't like it.As for the actual movie, I saw it to be a realistic, and yet, surprisingly extraordinary struggle between Christians and non-Christians. Yes, there are people who are suppressed for their faith (don't believe me, look at typical, especially American, politics, e.g. \"Gay Rights\"), and they have a choice to make: to proclaim their faith, to hide their faith, or lose their faith. What makes the film unrealistic is that the protagonist, Josh, stands up against a vengeful college professor. Not many people would do that.This movie is meant to be inspiring to those who want to express their faith, but feel like they can't. It touches the hearts of many people: people with mentally ill parents, people diagnosed with terminate diseases, people that feel that they can't express themselves, and even agnostics. The only aspect of the movie I found \"offensive\" was Professor Radisson's slanderous use of scripture (e.g. Job).Think what you want, and interpret what you want, but overall, this was a great movie. Just remember Matthew 12:32-33, \"Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven.\" (NKJV), and that's written in red, so it means something.Also, for those that think I'm being a Bible thumper, might I suggest one of the most credible sources of the Bible, written by the BROTHER of Jesus Christ, my savior, James. It's after Hebrews but before 1st Peter.For those that also thought the movie was inspirational, pass on the message, \"God's Not Dead\". And he never will be.",

YES, in a way it is. This movie strongly states the message \"If you die and have not accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you will go to HELL\". Is that offensive, yes!!! But, I would rather it offend 1000 people to the point that maybe 10 of them would realize that while you may only live for 100 years on this earth, your soul will live forever SOMEWHERE. Is the movie offensive because \"non-Christians\" are portrayed as jerks; not really. Are there good \"non-Christians\" out there, of course. I was once one of them. Are there non-Christians that are completely \"job goal oriented jerks\"; Yes certainly and I am sure you know a few. Just because the movie takes the liberty to show a few non-Christians as real people that exist in the world, why should you condemn it. The Muslim father in this movie to me is shown as a Loving father the entire time(except for the physical part - I don't want to spoil anything), he is simply a father that wants his daughter to follow in his belief system. If you don't agree with that, you are probably not a father.This is a Christian MOVIE!!! If you don't want to be offended by the Christian message, you may want to watch something else like \"Noah\". Just do me a favor, when you are looking for answers to \"why\" in life, then it is time to pick up a copy.In the past, I had watched a number of \"Christian\" movies that had great plots but were just NOT well written or produced.

Such as, if God is real why do horrible people live such good lives (as outlined by Dean Cain's character); how sometimes the most aggressive anti-theistic people are desperately seeking answers, and sometimes it takes a drastic life altering event to bring them to terms with this.The girlfriend of the main character was a good depiction of people who claim the faith but don't really live the faith.There were a few Luke-warm Christians in this film, so in no way did it depict Christians as being perfect.To the gentleman who said professors and University systems are not like this, I beg to differ. I grew up in a progressive, over the top University town and attended a university. People like the professor in the movie are abundant in towns like this. This movie really reminded me of the town I grew up in. Very unfriendly to people of many faiths. Plus, this movie was inspired by actual events. So think again if you feel this doesn't happen.For the people who were angry about the depiction of the Muslim father, I am so sorry but he is both the exception and the rule. The fact that he held back his anger made him the exception but his response to his daughter is the rule. I've known many Muslims, they are friendly with Christians until their own become Christians. Yes, there are exceptions to the rule but those are far and few in between. And I apologize if my statements offend people but the statistics speak for themselves. However, this is a separate discussion. I feel the movie was just trying to high light what is going on in the Muslim community with the younger generation turning to Christ. This is causing an uproar in largely Muslim nations. Such as Iran, where you are in danger to believe in the Christian faith and can face on the spot execution. In Egypt many years ago, when women converted to Christianity they were raped, beaten and left for dead. This part of the movie wasn't to give out anti-Muslim sentiments but to show the power of faith and how people are willing to risk losing everything to claim to their faith in Christ.If this movie was so horrible, I don't think it would've moved so many to seek Christ and change their lives. As an intellectual, I was left wanting more in the arguments of science and faith. But, I could feel something powerful moving through that theatre. And, it drew an interest in my friend to give his life to Christ when I took him. I told him I felt the movie was lacking. He said no, it was just enough to get people interested and seek more answers and seek the Lord.",

            "content": "I'm going to start off talking about this film objectively, and leave the horrible (and inaccurate) themes of this movie aside for the time being. First off, I have trouble figuring out how this movie made it to theaters. It's acting, editing, directing, score, basically every aspect of the movie, felt like I was watching one of those awful low budget ABC family made for TV movies. Then there were three or four very loosely connected story lines that completely distracted from the main one. One of the had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of them, and served no real purpose, aside from offending Muslims (more on that in a second. Overall, even if I didn't think this movie had an awful message to it, I would say the production quality was absurdly awful for a movie the made it to the big screen, and making 62 million dollars. With the majority of that money coming from Christians that feel they have to like it. Now to the story, and what a story it was. The only people that wouldn't find this movie offensive are Christians, and if you're a good Christian, you should also be offended. How might this movie be offensive to almost all belief systems you ask? Well, the writers seem to think that morality can only be born from Christianity. Every character in the movie who isn't a Christian is evil. There's the fourth story line in this movie, that has absolutely no link to the rest of the movie. It follows a Muslim girl who has been in the closet about being Christian. It exists solely to show that Muslim fathers are all evil and abusive. The movie also shows that atheists are all arrogant, narcissistic tools whose whole life purpose is to ridicule Christians for their beliefs. The professor insults his Girlfriend for being a Christian. He makes people refute their belief in God. This professor cares about nothing more than ruining the main character's life. He even states that he will destroy the main character's chances of getting into law school after he fails to prove the existence of God. The antagonist is a hilariously unrealistic caricature of what idiot Christians think atheists are. Then at the end of the movie, the professor admits to hating God. Showing all Christians that atheist are just faking, and all secretly hate God. Which is one of the most insulting things you can say to an atheist. I don't hate God, I think God doesn't exist because there's no need for a God to exist. Then there are the inaccuracies. The main character uses circular reasoning (after stating how circular reasoning is an error in logic). He quotes outdated theories. He states facts completely incorrectly. For example, he said that the bible is over 2500 years old. So overall, this was a poorly made movie ripe with inaccuracies and expresses the world view of a Christian who plugs their ears whenever someone tries to express an opinion that isn't their won. Finally, what I feel needs to mentioned most. This movie attempts to perpetuate the inaccurate view the Christianity is under attack. Every single Christian in this movies is the underdog. They're surrounded by atheists (or the evil muslims) that will attack their beliefs as often as they can. This view is absurd considering that you can't get elected unless you're a Christian in this country. 7 states even ban atheists in public office. The only type of person who I could imagine liking this is someone who feels obligated to like it because of their faith. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities to it. A rare movie that truly deserves a 1/10.",

            "content": "This movie not only fails to deliver a thoughtful message about Christianity, it fails to be entertaining. There are no characters in this movie, there are only caricatures. Stereotypes are everywhere. Atheists are cold, bitter and eager to force their views on everyone. Muslims lash out in violence when they don't get their way and Christians are thoughtful, caring and fearless in the face of a sea of atheists. This universe where a brave Christian minority must confront hordes of bitter atheists exists only in the fanciful imaginations of some very paranoid Christians. In short this movie and its characters are incredibly simplistic and one dimensional. This movie has no depth and lacks any original content.Any Atheist will find this movie ridiculous because it assumes that there are no atheists, only Christians who are bitter at God. This movie would lead to you to believe that Atheists lead shallow, empty lives. I'm an Atheist and I live a pretty good life. Im just a regular guy with a wife, job, 2 kids and a mortgage. I have my reasons for not being a theist and they have nothing to do with being angry with God. One final thing I have to say. Despite what this movie implies, Christians are the overwhelming majority in this country and assert their will far more easily than any other group but their ranks are slowly shrinking. The number of people who identify as nonreligious are growing. This is because Christianity has become a business with mega churches and pastors making huge salaries. The Christian religion has willingly allowed itself to become a tool used by politicians seeking to gain political leverage. Each year I see the church weave itself more closely into this ugly world of politics. Christs message of love, self sacrifice and compassion doesn't always seem to fit in. This movie is emblematic ofthe problem facing the church. Rather than taking a hard look at themselves and what they are offering potential members, they simply blame Atheists for this cultural shift. This movie wont change any atheists mind but it doesn't aim to. They're not the intended audience. This movie is intended for the pretentious Christian who enjoys feeling morally superior, self righteous and most importantly oppressed.",

            "content": "This movie, god is not dead, through its contorted portrayal of non- Christians, has inspired me to be more vocal in my opposition to religion, in general, and especially to the Christian faith. I am deeply saddened by the positive reviews of such a deplorable film. To say that this film is offensive is an understatement. How can anyone with even an iota of common sense or critical thinking ability support such an abomination? At every turn the viewer is bombarded by harmful negative stereotypes, which other reviewers have already aptly pointed out. All of the contexts are contrived and the arguments are very weak.In what universe do people who enjoy this kind of religious smut live? How can such close-minded, irrational people exist?It reminds me of a Dog psychologist who wrote that people tend to project their thoughts onto their Dogs, to the point that they feel that the Dog understands them and has human-like emotions and actions, when in reality the Dog doesn't even come close to seeing the world the same way that humans do. Dogs, as do other pets, bring comfort to those that keep them. To a lesser degree, this same analysis can be applied to human to human relations. It might be common for you to assume that the person next to you thinks and feels much in the same way that you do. I often make that mistake. After seeing this movie, and the disheartening reviews of those who enjoyed it, I am reminded that this is not the case. There are, in fact, many individuals who have a warped perspective on things. There are people with agendas who malevolently manipulate and there are the ignorant masses that obediently follow.People who are capable of logical, rational thought must not stand idly by. They need to get involved in the fight to bring clarity to the darkness created by this kind of theatrical garbage. I gave this movie a rating of 2, not the 1 it really deserves on any artistic or thought-compelling level, solely because the negative backlash to the extremely bigoted views put forth in the film could actually prove useful in the bigger picture. Yes, this movie is so demented that it could serve as a sort of anti-propaganda; antithetical to the goals of its misguided makers.Some thoughtful Christians have commented negatively on the film. I applaud them for coming forward and speaking out. Those who support it, however, would do well to take a course in critical thinking, and to get out more, so as not to be sheepishly led by the right-wing power structure that preys shamelessly on their ignorance.",

            "content": "Hubby and I saw this movie last night. I don't know why reviewers here are SO afraid of a movie requiring the audience to think; dismissing this as \"religious propaganda\" TOTALLY misses the point that this movies is an honest DEBATE between believers and non-believers. The atheist professor's position is well documented in the film with material from Stephen Hawking, Richard Dawkins, etc., and refuted by current research from theist (Christian) scientists. Honestly, the Hawking-Dawkins-Darwin stuff is old thinking and people today should be MUCH more aware of current science as it pertains to the origin of the Universe and so forth. (For example, see Reason To Believe website, which is run by theist scientists and scholars and welcomes non-believers as well as believers.) One should never base one's faith on science alone, for as the science changes (and science DOES change! Hello-o-o! Which was well-illustrated in the movie!) one's faith can be shaken, but it IS a very good start for exploration and study, and certainly, appropriate for a movie based in a college setting. As for the atheist professor being an unrealistic character, when I went to college there were MORE than a few professors like this, who jealously guarded their personal fiefdoms and targeted colleagues and students they considered oppositional or a threat to their personal positions in their fields of expertise (art, literature, etc.) This is nonsensical in a college atmosphere of open learning, debate and scholarship, of course, but it happens on just about every campus, let's face it. If you have friends or acquaintances who are professors, just ask them!I especially liked that this movie raises the scary question of the existence of evil (cancer, suffering, natural disasters, criminal activity, etc.,) in the world. The movie points out that most people mistakenly think these things are \"acts of God,\" which makes no sense. (He created us just to give us cancer???) God permits evil in a limited capacity because we are here on Earth to choose between good and evil. He created free will. If He refused to allow evil to exist, and only permitted good, how could we know what we are choosing between? How could this be a choice, then?The writing in the movie is very good, the acting if fine (some actors, who you've see before, Dean Cane, Kevin Sorbo, are better than others; I'd have liked a better actor for the lead role, for instance; hence, my 9 out of 10 rating,) the production quality of the movie is excellent. I would have liked to have seen much more science and less romance in the plot. Honestly, hubby and I saw the Johnny Depp film TRANSCENDENCE last weekend, and I'd say the EXACT SAME THING about the writing, acting, plot and production of THAT film - they are directly comparable!Bottom line, this movie encourages thought, exploration, debate and study. Just because it is not currently politically correct, there is no reason to be afraid of it. Heck, COLLEGE encourages thought, exploration, debate and study. You're not afraid of higher learning, are you? And setting this movie in a college environment makes perfect sense.God welcomes everyone, no exceptions. He loves, understands, forgives. This MOVIE welcomes everyone. Take your friends with you and go see it! YOU are important, where you will ultimately spend eternity is important, and any thought you give to your future is time well spent. God bless!",

            "content": "Yikes. This film is portrays Christians as victims while they are prosecuting everyone else. Anyone who isn't Christian (and the right \"kind\" of Christian) is portrayed as the worst stereotypes and as pure evil, whose only purpose in life is to prosecute those \"poor\" pure Christians.None of the characters are allowed to have any humanity or human growth at all.Case in point: Professor Radisson. Radisson claims to be an atheist, when in reality, he is a broken believer who lost his faith over his mother's death. The film portrays him as if he is Satan's highest ranking minion. When he finally comes to peace with himself, he goes to give a well-needed apology to his girlfriend (who was one of his students). He gets hit by a car and is met by probably the two worst people on the planet: Dave and Jude. Do they ask how is he? Do they call 911? No, they preach the Bible to him and says it's his chance to get salvation. The professor confesses, and Dave and Jude rejoice over the now dead professor. Any decent human being, regardless of their faith or non-faith, would probably call for help if not call 911 themselves. No, instead we have two unnecessary characters \"play doctor\" so they could have their egos filled.Speaking of big egos, Josh has a huge ego who cares more about being more holier than thou than anything else. He tricks his girlfriend, convincing her to give up her dreams and then dumps her when he decides debating is more important than his relationship. He uses the personal pain of the professor to \"win the debate\". Looks like compassion, love, and understanding don't exist in Josh's religion.Thankfully in the real world, public universities wouldn't tolerate anyone who demanded that their students follow their faith or fail.There's also hypocrisy. Take how the Christians cry about how everyone else (literally everyone else) pushes their beliefs on them when that's clearly not the case. At the end of the movie, we have the Duck Dynasty dude telling everyone to push Christianity on everyone else. These people love to play both the pusher and the victim at the same time.Don't bother with this film. Not even good portion of Christians in real life agree with this drivel (read the comments and see for yourself ).",

I don't believe the movie creators were trying to portray the message that ALL atheists are like the characters in the movie; however, because strong Christians are a minority, there are atheists out there who will put God down in front of a class full of students. This movie, in my mind, was ideally to help those who are already looking into becoming a Christian, or those (especially teenagers) who are already Christians who need the strength to stay faithful to God. Another thing to be noted - this movie was not meant to be a \"science vs. Christianity\" debate to educate or entertain (although there were very good points given in this movie). This is a movie meant to portray the hardships that different characters in a specific situation had to face; just like any other movie.",

His mother dies so he hates god so much that he uses a homework assignment to get back at god. Again, a very poorly written plot device. I don't understand how exactly the homaphobic racist redneck from duck dynasty ended up involved in this but his exclamation of \"if we give up on him (God) he gives up on us\" is yet another self contradicting Christian blunder of moronic drivel that puts a nice crown on this failure of a film. As an Atheist it all comes as little surprise. Fanatic theological film makers want to paint those who just do not believe in the idea of \"god\" as demons, threaten the audience with eternal hellfire and instead of combating the issue with a more structured plot or at least some argument that would actually be a plausible one, they use baseless devices and outright LIES.",

And if you see this movie, there's more than one situation (the part where Josh refused to fill in \"God is dead\" as instructed by the professor), there's like 4-5 other different scenarios, but all lead to one solution, one answer: that God is real, and that He is not dead, and that He has the power to save.So, if you're living in the UK or other places where God's Not Dead is released on your nearest theater, go invite your friends, buy some tickets for it, grab yourself some popcorn, and go and see this movie.",

There are some cheesy lines and predictable scenes but the movie evokes strong emotions and it moved me. I highly recommend it to evangelical Christians. Some people gave 1 out of 10 stars and say that they were offended, etc. because the gospel is offensive to the world. People do not want to hear that they are sinful and condemned.

In the antagonist role, Sorbo's performance is surprisingly good and, in the personality department, to use a collegiate term, highly persuasive \u2013 and he's not the only 90's TV hero in the mix\u0085 Also on board is SUPERMAN Dean Cain as a jerky businessman who, like the other \"villains\" including a strict Muslim father, is far from Christian\u0085 Especially Cain's girlfriend, an Internet reporter who loathes DUCK DYNASTY and then, after finding out she has cancer, begins to question her own non-belief.While the ending, taking place at a Christian rock band's concert, is corny and predictably propagandist, and Radisson's fate provides a much too easy out (while tying loose ends with a side-character pastor), our two persistent leads \u2013 the Christian student and the Atheist teacher \u2013 make GOD'S NOT DEAD an entertaining debate\u0085 for either side.",

The actors & actresses are very good as well, not a phony act as most would lead you to believe.

I mean that you cannot be good or have morals without being a believer is bogus and offensive. Especially when in this movie you have some of the worst humans as believers. I am an atheist. However, I believe myself to be honest, caring, and most importantly open minded. I find nothing wrong with Christianity and the belief in god. As a matter of fact, many times, I want to believe. However, what I have a problem with is Christian people, like this movie, that are trying to fear me into believe. It is easy to just say I believe, but, who cares about the words, if, it is not true in my heart. I hope there is something more, but, I can't believe without doubt about there being anything when we die. So, this movie had good people that meant well, but, my problem was in how they portrayed the nonbelievers as so evil. It was such a disturbing movie and was so disappointing.

On any week 2-3 movies come out. This is clearly a Christian Movie with a Christian message. So many of these so called reviewers are liars. No way they actually wasted money on seeing this movie with for the most part TV or no name actors. Now for the movie. Acting is good to great for some. The main Character Josh is well done by Shane Harper. Kevin Sorbo is really good. It surprises me that he is not in more movies. Dean Cain does great for his small role. David White is probably the weakest actor on here but he is a likable guy. The problem I have with the movie is there is so much going on. I would have preferred the movie to follow Josh and see more of all the stands he has to make for his faith in everyday situations. While the debate of the movie is the main focus. It is getting attacked because the atheist side is portrayed very weakly. But the story is more about standing up for Christ than about having a debate. If you want to have a debate, watch Ken Ham and Bill Nye. Look many outlets praised Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. How one sided was that. If you want to watch a movie about an underdog who faces lots of pressure to conform to society and refuses too, this is a great movie to watch. This movie made 68 million dollars. Somebody liked it. By the way I am a Minister. Every evangelical I know that saw it praised this movie. They thought it was great. If you see someone on here who claims they are a evangelical minister and hated it, trust me they are not evangelical. If you are mad at production or the feel and look, blame Hollywood. For Christian movies to get made they just don't have the same money behind them. For a movie made for 2 million dollars it had a better story than most of the 100 million budget garbage that comes out.I would have given this higher but Christian films still just don't have the backing to look as crisp as most of the Hollywood movies.",

It doesn't really matter. Logic is a branch of philosophy, but any professor who claims that the \"nonexistence\" of \"God\" is subject to meaningful proof is a professor of something else -- economics, say. \"Something exists such that it is not the case that \"God AND Dead\"\" is not a valid argument. \"Something exists such that it is the case that \"God AND Not Dead\"\" isn't either.

Further, warning of dire consequences if they don't he instructs them to submit a paper with the words \"God is dead\" along with their individual signatures. Josh feels this is wrong and so he refuses. This results in Professor Radisson singling him out and for the benefit of the class he makes Josh give 3 lectures during the semester proving that God does indeed exist. In the meantime, various other people are loosely affected by this debate and the movie branches off to cover their plight as well. At any rate, rather than disclose any more of the movie and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a pretty good Christian film for the most part. Although I enjoyed the performances of both Shane Harper and Kevin Sorbo I have to say that some of the other characters needed more screen time and the ending left me somewhat underwhelmed.

If you substitute Nazi for Christian and Jew for non-Christian in this movie, you have a 1930s Third Reich propaganda film.The acting was decent, especially for a Christian movie. And the utter horridness which is the script is probably a testament to how good the actors actually are. The script was something a backwoods 12-year-old Pentecostal could have penned on a napkin. Stilted, contrived dialogue and so many leaps in logic it is at times unbearable. The most ridiculous leap overall is the fact that while Josh (the main character) attempts to argue for deism, he fails to make a case for theism and doesn't even come close to touching on the proofs for his specific religion, Christianity. The best he does is argue for a generalized organizing intelligence but, even so, makes a terrible argument, full of straw men, bad science and cherry-picked/manipulated data, but this was a Christian film so I wasn't expecting much. And somehow his opponent, the philosophy professor, Professor Radisson, is so terrible a philosophy professor that he spends his time making appeals to authority and appeals to violence, threatening to \"end Josh's career\" - gimme a break - for \"making him look foolish\". But after Josh triumphs in a blaze of glory, getting Radisson to admit that he actually does believe in God but hates him because he gave his mom cancer, we magically jump without explanation from deism to religion-specific theism...Islam? Hinduism? Ahem...no, Christianity. I'm sure the makers of the film will argue that with a limited amount of time they could not make an effective case for why Christianity happens to be the right religion. My answer however is 'tough.' It makes your story look ridiculous to anyone who isn't already in the tank for Christianity. Josh makes his case (using futuristic Hollywood graphics that apparently he had training and software he could run on his Macbook for) for a general deity, but without so much as a half-hearted segue we're all of a sudden talking about Jesus. The Chinese student after listening to this presentation that simply casts doubt on a non-deistic universe (Josh even says during the film that his goal is not to prove to you that there is a god but to assure you \"you don't have to commit intellectual suicide\" by believing in one) says he's going to convert to Christianity. What? Why didn't he convert to Buddhism?So now everyone's going to see the \"Newsboys\" (Christian band) and profess their faith and then of course the Duck Dynasty guys show up talking about Jesus without so much as a peep from how we got from Big Bang to Bloody God-man on a Cross You're Going to Hell. For, now the movie does turn to hell. Spoiler alert; avert your eyes before I ruin for you one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the 21st century; Radisson gets run over by a car. And then a preacher who's spent the bulk of the movie being thwarted by God from going to Disneyland because God keeps killing the motor on his car, shows up not to save his life (even saying, \"His ribs are cracked. He's going to die.\" What? Are you a medical professional? Call this guy a g--damn ambulance!) but to save his soul. \"Is anyone here a doctor!?\" Nope. Instead, the preacher kneels down and convinces this man to regive his life to Christ so that he doesn't go to hell. How cynical. Just unbelievable choice on the part of the filmmakers. That scene really made me sick. The preacher even says in essence, \"I think God is merciful. That is why he killed you when I was around so you could confess to Jesus before you died and not go to hell.\" Wow, just disgusting. If you're indoctrinated into Christianity and don't question its assumptions however, I'm sure you found this scene very moving. Every non-Christian in this film, with the small exception of the bitchy girlfriend, is just an awful awful person. The goal of the filmmakers to denigrate those who don't share their faith while simultaneously propping themselves up as some sort of standard for decent behavior is so unbelievably transparent that if you're not already a Christian I'm sure you find this film insufferably offensive. Like I said: Substitute Christian for Nazi and non-Christian for Jew and you've got a film Hitler would get such a raging boner for it would poke out of the grave.",

It showed how a person who believes in humanism can suddenly find that humans can be evil when faced with a tragedy, but God's love is always there and available if you just seek it!

It's like a trick or an illusion of thought which is very often used to fool people into a certain way of thinking.In regards to the movie \"God's Not Dead\", the Christian's entire argument was based on a Logical Fallacy - The Burden of Proof - which lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove it.It shamefully utilises this manner of thinking to throw down the gauntlet \"Disprove what cannot be proved\", and brushes over this fallacious argument in the hope that the ignorant Christian demographic it is pandering to wont notice it at all.If the 4.8 rating at the time of writing is anything to go by, I guess the majority of viewers identified the retarded logic of this movie, and poured scorn accordingly.This movie was the epitome of Christian propaganda, and a futile effort to prop up the fallacious thinking of so many billions of Christians worldwide.

To everyone whose reading this, give it a chance go see for yourself what this movie is about. Truth is as a college student in California I have faced professors trying to discredit God. I once enrolled in an ethics class where the professor based her class on studying the (idea of a) devil. Studying the devil to learn ethics, it didn't make much sense to me either. I wish I had the courage to stand up boldly for my beliefs but in a secular college the profs really pressure you to get in line. Sure they don't make you sign a piece of paper but some will make sly comments attacking Christianity every other class and if I want a \"top-rate\" education I have to sit through it. That's just the way it is. To succeed in college and follow God sacrifices have to be made; relationships, reputation, sometimes even grades are all put on the line as one tries to stay true to ones beliefs under constant pressure to conform to an increasingly godless society. I'm just glad someone made a movie showing part of life from my perspective. The perspective of a Bible believing Christian. Yes, some parts of the movie are edgy, some are unrealistic but realize this is not a documentary or a non-fiction film. Some parts of it are exaggerated to make a point, at the end of the day it's still just a movie. If you want nothing but the truth and want to learn all about Christ turn to the Bible in it the living God has left all one needs to know.If you already have a set opinion on religion and from the get-go you try to find mistakes with this movie, yes you'll find them.

Jeffrey Radisson, the Philosophy professor, makes an interesting point that many militant atheists are in fact converts from an emotional letdown attributed to theism. The \"why would a supreme being let my mother die in pain?\" confusion, based on the curious idea that such a being, if real, would be more interventionalist, therefore cannot be real. It's a judgement call. The idea comes across that \"I hate God\" implicitly affirms the concept, God, denied by atheism\u2014emotion & creed can conflict: one can of course remain a theist and hate, if not God, at least their concept of God. But how much hate hides under cover of atheism? It also presents well, militant atheism's anti pro-choice credentials, as seeking to out-jeer theism, the \"shame on you\" line of New Atheism. Some good points are given by Josh, not to prove God's existence, but to prove the legitimacy of debate. A number of relational situations are examined: is standing up for unpopular belief justified (Josh Wheaton; Ayisha)? Is it smart for Christian & Anti-Christian to pair up (Jeffrey, Mina)? Is the irony not sad yet understandable that a godly Muslim and loving father (IMO heaven bound) casts out a godly daughter who's become a Christian?My main problems were with some Christian assumptions. Eg, the leader of Newsboys (a Christian group) prays to 'God', descending into the term, 'lord', ending up with the idea that God is Jesus, and that request should be to him. IMO that's antibiblical. I was also disappointed that when Radisson is dying after a hit and run, Dave, a pastor, seems to me to say that God was in the hit, aiming for Radisson to become a Christian in order to gain eternity. That's not my soteriology: I think eternity has a mortal dimension (Christianity) and a postmortem (heaven), the latter not being the exclusive preserve of Christians. I hoped to see another philosopher return to his podium another Justin Martyr: Christianity is the best philosophy. Annoyingly, the Newsboys (probably good people) also speak about their god (I would reject all types of god) and sing that he is alive (if he is life (transcendent), he can neither be alive nor die\u2014both spatial-temporal concepts). Overall, a bit too insular Evangelicalism for my Evangelical comfort, but with some good argument, music, and relational snippets. And free from of lot of the tripe generally served up.",

The story is basically a white, middle-America Christian fiction (cri-fi) fantasy , where one isolated young man of faith (tall, handsome, and white) fights for his beliefs against a tide of non-believers (all selfish, immoral, and greedy), and convincingly wins. In the space of a few days Josh manages to convert an Ark full of Muslims, atheists and agnostics to the one true faith of Christianity. There are also several sub-plots; one including the wacky Christian comedy duo, the reverend Dave (played by David A.R. White \u2013 and he is) and the reverend Jude (played by Benjamin Ochiemin \u2013 he's black), with 'the car that won't start routine'. It's hilarious!So, you can approach this film in two ways: 1. Seriously \u2013 then you're probably going to either love (Christian viewers) or hate (non-Christian viewers) it, or 2. Light-heartedly \u2013 then you're going to find it quite entertaining \u2013 I did. You decide.",

            "content": "Contrary to the review by \"Abarahamic monotheist\" BlackSnowflake, the video is very tame compared to the vile hatred you can expect from the atheist opposite of this film, \"The Unbelievers\" which stars infamous anti-theist Professors Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss as they travel the world publicly lying for atheism.This video is nothing more than an drama film mainly orientated towards a Christian audience and isn't meant to convince people.Blacksnowflake writes \"In addition, the situation with a college professor FORCING his students to write down that God does not exist for THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR GRADE is incredibly unrealistic and again, bigoted\" unaware that similar real events have occurred at colleges, the most notable recent one being at Florida Atlantic University where a professor told students to write Jesus on a piece of paper and trample on it wherein a student was suspended for refusing to do so (\"FAU College Student Who Didn't Want To Stomp On 'Jesus' Runs Afoul of Speech Code\" ~ Forbes). After public exposure and support from other Christians, the University was forced to apologize (and rightfully so) to the student.So the college professor in the movie isn't an inaccurate portrayal as such things have occurred.The atheist argument of God not existing because a bad thing happened to them, commonly enough, is most people's reason for being atheist. It is emotion that drives an atheist, not intellect and this can be seen with how many of them insult God (a being they apparently don't believe in) revealing their spite for him. Later they adopt science into their beliefs (mainly evolution which they think refutes God) to support their assertions that all things can happen uncaused as they completely disregard philosophy, the prime-mover and causality to support their nonsense.Perhaps atheists are taking offense to the college professor in question because they finally see themselves in the mirror as what they really are: angry, spiteful intolerant, bigoted and misogynistic people whose pseudo-scientific disingenuous rants fail to support their atheistic world-view.Atheist idol Dawkins also further reinforces that such atheists exist, if the internet atheists weren't enough to convince you.",

One being Philosophy 150. The clairvoyant guy signing him up immediately spots the cross on his chest in a very sherlock holmesey fashion and warns him about the horrors a choir boy like him might face in the pit of the anti-theistic snake that is the movie's villain.The scene ends with some mockery of the fact that China is a \"people's\" republic and not God's - like America. Pretty random, I know. But it gets much worse.The class starts and the professor introduces it by naming a few atheists and explaining what atheism is. How else could he have introduced it? He continues the lecture with a very profound explanation of Nietzche's notorious quote - \"god is dead\". Apparently it's a metaphor. For god not existing. Like, ever. These writers really are a funny bunch. He then makes everyone write down the famous quote on a piece of paper and sign it. Our hero proudly refuses to deny the all-powerful and says something along the lines of \"f**k off\". Prof totally freaks out, humiliates him in front of the whole class and challenges him to a debate.A lot of other s**t then happens that mostly makes you wanna gouge out your own eyes with a tea-spoon. The characters have no depth and don't evolve at all. They show atheists as extremely insensitive, narcissistic psychopaths without empathy or regard for anything other than their own temporary pleasure. They don't give a f**k. And why would they? No god no morals, right?They also randomly throw in a few very offensive scenes without any storyline, argument or premise whatsoever. A stereotypical muslim father beating the s**t out of his daughter for listening to some christian prayers on her iPod for example. They could have just played an ISIS beheading video instead.In the end the kid wins the argument by forcing the professor to admit that he actually hates god thus showing his anti-theism is in fact just a defense mechanism from a childhood trauma. So there really are no true atheists. There are only sad, pathetic cynics who overcompensate by being bitter and cruel to their loved ones.If you think you are an atheist go to the nearest church and get baptized as soon as worldly possible. Because you're getting run over by a car soon. That or cancer. But by then it will be too late. You are going to be alone in your despair. Crying like a pussy you are. So do the right thing; blast some christian pop and be safe not sorry. That is unless you want to end up in hell. In which case you can just go see this movie.",

When the college professor, played by Kevin Sorbo (Hercules) asks his students to simply write God Is Dead on a piece of paper so they can move on to another chapter in his class only one student says no. The teacher is completely condescending and makes it a point to call the student out at every point because of his faith. In modern colleges, like Harvard, Princeton, etc. this is actually happening today. If you are a Christian you are mocked for being a backward thinker. This film was uplifting because it showed ways to handle atheist thought without compromising your Christian faith. I applaud the actors in the film for a great performance and the director and writers for making it happen despite the fact that main stream Hollywood had nothing to do with this film. Bravo!",

I don't care for some higher cause in this situation. There was a man dying in front of you and you didn't help in any way and you think that there should be a celebration? I would be glad if some devoted Christian can find some line in the Bible that justifies that act.In the same scene a character who's a reverend is trying to force a dying man to accept the Christian God. The reverend is not trying to directly help the person. He's just trying to prove that he is right.For me, this movie was helpful in thinking of Christianity as a good religion.

I respect anyone that does that. I am a Christian and I'm prob the lest judgmental person you well meet.

The Professor makes everyone in his class sign a sheet of paper saying, \"I don't believe in God.\" Josh refuses to sign this sheet and instead is challenged by the professor to prove the existence of God or else the philosophy professor will fail him. This movie is about how Josh goes about proving the existence of God and what the professor learns from Josh. There are other cultures and religions shown and mentioned in this film such as a Muslim family, a Chinese Buddhist family, and many agnostic characters.When picking a film to watch, I was interested by this movie because I wanted to learn more about the debate between God and science, however, this film wasn't what I thought it would be about. This movie wasn't as great as it focused more on how being a Christian affected the individuals family life rather than the debate between God and science. An example is how a Muslim girl became Christian and was disowned by her father. At the end of the story, Josh somehow proves the existence of God, however, it isn't really clear how he does so. At the end, all the characters meet up at a Newsboys rock concert and you find out that the professor dies. This whole movie was extremely confusing and only contained partial religious content.

The premise was intriguing--Professor of Philosophy (Kevin Sorbo) hates religion (later we find he hates God too), strong arms his students into denying God, but one student holds out. There's drama around this but the main themes are a debate between the hold out student and the professor; the risks taken by the student; and the professor's reasons for being against religion. In the beginning the movie promised more than it delivered (for me). In our society today there is a perhaps divisive debate between the Atheists and the Theists; this is backdrop. The Atheist position is treated quite unfairly: it is not given much of a chance to develop; the Theist position is done better but still many of its arguments are old ones that have been shown in error. The movie does not bring out very well that the place of religion is an exploration of the gaps left by science. Still, if you are interested in the issues, I recommend it for the not so bad argumentation and the not so ill developed emotional aspects of religion are at least food for thought. The movie flowed well and did not bore me despite the my criticisms. It makes a case for another movie that develops the same themes better.",

(see: thou shalt not covet and ye shall not suffer a witch to live) In addition the tedious protagonist being showed as the \"liberator\" of thought is a laughable given that BELIEF IS THE DENIAL OF OBSERVATION SO THAT FAITH CAN BE RESTORED. (Observation in this case meaning evidence) This might be bias given that I am an atheist but the undeniable bias and bigotry in this film is overt and sickening.

It is a huge surprise a pleasure in this day and age to find a movie with the insight shown in this one.The movie is also accurate in its portrayal of atheist professors. It has been well documented that philosophical and scientific professors especially enjoy undermining the faith of their students. These professions attract atheists who use their position of authority to destroy the religious beliefs of their students.A lot of \"Christians\" are writing in their reviews that they found the film offensive because it surmises atheists are dishonest, or know the truth but are unwilling to face it. I would say to those people; if it were possible to be a perfectly honest atheist, then God would be in the wrong to favour believers before them. So is God wrong, or is the atheist less than willing to face the truth? The fact is, as evidenced by atheists all over the internet and even in the higher echelons of philosophical debate, atheists are dishonest and more often than not, downright nasty. This movie portrays atheism and its promulgation very accurately.The sound track is a little cheesy. Frankly, the movie is a little cheesy, but it is heartwarming, honest, and an antidote to all of the culture poison we are force-fed by the regular media and Hollywood.

Josh Wheaton was a brave young Christian boy who takes up the challenge to prove to his class that God's Not Dead. I believe that is the bravest thing I've ever seen a movie character do. Ayisha is a soft and gentle girl who becomes Christian in the middle of her Muslim family. I believe that too is also amazingly brave. I think it's a wonderful movie and recommend it to anyone.Your life will be changed and you will be brought closer to God. Because as the Newsboys say \"MY GOD'S NOT DEAD HE'S SURELY ALIVE. HE'S LIVING ON THE INSIDE ROARING LIKE A LION!\" He is my savior, my father, and my God. I love him and I trust in him. AMEN!",

            "content": "After watching this movie I thought wow how can this not reach someone? I use to be a Christian but after I got back to the states and returned to the civilian world after a career in the marines corps infantry as a 0352 it was hard adjusting and even harder forgetting. I usually drank but now that I didn't have anyone I began to drink even more. It became so bad that I would drink a bottle of whiskey at night and even while at work I was drinking it became the only way I could cope with life the only thing that made it enjoyable. And yeah I would go to church but that was just to keep my family off my case and assure everyone that I was fine. Some times the word would really minister to me and other times I would think been there read that I felt like there wasn't anything new with this because I've known the bible since I can remember my parents are pastors you see. So after many years of fighting God and living life all wrong this is my most current update of my life. I watched this movie and I thought wow! And for all those people saying these are just stereotypes of Muslims and everything unless you've known really known a true Muslim you know nothing you just have an opinion. Just like an atheist would become angry if their child believed in Christianity fully and whole heartedly, or if a Christians child was a devil worshiper or an atheist they would probably all have the same or a similar reaction as the dad. Also for the characters in the movie who weren't Christian and everyone says the movie depicts them like bad well your wrong too because I've been part of the world and I know the world yeah there are good people but the point is they will always think of whats best for them and will always be selfish some way. Yeah you may be mad at these Christians but why? If it's just a movie and it isn't that good or it's so terrible then why waste your time to write a review? Or perhaps it isn't that at all maybe it's that this movie is so amazing and so honest that you don't want anyone to hear it's good news which is why you have to disprove it. To me this movie was amazing. I laughed I cried I will definitely buy it when it comes out. In the movie it shows different sides of God the One True King that when you watch it you will either be mesmerized or you will be angry because you don't understand it and you don't want it to be true. The movie is about truth not fiction and for all of you that say you don't mind Christianity well apparently you do! I know atheists and just as all of you say about Christians are all the same well so are you. Science gets it wrong all the time just as the movie said whereas the bible had it right all along. This reminds me of a quote by C.S. Lewis he said, \"Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It's like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can't trust my own thinking, of course I can't trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.\" So this is what I think of the movie, and this is what I think of the ignorant hateful reviews towards this movie. They are the ones that are biased and using smart words with a little truth wrapped in a lie to fool everyone. But I say how about you be the judge? You watch it and you decide as for me it was amazing.",

            "content": "While I do appreciate what this film tried to achieve, it failed miserably because of poor expression and inaccurate portrayal. Definitely a missed opportunity and a lost potential.In simple words, the movie is very bad. The acting is terrible. The script is weak. The sound score is messy and annoying, it's all over the place. The details of which many are somewhat inaccurate. And worst of all, the film itself is a piece of misunderstood Christian propaganda, most likely by the dumbing down of Americans. I felt like this movie was an insult to Christians, Muslims, and Atheists alike. Quite ignorant, ridiculous, and naive if you ask me. Spreads confusion than light.Most of all, I did not appreciate the negative and inaccurate portrayal of Islam in this film. Typical. How about I quickly run down through a few known facts that this movie missed?~ The Head Scarf - This is one of the biggest misconceptions around the internet and western understanding. The headscarf, also known as hijab/mandeel, is NOT forced onto women of the faith, nor do their spouses or fathers have any say in the matter. Just as Jewish women and Christian Nuns wear them also, so do women of Islam, for God only, not for anyone else. It is an independent choice that the women commit to, out of love and respect to God. Any exceptions or anything contrary to this, would be solely political or cultural gain. Leave the religion(s) out of this.~ The Apostate - This is another questionable one, as it is moving backwards. For a Muslim to convert to Christianity, is as backwards as a Christian converting to Judaism. It is degrading, literally, as you go from the final build, to the previous beta, to the to the first alpha. Keep in mind that while the Torah is known for being the Old Testament, and the Gospel/Bible being the new testament, the Quran is known and considered to be the Final Testament, of the Abrahamic Faith.~ The 'Other' Religion - Though the words 'Islam' and 'Muslim' have been avoided in the film, they're strongly implied and pointed towards. Not to mention, the portrayal of this faith under a negative and ignorant perspective. Let's make something clear for those who don't know any better, shall we? In the Abrahamic Faith all the prophets of God, starting from Adam and ending with Muhammad, are considered MUSLIMS. By definition, 'ISLAM' literally translates to 'SUBMISSION.' And the word 'Muslim' literally translates to 'The Submitted' (to God that is). As such, we know from the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran that all the prophets submitted themselves to God as they all prayed to Him and were his most loyal servants and messengers.I think this will do from me, I'm sure others have a lot more to say.",

When the movie began you could have heard a pin drop in the filled-to-capacity theater. The actors were great, it was easy to follow, and the message was awesome! We laughed, we cried, and we even applauded. What struck me the most was there were children, teenagers, middle-aged folks and grandparents there, and all of us left with a smile on our face. As we walked out, there was already a big crowd there to see the next showing, and that made my heart smile!

            "content": "If you're expecting a cheaply made, corny Christian movie with bad acting and an unrealistic plot line, then this is the movie for you. Josh Wheaton is attending University and takes a Philosophy class with Professor Radisson, who is supposed to be an Atheist. (We later find out he's just a Christian who's mad at God.) Radisson forces the students in his class to write down the sentence, \"God is Dead,\" and sign it for an assignment. (Totally realistic, right?) Josh refuses because he's a Christian (and apparently no one else out of a class of forty-fifty other students is a Christian.) Radisson tells Josh that he either writes the sentence or tries to prove the existence of God during class. Well, he chooses to try to prove that God is real and I guess ends up winning the debate since his professor got hit by a car and was killed. Between all this happening, Josh's girlfriend breaks up with him (I still have yet to understand the reason as to why) and there are multiple subplots in between that really shouldn't have been there. There's the liberal journalist who has an \"I love evolution\" sticker on the back of her car. (Really? Really?) Who gets diagnosed with cancer later on in the movie. A sociopathic businessman who is probably the biggest jerk on the planet. (Also implied to be an Atheist) A Muslim girl who is abused and thrown out of her house for listening to the Bible on her iPod, the Christian girlfriend of Professor Radisson who has to stand up to her boyfriend's harassment while taking care of her mother with Dementia. (The girlfriend is also the sister of the businessman). Personally, the movie would have been better with the subplots if the filmmakers actually ended them with the main plot. You never know what happens to the journalist with cancer, or the businessman. You never know if the Muslim girl ever gets to go home or not, and you never know how the students or the girlfriend react to Radisson's death. The movie ends with nearly all the main characters at a concert for a Christian band, who sings a song with the same title as the movie, then that's it. I'm giving it a 4 rating total and I feel like I'm being to generous for doing that. It's mostly for the effort. If you're the type of Christian that doesn't believe in Evolution, believes in the Muslim stereotype, and that Atheists are just upset at God, then you might like this movie. If you aren't that type of Christian, then you'll probably just end up being offended and I recommend you save your money and go see a worthwhile Christian movie that doesn't try to press stereotypes.",

            "content": "I am ashamed that there are so many poor reviews either by Christians who have a weak faith in Christ or to those who do not believe. The Truth came out in this movie that answers the question of non-believers 'Why would such a God allow evil things to happen in the world we live in?' The freedom of free will. Otherwise we would be like robots living in a world free of hurt and pain. We all as humans have free will to make choices that we are responsible for, and some make poor choices, and since sin is in our world, we have issues like cancer, aids, disease. However, I challenge any atheist or non-believer to prove that God Almighty does not exist and that He is dead. In your efforts and research to disprove such a concept, you too will come to the Scriptures of the Bible, Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth, that there is a God who loves His creation beyond what the human mind can comprehend. Yes, I am a Christian and I am not ashamed to be persecuted for choosing to believe the Truth. There are so many things in the Bible I may not understand, but know I will see my Creator Face to face in the near future. I know what my spirit tells me, that there is a God who loves His creation, He sent His Son Jesus Christ to fulfill His Law and pay the penalty for the sins of humanity, but the choice remains with each individual to choose to believe or deny His existence. I know God is God the Father, the Son, & the Holy Spirit, and when I read the scriptures, my spirit knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that God is Alive and that I need a Savior.

Another thing that makes my blood boil is that it \"teaches\" a lesson that says that without god you are a complete disgrace for the human species and have will and hope to live and that everything you have done in life was for nothing. I also wanted to point out was that at the end of the movie, the atheist teacher (played by Kevin Sorbo) says that the only reason he hated god was because he blamed god for the death of her mother and tries to imply that,thats the reason people become atheists.This movie overall is just terrible and offensive the only thing this movie is worth of is to see it with some friends and take a laugh at the amazing performance my Kevin Sorbo which other than that makes it an \"avoid at all costs\" type of movie.",

However, as a born again, spirit-filled believer and youth pastor, I thought the film was great! Granted, maybe their were some unrealistic plots and stereo-typical characters, but overall...a decent film. For example, maybe a college professor would never ask a student to write \"God's Not Dead\" but there are professors out there that are challenging a students faith and who criticized student's because of their faith. Reality is that in today's society where public schools teach our students about every religion but shone \"Jesus\", praying in schools, and/or reading a Bible, it was nice to see film that shows the courage of one student who is willing to stand up for what he believes in, even if it could cost him his grade, his future in law school, and/or his popularity. David vs. Goliath! The film showed the struggles of people come to know Jesus but were raised in homes that are based on a different religion and how one person can make a difference in life. Many students in this generation feel insignificant and don't see how they can make a difference; but they can! The movie showed how things will come against you when you stand up for what you believe in, such as loosing your girlfriend, risking your college career, being disowned, etc. Again, could the film have done a better job with some of these characters and plots, sure; but it was still an eye opening and uplifting film. In life people think God is this cruel god who makes people sick, poor, or takes their life, but they never stop to think that there is a devil or that we sometimes we bring on our own destruction. I love the end of the film where Dean Cains mother explains how sin is like a prison. It was such a great analogy. Overall, yes there were parts that I would change! I think they made the Pastor look weak and they could have thrown in some more believers or nice people who didn't believe in God, but overall...it was a great movie. I know our youth group was encouraged to know that they could make a difference, even if it was for one person. It encouraged them to know that it's okay to stand up for what they believe in, even if it costs them friends or popularity. And again, let's be real...it was a clean, wholesome movie that showed people standing up for what they believed in and changing lives....it's way better then a movie filled with sex, cheating, lying, killing, and cussing! The fact is, the last scene is real but many don't believe that Jesus is the only way to heaven. So when the professor gets hit by the car and the Pastor gives him a last chance to accept Jesus...well, it was just showing what we as Christians believe. So yes, many are going to hate this film and rip it apart with criticism, but Jesus told us \"people will hate you because you follow me\" Matt. 10:22. Overall, I would recommend this film!",

            "content": "So, most of the reviews on this movie are all really, really bad. I took a different approach to the movie. Here's what I think.This movie gave a really good portrayal about the persecuted church and christians. I don't think it was a movie that was suppose to make you feel good when you left, but it was a movie that was there to actually show what Christians go through, as well as to prove the case for Christ. Let's look at each character: The Atheist Professor: He was one of the main characters. He was specifically used to show the opposite end of Christian faith. He was also used to show a good deal about Atheism. Yes, he did become an atheist because he felt God took his mother away. I thought this was GREAT because many people who don't believe in God don't because they don't believe that a good God can allow bad things to happen. I loved that they addressed this specific issue.The Muslim Family: So a lot of people are upset because they said that this dad was just used as an abuser, which I don't agree with. If he was just an abuser he would not have been crying over the fact that he threw his daughter out of the house. I really think he was used as an example to other's who struggle in their own faith. He showed how hard it was to abide by a Muslim culture / belief when he threw his daughter of the house for her Christian faith. Josh: Josh was the primary character and he was used to show the persecuted Christian. I could really relate to him, because when I was in High School I was in a class that was extremely similar to this one. I was persecuted for my faith by the teacher. I felt like I would fail the course if I abided by his rules and regulations for papers and assignments, because I didn't believe in his belief system. SO many christians in America and elsewhere are getting persecuted for believing in Jesus. Josh was used to show how this feels, the internal struggle we deal with, the crisis of faith we experience, and different ways we can stand up for Christ.The mean brother: Yeah, yeah, he was a jerk in the movie, but for good reason. How many of us know someone who doesn't need Jesus because they have everything they could ever want? Most of us? He filled this role well. In America most of us don't need God because we have our cars, our clothes, our stores, our jobs, our relationships, and church is just another thing we pass on the roads while we're driving. God is just another things to have, but something we don't really need. I struggle with this. I have so much that sometimes it gets in the way of relying completely on God. I thought that this role needed to be in the movie, because it's constantly around us in other people and in our American culture.I won't go into all the other roles, but I loved the variety. I loved that each person had a different struggle and a different crisis of faith that they needed to overcome. It was important to show this variety, because each role could speak to a different person watching the film. Great movie. I encourage people to watch it with an open mindset =)",

            "content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I am an atheist. Despite that, I watched this film in a theatre for two reason: 1: I wanted to pass judgement on this film, but doing so without having seen the film is disingenuous and 2: I enjoy films on the big screen more than on a TV, regardless of its content. I'll spare the reader any hyperbole resulting from my philosophical differences with the film, and concentrate solely on the qualities of the film (and any film) that determine its overall qualities: plot, in-context believability, character depth, filming/editing style and dialogue. Plot: Do you recall getting the chain email about a marine taking a college class taught by an atheist professor who states that if there is a god, prove himself by striking the professor down within 15 minutes (and at the 14 minute mark the marine stands up and assaults the professor and says something to the effect of \"god was busy protecting your right to say stupid stuff, so he sent me\")? That's pretty much the plot of this movie: a 112 minute extension of that chain email, with a few tweaks, like replacing the marine with a clean-cut Christian who sets out to prove his professor wrong. Also, for no apparent reason, one of the Robertsons (of Duck Dynasty) also appears twice, and in no way moves the plot forward. In-context believability: since the film styles itself as a real-life drama, that is its context. No professor would actually require his students to sign a \"god is dead\" pledge, and spend weeks dealing with someone who disagrees, all at the expense of the actual course curriculum. Also, no reporter would just walk up to Willie Robertson and accost him for selling hunting gear (this part was added in just to give Willie some screen time). Character Depth: This is the worst aspect of the movie. All of the non-christians are presented as evil, scummy and wholly unlikeable, while the christians are faultless angels. Also, the main \"antagonist\" (the atheist professor) isn't really even an atheist, but is simply a former Christian who is mad that god let his mother die. Since he hates god, he must necessarily believe that such a god exists, and is thus not an atheist (more of a straw-man). On the plus side, the only character who lives up to his generalization is the overbearing Muslim father. While not all muslims are misogynistic control freaks, its pretty clear (in the Koran) that Islam doesn't think much of women or their freedoms and rights, and that is how most Muslim households in the middle east operate. Nonetheless, all the characters are 1-dimensional. Filming/editing style: while not as horrible as an Ed Wood flick, its certainly no Kubrick. Dialogue: This ties with character depth as the worst aspect of the movie. It seems as though the screenwriter simply copied and pasted tweets and internet postings to supply the christians' dialogue, and took his straw-man understanding of atheists to supply their dialogue. This film could've been improved dramatically if the screenwriter, director, or somebody on the set simply found an atheist on the street, showed him the professor's dialogue and asked if this was realistic (to which he'd say \"no\" and hopefully provide some constructive criticism. I honestly didn't find this movie abhorrent simply because I'm an atheist (I also watched Heaven is for Real, which wasn't so bad, and I watched Religulous, which was simply an hour and a half rant, and I was not impressed). I found it abhorrent as a film enthusiast. It made the D'Souza \"documentary\" America look like Citizen Kane by comparison.",

I say that because many of you seem to be offended. Many of you believe that the director or whomever tried to portray people who aren't Christian's as idiots. I didn't see that at all. All that was being said is that you have two choices. God or Satan. No where did anyone ever say that non-Christian's are idiots as some of you are implying in your reviews. God is not a debate. Nor do I want to debate Him. I just wanted to write how good this movie was and how I see things. What was shown in this movie are things that actually happen. Many get persecuted for their faith. Get kicked out of homes. ARE angry with God because something terrible happen. Many people who think that smarts is all they need. There are many wealthy individuals who believe that the life they live is perfect and that they don't need God. Of course, there are also people who aren't wealthy who think this way as well. In this case though, I'm talking about what the movie was showing. Because apparently many believe that those situations don't occur. It's so real that even the Bible speaks about all these different examples that happen in the movie. I one hundred percent love what was being said. I love the examples that were given. It was amazing. I think science is great. -BUT- you cannot reason God. You cannot compare God's sovereignty to science. I wish I could give this movie more then 10 stars.

Before I did so, I thought I'd better check out the movie online first. After reading the reviews on IMDb, and how negative they were, I decided not to invite my friends, but to go see the movie myself. Having just seen the movie, I am sorry I did not invite my friends along. The movie was fine, and worthwhile. In fact, I enjoyed it. It's interesting to me how many reviewers proclaiming themselves to be \"Christians\" say they were \"offended\" by this movie. It's a Christian movie written and directed by Christians addressing some of today's contemporary attitudes about God and Christianity...and it's pro-Christian. And the fact it's \"pro-Christian\" and biased as such surprises people??? Really? Why can't some Christians make a pro-Christian movie that un-ashamedly promotes the idea of Christianity? One reviewer called it \"propaganda\". Goodness! Likely 95% of what Hollywood produces is \"propaganda\" promoting a secular perspective and agenda. The content and perspective of these movies are often extremely negative, cynical and depressing in nature. One doesn't get \"offended\" by that for some reason. But Christians producing a Christian movie promoting the idea of God and Christianity is offensive. Wow! The often horrible, meaningless crap we're fed by the entertainment industry we enjoy and consume without offense. Why, then, does a positive, encouraging movie like \"God's Not Dead\" evoke such a reaction and backlash? For me, it was a good piece of entertainment. I felt encouraged by it. And it addressed some perspectives and challenges Christians, and non-Christians, face in life. I wasn't expecting an academy award winning movie, nor a deeply intellectual exploration of Christian apologetics countered by a balanced and equally effective anti-God perspective that would leave the viewer wondering what they should believe. I was expecting to be encouraged and entertained as a Christian. I was.",

This movie should be shown in all schools and colleges around the world. For those who believe it bashed atheism and was one sided, well I say it is about time we had a movie out there that was one sided and that was on the side of a God who loves us, created us and has allowed us to have free will, even the will to chose against loving and obeying him, and ultimately that is what the movie's message is. Freedom of choice which we in the Western World claim to uphold a person's freedom to choose whether or not they want to believe in God. The plot brings this out in all of the cases. For those who hated the movie, it is ultimately because somewhere inside of you, the truth that there is truly a God who loves you and is waiting to forgive you and welcome you back into his fold touched you on some level.

People don't like God or others and you base your reviews on this. The simplicity of the plot gets the point across that Nietszche was wrong when he said \"God is dead.\" God is not dead; he is alive. For Christians, what this young man does is necessary. Perhaps, it seems simple but it is in that simplicity that we see the truth. No matter what, God wants his message delivered. The movie points out the struggles of both the seasoned believer and the new Christian. In the film, the actors do a wonderful job. Not only is it well acted, but it is also well paced and written.",

I found it provided a refreshing alternative to the usual movies that just take evolution as a fact. This movie provided an expression of both the Atheist's AND the Chrstian's arguments. Anyone has to admit that both sides had strong arguments and that it took tremendous courage for Josh to stand up against his rather nasty professor. This movie provided a voice for the hundreds (if not thousands) of students that have been discriminated against at university for their belief in God and Jesus of the Bible. You can't deny that it doesn't happen. The long list of names at the end of the movie are proof of it.",

THE ROOM has long been the go-to classic for this most extreme form of cinematic myopia. GOD'S NOT DEAD, however, goes much farther in its transgressions. Tasteless, insulting, vile movies are a dime a dozen ... GOD'S NOT DEAD combines all those qualities with unbridled earnestness, creating a viewing experience that will assuredly remain encamped in your mind for years to come.I promise that you have never seen a movie as unintentionally funny as GOD'S NOT DEAD. I don't think it will become a cult classic like THE ROOM because its humor is not so strange and it's not nearly as quotable. It's more of the eye-rolling, \"I can't believe people are taking this seriously,\" kind of funny, and the insanity builds to a crescendo of an ending that is shockingly hilarious. I believe GOD'S NOT DEAD will be remembered as a 21st century cultural touchstone. There is no movie that better encapsulates the debasement, decay and imminent collapse of our society's traditional institutions.",

This was an attempt to show that God still changes lives. I think many are missing the big picture here. Josh said it towards the end of the movie. It's a choice. A choice to believe or not to believe. In john 3:16 it says that. For God so loved the world that He gave his only son that whoso ever believes in Him should not perish,but have everlasting life. It is a gift. It is given freely. It is a choice.",

            "content": "This film shows how the Creator is watching is through the lens of a camera, healing our pains and depths of despair through our worst cases of our lives, He is still orchestrating and syncronizing our lives, organizing our chaos into order and helping us become confident and indidualistic people, free from abuse and humiliation, and able to stand up and face our battles despite servere obstacles in our daily struggles. It is not a racist or sexist film, it might show extreme cases, but it may happen to somebody in this BIG universe, from someone getting bullied in a university for standing up for their belilefs, to their lopver wanting to leave them because they are sacrificing their law career or professor's likes or displies, or grades for their beliefs, to one who wants love, but gets humiliated by their forbidden lovers, to someone with cancer, to one who has dementia, to one who is mean made by the corporate world and cannot find themselves, to someone who cannot start their car, and another who is auditioning for a job. These may seem extreme in the movie, but it may happen to people in this BIG universe, and just because it is extreme with someone getting rejected by their family because of beliefs, doesn't make it racist. It makes it easier to relate in knowing how to deal with pain and overcome it through the help of a Creator and almighty God. Pastor, if you hate this movie because it is not subtle enough, then you need to question your job of why you're a pastor. If you tell an athlete to be subtle for their skills, aren't you telling them to shed its talents and keep it hidden, like hide it under a bushel, no, gotta let it shine. Let the movie shine for itself for the eternal life it will give to people in knowing how to deal with pain in the worst situation. Just because they use one race of people to portray it doesn't mean it makes their race look bad, other races with let's say a buddhist background where their family disowned that child and tell them to live outside in an apartment may relate to Alisha and her willingness to stand up for herself and be free from abuse and have a new start in the Creator in finding a path for herself. You see, all these people are arising out of the pain and getting stronger through the Creator, like the girl who is done with all the humilation from her forbidden professor lover and the girl who is getting banished from her family to the guy from China whose searching for God, but they are better for being independent, away from their families and their lovers to find themselves and their place in this world...Thus, i think it is an excellent movie. This film shows God reaching out to humanity through our daily lives, struggles beyond the naked eye can see ,even to the girl whose car got broken into and GPS stolen and the death of the professor, who still has hope even though he died because he received God. Thus, this film is like \"Grand Canyon\" showing reality and the Creator shaping us through our daily struggles. You and I may go through a divorce, leaving home, bullies, getting a good grade, getting a good career, going through a deadly illness, but there is still a Creator that is there healing us and helping us find our paths in this BIG world. I relate to this film very much and have gone through these personal struggles myself, so these cases are not extreme or racist or sexist. It doesn't even matter the color or race of the actors or actresses, or the directors pick of them, it just the theme and the overall topic of this film that matters the most....",

As a Catholic, I was disappointed with the mainstream \"sola scriptura\" theme. But, I expected that. It also belongs in a different review. The script could definitely use some improvement. The story was pretty good. It just needed some tweaks. Fairly believable. But if the movie is intended to evangelize or plant a seed, it likely fails. In the first place, it probably only appeals to believers. If, by some chance, atheists or agnostics or non- Christians happen to see it, it is just too superficial and unrealistic. One thing that bothers me...the Muslim father. Many of the reviews claim he was portrayed as abusive and controlling. I didn't see that in him at all. I saw a man who believes strongly in and loves his faith. He also loves his daughter. *Possible SPOILER...*. His heart is broken when his beloved daughter chooses a foreign life. Bye is overcome with a passionate and bitter grief. He stays true to his faith and puts his daughter out of the house. As they look at each other, he takes her face in his, and it is impossible to not see the agony in his face for doing what he has to do. *End SPOILER* He loves his daughter but loves God more...(a difficult but common theme in religion. Try the first commandment). Not abusive. Those who have never been angry with grief might see it that way. So, the movie missed their mark. But it wasn't bad and it cold lay down the gravel for the path to be paved. Even Christ fell. He got back up and continued on.",

If it is a really democratic space I'd like to post my point of view as a person who enjoys cinema and free speech.Artistic expression has to do with one's soul. It has nothing to do with audience's acceptance (if we limit the audience of this movie to the ones who disapproved this movie in a way or in another).If one watches a Tarantino's movie, he knows he will see a lot of violence, blood and bad language.I guarantee whenever someone watches gospel movies, it hardly come as a surprise that he see a lot of gospel message. Is really fair to call it propaganda?Who can state a sentence in daily life without supporting his/her beliefs or point of views? Genuine Christians are known for spreading the gospel (the good news)as a mission. Of course they do the same in a movie, if they are really Christians. For what reason they would be sponsoring a film? To become famous or be claimed as idols? Their ambitions seem to be a \"little\" different from that... They have a purpose. They want to present everybody a living God of love and the eternal life, which can only be achieved by one Saviour: Jesus. That is their message. That is their movies. For some people, that is also their real lives.This movie was clearly not thought to please everybody. Otherwise, it would not have a clear identity. Maybe, just like the Bible...PS: Christians believe in the Bible. James 1:27. They do not follow a religion.",

            "content": "There is so wrong with this movie, so many cringe-worthy moments from the start to the finish, that I had to pause it and it took me almost 8 hours until I finally managed to finish this atrocity that's labeled as movie - and a movie that had a theatrical release nevertheless. That should be illegal in my opinion.First and foremost, let me say that I have nothing against Christians and Christianity as a community at all. Everybody deserves to believe and worship (or not) what they want, and pushing your ideas down someone else's throat is very unethical and straight up disrespectful.You probably know that this movie is about a philosophy student who refuses to sign at the request of his professor that \"God's Dead\" on the first day of class, and the professor tells him that in the next three weeks he will have 20 minutes at the end of every class to defend his thesis that \"God's Not Dead\".And it is as horrible as it sounds.One thing that bothered me in particular is the fact that they managed to represent an African, a Middle-Eastern, a Chinese and all of them were either existing Christians or converted by the end of the movie.The Muslims are represented in an awful and ugly light which is very misleading and not the reality at all. As a gay man, I've been more accepted and felt more at home when I come out to Muslims than when I do to Christians, because they don't judge as harsh. Yet, here Ayisha's father went bull crazy when he discovered his daughter listening to Christian podcasts, and dragged her outside and kicked her out of the house. The Muslims don't deny the existence of Jesus or have anything against Christianity or Christians at all. Also, the men don't force the women to wear hijabs or burkas either. That's totally up to the woman and I have plenty of Muslim girl friends who don't wear them, and they come from very traditional families.The second thing that bothered me is that every person who doesn't believe in Jesus is automatically presented like the villain and the bad guy, like the philosophy professor and his intellectual friends, and all the Christians are represented as martyrs and the under-dogs, which is not my experience with Christians at all. They are usually the rudest and the loudest people and they always try to enforce their opinion on other people, yet the atheists are presented like this in this one, even though atheist don't believe in god and therefore why would they spend time debating something that according to them doesn't exist, yet alone spend hours of their time to convince others that god never was to begin with?And they way that old lady towards the end told her son that just because he has trouble free life it's from the devil so he can comfortably live in sin - that was just plain ridiculous and it made me laugh almost as much as the claim by the philosophy student that morality can't exist without god and that only Christians have the right moral compass.Overall, this movie was bad from start to finish, a pure propaganda by Christians and people who are so brainwashed that they can't look sideways and see someone else's point of view. The acting is horrible, the editing is okay, but the plot is completely non-existent. I would never recommend this to anyone, and I'm glad I watched it on Netflix because I would never have paid money for this bull.",

People complained about the movie being stereotype regarding certain groups of people (atheist, Muslims, non-believers); but it really wasn't. You have to understand they had to bring out the worst of these characters in order for the viewer to see the difference between someone who has a true relationship with Jesus and someone who doesn't. Some reviewers said that atheist don't hate God just don't believe He exists, well that being said, the Word of God says if you are not with God you are against Him. In other words, good or evil, black or white, hot or cold, there's no in between. Now the movie is not indicating that all atheist act the same way as this character did in the movie, or that all Muslims are abusive or all non-believers are cold heard jerks, but there are a lot of people that are the same as these characters or in there same situation. Google student's being persecuted by schools because of their faith, or what former Muslims have gone through for converting into Christianity. Google persecuting because of Jesus and you'll see that these things do happen, again, not all circumstances are the same, but many are happening. The purposed of this movie is not to offend anyone, but to show how we as the body of Christ are also being persecuted in America and not just these other foreign countries; and we should stand up for our faith against everyone or anything. I believe that if you are a Christian who doesn't tolerate the Word of God being compromised, then you will enjoy this movie. GOD'S NOT DEAD!!!",

Having watched the film -- and thousands of others, some of which perhaps deserve one or two stars -- I find the reviews were written, for the most part, by people who disliked the message. Before watching films these days, I usually look at the IMDb ratings. They are reliable, except when there is a political or social issue -- then people trot out their bias and vote accordingly.As a film, this is no crowning achievement. Some Christians will love it, but the characters are a bit one-dimensional, the events a bit contrived, and the minor miracles probably not likely to convince most people. Atheists, of course -- and they are in great abundance in our age of scientism -- will hate the film. Count on them to vote it down.Having said all that, I thought it was both entertaining and educational. My ten-year- old son chose it and after seeing the 5.0 IMDb score, I told him we could watch it, but if it wasn't good, we would do something else. We watched it to the end.Some critics have criticized the treatment of one highly religious Muslim father for slapping his daughter for secretly becoming Christian and throwing her out of the house. It happens that today I watched a video of a mentally ill Afghan woman being beaten to death for setting fire to a Koran -- and a Muslim cleric saying this was proper if she had left Islam. The purpose of the film is not to condemn Muslims. It is to show that some people come to Jesus and stay, and some do not.For those with open minds, it is worth watching.",

The students didn't say what religion they were either most simply signed to move on with their lives, not thinking into depth anything of it just like josh's Girlfriend she just didn't want problems with her school year, which is understandable. That she acted like a selfish person with her long term boyfriend is another story but we are talking about religion not relationships.Most Muslims especially men if they find out a family member has switched religion will act like the father in the movie that's a fact. Recently in the news it was seen check it out:http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/07/24/pope-francis-meets-sudanese- woman-who-escaped-death-sentence-for-marrying-Christian-man/ This woman was lucky many are not. This whole movie was based on actual events that did happened at a school. Just read the Wikipedia of this film and you'll see =). I think it was really realistic made good arguments in proving the existence of god and Im sorry if people feel offended they shouldn't because regardless in what religion you believe in you believe in an all powerful god, and if your atheist most of them are because of bad experiences in life and being alone in those moments. Many are also because they don't see the need to believe in anything if their life is successful that's also true this movie proves a lot of people are like that, and many don't believe because many people don't believe in what can't be seen or touched their skeptical. The Only thing I saw bad was the abrupt ending like in many movies you want to know what happened with the kid? the professors girlfriend? the reporter when she didn't feel alone anymore? but the rest of the movie was great. It was pretty realistic of the real world. Many hypocrites in many religions and many people just don't believe.",

I feel as if I wasted 2 hours of my life and it was painful to watch. The amount of stereotypical bashing of non-Christians is huge. Atheists are portrayed as all irrational, closed minded individuals that only are atheists because something bad has happened to them to turn them away from a god. Muslims are portrayed as extremists and are portrayed as being oppressed from finding the \"true religion\" of Christianity. Chinese are stereotyped as being overly smart at math and science and shown that religion or a deity can only be a burden. In America Christianity is still viewed as the majority religion. In this movie, the entire classroom of students is to be assumed that they are either atheists or \"bad Christians. This would be statistically improbable. I understand the premise of the movie is to promote Christianity but the blatant stereotyping and roundabout reasoning makes is very painful to watch.",

Jesus got betrayed and lost his friends (who swore they would be there for him) and on top of it all had to walk alone carrying the cross. This kid lost a lot also. His teachers respect, his girlfriend and he also risked his future. Plus this is a Christian movie, I'm tired of reading all these posts from these atheists saying \"I don't hate God, it's just a shitty movie\" Guess what I don't watch some atheist movie and then give it a bad review because I don't agree with it, I don't care enough to even be interested in a movie like that. Thus every atheist giving this movie a bad review is just as bitter as the professor and trying to do what he couldn't. Also every atheist does hate God, if you say you don't care yet your dissing out the movie, that's hatred. Also if you give the only excuse you can to wiggle yourself out of it \"I don't believe in God\" I'll give the same question I give every atheist \"Just imagine if he did\" then you will respond with the answer 95% of atheists do \"Then he doesn't care about us because we're suffering\". Please, if you have a bite to eat and a place to sleep you have more than 90% of the world. You have no right to bitch. And the Muslim dad, I don't see it as stereotypical, that guy is just a dick. I've been to war and where I was fathers raping their kids is not frowned upon. But back to the movie. Overall very good, i loved the music, the determination to serve God even against all odds is how every Believer should act. 10/10 and ignore all the other critics, even Christians should recognize this movie as something dedicated to God, even if they feel offended it's only because they sympathize with atheists, I don't.

The type of Christians who like this movie are mostly mindless consumers who don't question authority or even their own beliefs. This movie is out right Christian propaganda. By making every non Christian in this movie a terrible person, they attempt to keep from drawing any of your own conclusions about religion. There is absolutely nothing subtle about this movie. Real life Chrstianity is complicated and filled with many tough questions. Instead of addressing these questions, God's Not Dead terminates the narrative entirely by making religion as simple as 'Christian- good, Not Christian- evil'.If this was a movie that simply panders to the Christian audience then maybe it could be forgivable. But on top of that, the acting is awful, cinematography is bland, and the writing sounds like an alien trying to guess what real people talk like. God's Not Dead may think they are helping Christianity, but their obvious bias towards Christianity only turns people away from religion.",

A lot of people have been saying that it supports the stereotype of people of the Islam religion being rude to Christians and atheist being seeing as villains. Yes, in the movie the main antagonist is a atheist and yes the father of Aisha support the stereotype of being rude to his daughter. However that doesn't mean that the movie wants to tell us that every Islam father acts that way or that all atheist are that intolerant, those are just simply the characters in the movie. Anyone who got offended by this just took it personal. \"The movie is too preachy\". Well, what do you expect? It's a Christian movie and it is obvious that they are going to preach about their believes and point of views on life, which aren't necessarily bad. Don't expect anything else. Also, people complaining that the movie is \"preachy\" it's because they don't like to be confronted with the truth. Most people don't accept the truth at first sight, some never do and because they don't, they get mad if they hear it.I think this was great movie with a great message. It spoke out for so many Christians that have passed or are passing through similar situations such as Josh. I think it's okay that Christians woke up and defend their point of views based on their beliefs. University is always teaching that is good to debate, that we must defend out point of view, but when that point of view is based on Christian belief is automatically designated as wrong and non-intelligent. If there is going to be right to free speech than it must be for everyone, not just for a few. I think everyone (Christians or non-Christians) should respect each others point of views.",

There is another review calling it a \"chain mail\" movie. Perfect description. They literally try to scare you into thinking bad things will happen to you if you dislike God then proceed to tell you text everyone you know that God's not dead.The movie is clearly premised in an argumentative tone that carries on throughout the movie. The characters are very flawed to the point of being unrealistic. Generally, when watching a movie, most people kind of \"know\" someone like some of the characters in a drama. There isn't a single person that comes close to how some of these characters behave. Unrealistic just to make viewers dislike certain characters.",

            "content": "I went into this movie knowing very little about it, other than seeing one thirty second trailer. Thought it would be worth watching. And in the end, I had mixed feelings.I like the basic premise -- a young college kid has to defend his faith against a professor who, for his own very personal reasons, doesn't believe in God. This may have been presented as one young man against a world full of atheists, but to me it was this one guy trying to win over his professor (albeit on a bigger stage than just one on one in the professor's office.) Most strikingly, his final argument, \"How can you hate Someone who doesn't exist?\" isn't an irrefutable argument any Christian can use against any \"anti-theist\" you come across, and there are some potentially valid responses to such a question, but it was one aimed directly at the professor himself to make him question his own beliefs, and in that regard, it was effective.I also liked something in the storyline with Amy (the reporter who finds out she has cancer). Or, rather, how they left her storyline rather open-ended. She ended up seeking God, but they didn't have a scene where she went to the doctor the following morning and found that her cancer had miraculously \"disappeared\" overnight. That really would've upset me. While I do know of some medical \"miracles\", something like that would've been all too convenient. Instead, you're left wondering what would happen. Chemo and surgery may get rid of it, or it may not. Treatments may prolong her life, or they may not. She can pray to God asking for healing, but He may say \"no\". To quote the professor, \"He says that a lot.\" But either way, she found a peace that she didn't have before.However, there were a number of things I didn't like in this movie. First, the characters were mostly reduced to stereotypes. Most of the atheists in the movie were self-absorbed jerks. The Muslim father was intolerant of his daughter's new-found faith. The atheist professor was an atheist because God \"failed\" him early in life. Yes, there are a number of atheists who fit that stereotype, but not all atheists are like that. There are Muslim teenagers and young adults who have to hide their religion from their families because they would be thrown out of the house or disowned if they were discovered, but not all of them are like that. The movie doesn't specifically say that \"all atheists are X\" or \"all Muslims are Y\", but you could get that impression. Granted, in a story with limited time and a limited cast, it's very easy to paint your characters as caricatures, but it makes for a much better story if you give your characters depth or contrast the \"extreme\" examples on each side with more moderate characters in the mix.The bit with the pastor's car was amusing, but it was almost cheesy. Something that could've either been played for some real laughs or could've turned more serious/meaningful (\"God has a reason for this. Keep your eyes open and see what He brings your way.\") came across as more of a running gag to pass the time. Yes, there was an underlying meaning to it, but the pastor seemed oblivious to it throughout. (Maybe that was supposed to be the real joke -- the pastor comically missing the point?) Finally, the ending. After the argument, when the students stood up to say \"God is not dead\", I was hoping some of them would qualify that saying, \"I don't know if I believe in Him or not, but I'm not going to shut out that possibility.\" But that's way too wordy. Maybe that's what some of them meant, but it's not very clear. And then I wish it would have ended in the classroom during the following week's session, with the professor still grappling with his own beliefs and giving each of the students the chance to make up his/her own mind, and maybe then cut to a scene with Mark talking to his sister about his questions and doubts or talking to Amy about her cancer and her new-found faith. Instead, the professor is senselessly and needlessly killed -- possibly by Mark, it's hard to say -- and he stays alive just long enough to make a death-bed confession. (Yes, either the pastor or his friend DID yell out for someone to call 911 first, and only after he knew that help was on the way did he talk to the professor about his spiritual condition, but still.) Had he survived his injuries, and had they credited his conversion for that or implied that it played a part, that would've seemed a little fishy, but I thought it was unnecessary. Plus that, juxtaposed with the upbeat Newsboys concert, was a little too much for me.It wasn't a waste of time or money, but at best, I don't think it will spur dialogue between Christians and non-Christians (unless Christians who see this decide on their own to investigate why they believe what they believe and try to defend it themselves), and at worst it gives atheists more ammo to declare Christians paint them unfairly.",

And the writers are gutless because they assert these claims knowing that the vast majority of their audience will not be atheist or Muslim, and thus the claims will not be refuted.If the depiction of atheists is accurate, then why not have an atheist play the role of the professor? Surely, an atheist would have no problem playing the part as they no ethics or morality, right?I was hoping for a reasonable balanced discussion on the merits in this movie, and for a split second it seemed like that might happen as the protagonists first remarks on the topic of the existence of God were remarkably astute.

I see that some people are bothered by the portrayal of some of the characters in this movie, I can understand that to an extent, however, in reality many people in the world ARE that way if not more-so. I've been around the world and I've lived in America for 32 years... Here in America we are used to having low budget, \"christian\" films who show a generic amount of what it truly means to believe in God. On the other hand in mainstream films and in the media in general, \"christians\" are made to look like bigots and idiots with no legitimate reasons to believe in what many atheists call a \"sky daddy.\" Well...This movie DEMOLISHES those anti-God notions with absolute TRUTH and more proof of who He is than who He isn't!! The main point of this movie is the real life DEBATE details, not the characters. Anyway you look at it, if you pay attention to and and take all stances into account with the debates in a REAL LIFE manner, you won't be able to go by in life Truly believing that there is no God... our Creator! You could say that I'm easily swayed and brainwashed, ignorant and need a crutch, but according to all things that matter in life, it's just the opposite. You'll also see that there were at least 40, yes FORTY --> REAL-LIFE, DOCUMENTED, COURT CASES HERE IN America that took place because of similar events of discrimination and hate towards \"Christian\" groups and students on college campuses. Yes, even here in America and to this very day - and growing!Lastly, please remember this if nothing else from this review: As you all go throughout life meeting people who claim to be Christians (simply meaning: a follower of Jesus Christ) yet they display any HATE towards anyone... it's got to be legitimate 'hate'... What do I mean? Well to clarify, just because one may disagree with something or someone or ANY particular act or lifestyle (those lifestyles go beyond homosexuality though that may be included...) does NOT mean that they \"hate\" them at all)... Now back to the original point-- Not everyone who claims to be a Christian truly is one. What do I mean? Well, standing in a garage all day, everyday will not turn a person into a car. And the same applies to church, just because someone goes doesn't make them a true Christian... God does love ALL people whether we hate Him or believe in Him or not. At His essence He IS love, He created it (1 John 4:8) and He wants you to know that He does love YOU, despite the sins we've all committed, despite ANYTHING any of us has ever done or didn't do. That's why He sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for ALL of mankind, every ethnicity, every nationality, every religion, EVERY person. Seems so clich\u00e9, but it's so true: John 3:16. And finally, read: Romans 10:9-10. The decision is our own. Free will. It all comes down to whether we receive or reject the Love of God through His only Son, Jesus Christ.

Most people judge God by people. So why not judge all doctors by the fact that people are sick and dying, why not judge all hair stylists by the fact that people's hair looks terrible, why not judge all stylists by the fact that some horrible dress terribly. This movie clearly demonstrates that it is a free choice. Oh and to the person who insinuated that it was a bad scene in the movie when the professor was presented with a last chance to accept God before he died from the car wreck... tell me, what do you have to offer someone dying?

It has even been said that the movie makers are behind the film in an attempt to make money off of God.I believe that is missing the point of the movie. I for one certainly wouldn't want to sit through 4 hours of a movie only for character development. It is not about if this main character had anxiety about speaking in front of people or the professor's deep dark history of his Mother's death. Instead, the point is that God works in the lives of all people, who are connected in ways they don't even know about. There is a trickle effect via each of our actions. In this instance, a movie based upon a number of stories collected over the years from student who have stood up for their faith was told as well as it could be in an hour and forty five minutes. It makes perfect sense, and I for one enjoyed the movie immensely.",

            "content": "Hello, the reason I believe God's Not Dead is an awesome movie is because it shows us the devastating affects of hating God. If this movie offends you, I am sorry. We Christians are told by Jesus Christ to share the Gospel. I have nothing but love for all people in writing this. I am not trying to force my believe on you and I don't believe this movie is either. This movie is simply trying to get people to come to Jesus for true life, true peace of mind, and enduring, lasting, steadfast hope. I hated God at one time in my childhood for making me the way I was so I know some people do hate God, but He has never hated them. He is not willing any to perish and be cast into Hell. The fact that the movie portrays a Muslim extremists father is not saying that all Muslims are that way, so don't take it the wrong way. Neither is it saying that all atheist hate God. This professor just happens to hate God in the movie. Also, if you are a Christian and you are offended by this movie, watch other movies made by Pureflix and you will see as I did, they aren't trying to offend anyone, they are simply spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This movie is not calling anyone an idiot or saying they are dumb, it is simply trying to set the record straight that God is NOT Dead. I am very glad that I am not an atheist cause there is no joy in believing this life is it and I'm just going to the grave to rot. I would have nothing to live for, cause what good is money, fame and fortune when we won't be taking any of it with us when we die. Believing and accepting Jesus as your Savior is all that is needed for true riches that will never perish, spoil or fade in Heaven. Jesus said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life, No one will ever come to God accept thru Me. He also said, \"I give you peace, not as the world gives.\" He is saying, the world tries to give you peace thru alcohol, drugs, and sex but nothing will ever satisfy you but Jesus and His love that He wants all people to know. He created you, so why not just surrender your life to Him. He said, anyone who wants to keep his life, will loose it and why gain the whole world and it's riches and loose your own soul, to be cast into Hell. Watch the movie again and let it speak to you and don't be so negative against something you haven't tried yet. The Holy Spirit will convict you of your need for Jesus, but responding the way you need to is entirely up to you. Try Jesus and you will never ever regret it. God bless you all. Thanks.",

            "content": "If you think \"God's Not Dead\" is good then here are some reasons on why you're wrong.I just want to note that if you're Christian and you agree with everything this movie says then good for you but I won't praise a movie just for promoting Christianity. My review/take isn't intended to insult Christianity or any religious beliefs for that matter but it's just me taking a critical look at this film for what it really is.This isn't a movie, it's religious propaganda. No matter what my personal beliefs are, making a 2-hour movie meant to brainwash the audience is insulting. Christians deserve a better movie than this. This is 100% just pandering to Christians, insulting to Muslims, and honestly, I think this 'movie' was made to change the mind of atheists which if they saw this; they'd laugh.It'd be more interesting if this 'movie' were to tackle complicated issues with Christianity like homosexuality or abortion but it doesn't. Or if that example is too controversial for a movie then they could've at least shown a complicated character with mixed emotions on what to feel about religion then maybe the atheists watching this could latch onto that character and go through what that character goes through BUT NO.Which leads me to my next point. The one atheist in this movie is cruel, narcissistic and depressed while everyone else that is religious is happy. The movie fails to address the fact that the bad guy (the atheist) is bad because of his dark past. -Not all atheists are trying to shove an agenda down your throat (unlike this propaganda) and this might shock the makers of this movie but there are atheists out there that are genuinely good people. The 'movie' isn't trying to be smart, the movie isn't raising any questions but the movie is TELLING you how to feel.The script is bad, the editing is bad, the characters are bad. Oh, and the acting is so bad that I laughed at parts that were supposed to be dramatic.The only plot line that I liked was with the Muslim girl but even that is barely developed and the execution is TERRIBLE.",

I don't call myself an atheist, I just don't like religion. With that out of the way, this movie is so horrifically offensive to anyone who isn't a straight, white Christian. Christian movies seem to follow the pattern of having a non-believer, or someone from a different religion. The whole point of the movie is the conversion of that person to Christianity. That's bad enough as it is, but what this movie does is so much worse. The movie paints anyone who isn't Christian as a horrible person with massive flaws in their character. And to make it even more insulting, one of the underlying messages of the movie is to let people believe what they want. So the message of the movie ends up being \"It's ok to believe what you want, and shove those beliefs down people's throats, but only if you're a Christian. And if you're not a Christian you're a horrible person.\" I gave this movie a chance, and I went in thinking \"Well I may not like the message, but it may be a well put together movie.\" I was so, so wrong. It has a blatant message that is insulting to the 2/3rds of people on earth who aren't Christian, and it's not even a well made movie. There's not subtlety. It relies on basic cliches and stereotypes. The quality and acting are something similar to a feature length porno.This is just a bad movie. It's technically bad, and insults the audience. This kind of propaganda is why people are becoming more and more fed up with American Christianity. I have no problems with Christians, but this kind of shit is destroying the image of all religion. Please, don't support this movie. If they keep making money, they'll just keep making more shit-shows of insulting Christian superiority.",

What i really don't understand is, why on earth a most frightening professor didn't shred the arguments to pieces and why he just let it happen. Then the arguments made on behalf of God are showed in real hurry. Really don't know why? Then the supporting plots the conversion of girl, really don't know what they are trying to show and prove. Even the other plots, really don't make any sense what so ever. To sum it up, really a waste. Could have been much much better.

            "content": "To make a film that presents Christian apologetics in an entertainment format is every bit as daunting a challenge as the one the film's hero faced. However, it fell short in a number of places. 1. Let's start with the casting irony. Superman (Dean Cain in \"Lois and Clark\") and Hercules (Kevin Sorbo) are the anti-God villains? But let's give credit where credit is due: Cain did a fairly good job of playing a Lex Luthor-like corporate guy, throwing his girlfriend to the curb because she got cancer. 2. This movie was set in a Philosophy class. In a survey class such as that, dealing with those \"dusty arguments\" (aka Philosophy of Religion) is an important component, whose absence IRL would have been ridiculous. For example, let the film examine things like Aristotle's \"first mover\" argument, Anselm's ontological argument, things like that. The creation vs. evolution discussion is more the province of a science class. 3. It's already been said in other reviews here, but Kevin Sorbo has done much better work elsewhere. The Prof. Radisson character was a caricature; one half expected him to deliver lectures from a chair in a Nehru jacket while petting a Persian cat, such was the total absence of character nuance here.4. The appearance of any member of the Duck Dynasty family. By 2014, they had pretty much jumped the shark thanks to Daddy Phil's intemperate statements. What cultural relevance they still possess comes from their remaining marketing to evangelicals. In short, it was something that could have been very strong, but instead of presenting good arguments, it was a study in reinforcing confirmation bias.",

Thank you for demonstrating your misrepresentation of science, philosophy, atheism, and so on. Thank you for illegally filing false DMCA claims of other people criticism of this film. And thank you for showing to everyone that you are morally bankrupt.For the record atheism is not synonymous to evolution. The only ones making this claim, are the creationist themselves. You don't have to give up your religion to except evolution.I could go into details about the movie, when it comes to acting, writing, performance, etc, but that's not the important thing. Atheist expected this, because it's next to impossible to have a religious conversation with people like this without being accused of, bigotry, bullying, evil, no morals, self-worshiping, mockers. Well they're right about that last one, a lot of atheist will stick with mocking. Because most of us have learned the hard way that mocking is the only method that seems to works. Even accusing me of things I've never even utter. Many may be offended by this movie, Christians on the other hand should be even more offended by it. If anything, Christians in this film were even more stereotypical. They were one sided, unchangeable, self-righteous. To the Christians acting confused or coming up with answers why those meanie grumpy atheist disapprove this film. Maybe because they betrayed them as bad, evil people. Pretty much what you guys have been doing to us since forever. While you betray us as evil, you expect us to just remain silent about it. This is your definition of fair. While you push your religious beliefs on society. But when we utter one word, you always end up playing the victim card. And of course cramming this movie with straw man argument.but what beautiful about this movie, that this isn't from... you know, your Typical anti-religion movie. This is 100% hands down done by religious fundamentalist.As an atheist I'm not hurt by this movie, because I didn't expect anything less. But what I am hurt by is knowing your beautiful mind is being vandalize by superstition.\u0085................................................My question to the Christians both who loved this film and found(somehow) comfort from it; and those who were disgusted by it. Is this what you want; is this how you want to represent? If not, glad to hear it. But let me give you a warning about these fundamentalist. They are not going to change anytime soon. They're not going to improve their views or behavior. Mark my words, they're going to get a whole lot worst. You must do what is right, I've seen churches stood up against the westboro baptist church, you can do the same.If you do like it and support it. Please, pleeeeeease by all means continue. I'm looking forward To live in the future where religion becomes the minority. Your doing a great service for us, and your continued hypocrisy is just barley the icing on the cake. It is obvious you guys are getting desperate because of the rise of the non-religious. Even some recent reports shows that it has grown even more. And I look forward in your next propaganda movie or documentary.Because the one thing religious propaganda have always prove me wrong, is when I think they can't get anymore crazy. If you think I'm saying that to be mean. Check out \"Kidnapped for Christ\", I'm not even going to dare you. This is great example what happens when religion has way too much immunity and power. But even after watching that documentary, I'm convinced we have yet to see the worst.",

We LOVE you & want to spend eternity in Heaven w/ you-that is why we do what we do. This is why we try our hardest to make you understand the RISK you are taking by NOT believing. BUT, that being said, we can't do anymore than that. All we can do is pray & hope that something we said, or something you watched will change your mind & make you realize all Christianity is, is LOVE. Love is Jesus, Love is God, Jesus is Truth, God is Good- please, tell me, what is negative about this? What is negative about our belief? Our belief is nothing but love. When you have no belief, how do you have hope? How do you have faith? What is your point on this earth? WHY ARE YOU HERE? If there is nothing, & no one when you die, then why do you walk this earth? Why do you face the everyday challenges you face, why must you make choices from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep? Why do you love? Why do others love you?Again, all we can do, as Christians, is speak the word & pray you will listen & know what love is. This movie is doing just that. By the way, if you hated this movie so much & Christians are \"always trying to force their religion on everybody\", then why, I ask, DID YOU GO SEE THE MOVIE IN THE FIRST PLACE? I am sure nobody tied you to a chair & FORCED you to listen & watch it. You knew what it was going to be-there was no secret in the title. There was a reason you watched it-maybe God is trying to speak to you, just listen. Quit being stubborn & open you heart. Have faith- I only hope I will join you in heaven one day & that's all God wants. But you still HAVE A CHOICE-nobody can MAKE you do anything. I am sure this will upset many people but that is not the point. I am not here to judge, torment, point fingers, or anything. I am merely here to share the Word of God & bring as many people to Jesus as I can. I will fail, I will be tormented because of my faith & what I've written here, but I do this only for my Father in Heaven who one day will say \"Well done, good & faithful servant\". That is why I am here. In the end, you make your own choice-no need to comment, no need to argue. Just know I love you, Jesus loves you, God loves you-everyone will know the truth one day-do you want to risk being wrong? My friend, there are no coincidences-everything happens for a reason.",

Though I just have one thing to say, the movie was about the existence of God VS atheism.. then why you had to show that Islam is an oppressive religion.

Hopefully Hollywood, will realize that people want to still hear about God other then in churches. Kevin Sorbo, was excellent in his role as the professor. He was very believable based on how teachers are in schools now, especially college professors that seem to force their believe system on children. Education should only go so far, and as parents we have to make sure that our children are still raised with good values. Dean Cain, played a great role as well.

Firstly, all of the Atheists/non Christians were portrayed as bad guys who have problems and the Christians are portrayed as the good guys or victims of abuse. For example the professor that has issues and the Muslim father who kicked his Christian daughter out. The professor's Christian wife, the Christian daughter, and Josh are portrayed as victims of corrupt atheists. The professor seems like he is not only atheist but anti-theist but this was not mentioned at all. This made it seem like all atheists were against religion and God when that is not the case. Secondly, the movie was really unrealistic. The professor basically tried to convert everyone in his class to become atheists or anti-theists by making them sign a statement, \"God is dead\" on the first day of class. This makes it seem like all atheists are crazy people trying to convert Christians. Also, I really doubt that in a real college the professors are extreme dictators with emotional problems so this part was sort of weird. Furthermore, though Josh's answer to \"Who created God\" was pretty solid, the rest of his arguments for the existence of God are weak and can be easily refuted by atheists. Overall, this movie terrible and I would not even recommend it to Christians as it does not support their faith in any valid way.",

This movie has definitely a huge respect in my heart as it made me nervous and look for God more.There are many spoilers rating this movie very bad. Don't believe those!

Many people do not read the Bible and live with this idea of either there is no God. Or we come from some mass explosion. Or maybe we come from apes or animals and evolved. Many do believe the Bible is the inspired word of God. Many have heard or know the story of Moses. Basically the Israelites were in Egypt as slaves for 400 years. God sent Moses to deliver them out of Egypt. After several plagues Pharoah finally let them go. Then God told them they were going to the Promised land Canaan the land flowing with milk and honey. It was supposed to be a three day journey. But because they still sinned against God, some not believing in God and had other Idols they wandered the wilderness for 40 years before they were able to enter in the promised land. So movies like this to give a clear message that God exists made me realize that man In is like the Israelites and they are in either Egypt which represents the world, in the Wilderness believing in God but still sinning and in bondage wandering in circles in the desert. Or in Canaan the land flowing with milk and honey which represents a Spirit Filled life. From the comments left from Atheist and Christians you can see where they are in their Journey in seeking God or if God exists. My suggestion for the person in Egypt should read Proverbs 29:1 and beware. For the so called Christians should read 1 Corinthians 6:9-11. And for the true believers read Matthew 28:18-20",

By the end of the film it is easy to see that this is a paid advertisement for those who want to find in science explanations for the existence of something that does not exist. Besides the fact that it is clearly a vehicle to convince people that Christianity is the true \"Faith\" and there is nothing more right than it. When a movie made for teenagers clearly contains a doctrinatory advertising it should come in its summary a better explanation of its contents.I watched until the end wondering what the professor somewhere in the movie would advocate agnosticism or atheism with graphics, charts and data but at any time the exponent of the non-theists produces solid arguments being beaten by a theistic and Christian first semester first semester student in philosophy. This is more than surreal. I had excellent professors of philosophy and even if he were theistic or atheistic philosophy serves to question and not to create bonds.I don't know of a case where a philosophy professor would require students to sign a document on their first day of school saying \"God's Died.\" First, knowing the history of philosophy we are familiar with theistic philosophers such as St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas or St. Teresa of Avila, it would be hard to imagine a professor of philosophy stating a course of Introduction to Philosophy that God's Died. Yes there is a specific Yale University course in philosophy called Death (PHIL176) Professor Shelly Kagan, but it is not an introductory course. This film does a disservice stating that philosophy does not have strong arguments different from religion. Theology and Philosophy are separated for more than 300 or 400 years.When And where a first semester student would have arguments so solid to unseat an incumbent and free thinking professor teaching philosophy?This is another surreal film.To get an idea of the fierce advertising this film had a budget of $ 2 million and has so far grossed almost $ 61 million. Clearly it is a project funded by The Duck Dynasty who also appear in it and are the group of fundamentalist Christians who have program on American television and have demonstrated their faith and irrationality in their comments on TV.",

Immediately everyone screeched, fainted or puked! It was awesome! I've found that it can also work on mailmen, ugly neighbors or just about anyone else that doesn't realize that they only picked their religion based on where they live! (Just keep in mind if you do this use brown sugar and not actual ashes.)I felt bad and told everyone the truth but they were still mad at me because I used brown sugar, and they said it would be better to use white sugar based on the Caucasian man on the stained glass paintings from the the Middle Ages created to indoctrinate the illiterate. In conclusion, it's not important what ethnicity Jesus was, what's really important is that if you drink heavily during this movie and you swerve left or right on the way home, the rumble strips on the road will wake you up in plenty of time before you get in trouble.HITLER'S WIFE WAS A JEW",

Now I'm a devout catholic (theres no hiding that and I don't want to) so some maybe surprised that it took me that long but the reason is that most Christian movies(mostly being protestant based) I'm sorry are just not that good(yes this is my opinion) Im glad you're making a movie about God but the stories the characters sometimes are just flat out dumb or the story's everywhere etc. And I'm sorry to say that \"Gods Not Dead\" is pretty much the same mess Now I want to stress I don't hate the movie and I do think it brought up some good points and I wouldn't be against anyone else seeing it for themselves to judge, I liked some of the debate parts(though a bit too unrealistic for my personal liking) and I get the message it was trying to get across; over all it got its basic message across but how it got there was just disorganized. The film had too and I mean way too many characters that I found it hard to concentrate on what was supposed to be the main issue \"Gods not Dead\" and that part of story ended up just being one out of many issues presented, that part of the film was about a student challenging his professor on why the notion of \"God is dead\" like atheist radicals like Richard Dawkins try to assert is wrong. I did find this interesting but its approach I thought was flawed in how it was done I mean from personal experience I've never seen a professor do this(he'd probably be sat down in front of the school board for his bias especially in Philosophy if he really was that bad) the closest was a professor of mine who was an atheist and addressed Marxism etc. but he certainly didn't impose it just addressed what was there in the subject. But beyond that main story which should've just focused on the \"Gods Not Dead\" part instead just dosed off to many other stories that while I thought were touching didn't quite achieve what they wanted and many times it was like the film was just up in your face about it just kind of out of no where like where did that come from? And all the while I'm wondering why aren't we focusing on \"Gods Not Dead\" I mean that was the main focus right? By the end the \"gods not dead\" text just seem to be thrown in there to those side stories even though in these stories it wasn't a question of \"God's dead or isn't dead\" but more like is God in you're life? Or looking for a reason to believe. While there are similarities I don't see them as really being the same subject and for sure the closeted Christian woman in the Muslim household in my opinion just had no business being in there because that was a separate issue altogether (Muslims don't deny the existence of God or Christ for that matter but rather that Christianity isn't true and that is different from saying God is Dead by a long shot so idk where that story came from at that point it was like \"you're just trying to squeeze stories in here on purpose\"). Certainly the debate between the student and the professor was just too one sided and more importantly the Atheist that's represented by the professor is a person that just isn't truly atheist but just mad at God and has masked this with being an atheist (by doing this it assumes that most atheists are just angry at God and aren't genuinely atheist but just hurt and unfortunately this is just not the case its far more complex but this film just tried to make it simplified it that even describes it?)Anyways like I said I didn't actually hate the film and I did like some of the stuff brought up but I think as a film it fails and instead should've been a documentary addressing these issues of Christianity in the face of these different issues. The acting was mediocre at best and the writing really needed some help but basic direction I suppose was OK at least. I'd give this film a 3 1/2 or if I'm being generous ill give it a 4 but only if i was being generous. to date the best Christian films(or films with Judeo Christian stuff) is:The Ten Commandments The Prince of Egypt The Passion of the Christ Our Lady of Fatima For Greater Glory(Though that has some flaws the writing and story were still way better than this even Roger Ebert had to agree and mostly for bringing up a subject the Mexican Government as attempted to Suppress) The Agony and the Ecstasy(Though not a direct Christian film still dealt with Catholic culture and thought so it gets a mention for that reason) The Rite(too catholic for its own good :D)Those are a few I can think of right now and I stand by them, all these other films GOds Not Dead, Courages(though I thought that was better than this), Left Behind, etc. I appreciate what they're trying to do but come on give a better story at least.",

Pretty good storytelling and script.Cons:1. Bad apologetics.2. Flawed execution of premise.3. Lazily written protagonist.4. Sends a variety of wrong messages.5. Stupid subplots.6. The script really falls apart in the third act.7. Oh, and the soundtrack ins't great either. The terrible Christian rock music at the end is especially grating.Many detractors say the premise is ridiculous. I actually think the basic premise is quite clever and even fairly realistic. The way it's executed however is ridiculous and unrealistic.Many of these people who insist that it is unrealistic for an atheist professor to try to force a Christian student to defend his faith in class would be the same people defending the professor if such a thing actually happened, saying Christians shouldn't be exempt from having to defend their beliefs with evidence and that they have it coming if they want to challenge the entirely of peer reviewed science or some other lazy excuse.That said, the idea of the professor only giving the student three days to argue his case, and of the student accepting the challenge so readily, and of none of the other students including the atheist ones finding the whole thing the least bit objectionable is stretching to say the least.It would be more realistic for the professor to say \"I'll give you a month to prepare and then 20 minutes at the end of the last day of class of each week until April to present, plus you have to write a 12 page essay on which I will grade you for how well you convince me of the validity of your religion. I anticipate that about halfway through you will realize that you are just embarrassing yourself, sign the damn paper, and then we can move on from your youthful stupidity and delusions of grandeur.\" Granted, that might be harder to fit into a feature length script, but it would be a lot more realistic and make it a lot more difficult for atheists to just dismiss the whole movie as being based on a fundamentally ridiculous plot.But, since they didn't chose that route, they left themselves with no choice but to use the most shallow and unconvincing arguments. Sure, within the context of a broader theological and philosophical debate the points they raise might have merit, but the confines of the script don't allow for broad theological and philosophical debate.The movie at least doesn't also pander by having all the atheist students gang up and bully the protagonist as well, and in fact it treats the other atheists besides the professor quite charitably. But it's somewhat disengenuous that in the beginning not one of them will admit to having a problem with a professor blatantly abusing a Christian student and by the end they are all confessing that God Is Not Dead.I also think this movie sends the wrong message to young Christians in positions of vulnerability and tries to inspire them with a false and dangerous sense of worldly invincibility in the face of persecution, which is typical of evangelicals. The whole \"put on the full armor of Christ and you can do it\" theme is simplistic at best and dangerous at worst. Contrary to what evangelicals will try to tell you, Christians are not called to automatically accept challenges to defend their faith wherever and whenever they are issued. Challenges by people in positions of power over you where their clear and only intent is to use your as a weapon against your faith and to \"make an example\" of you are especially not something that you should rise to lightly. In the case of campus persecution, there are lawyers and administrative appeals for a reason, and in most cases it may be best to just use them.It also doesn't help that the protagonist is a Marty-Stu pretty boy with everything going for him in life who's able to meet the challenge because he's just such a smart young man. If there's one thing the movie does right, it's that they at least made it clear that the antagonist has known real suffering in life. But that ends up making the professor more real and relatable than the protagonist whose biggest concern is that he might not make it into law school if he accepts the professor's challenge.But perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is the same problem that can be found in almost every facet of the US evangelical movement: it makes worship about you, rather than Christ. The theology of this movie is not Christ-centered. I don't see this movie as being about a brave kid who defends his faith in the face of persecution, I see this movie as being about a kid who discards all judgment and discernment to prove a point, because like the evangelical movement as a whole this is really about his Personal Crusade for Christ rather than serving the will of the Lord. In that way him and the professor at least have a little in common. If you're an evangelical you may not be able to see that, but your atheist friends can, and if you plan to use this movie as a tool of evangelism then be prepared to be disappointed. If you just watch it as personal inspiration then it's somewhat more suited to that purpose, but even then you need to be wary of the messages the movie sends.",

            "content": "\"God's Not Dead\" Very emotional and informative movie 10/10 Author: ctyankee1 from United States 27 March 2015I watched this movie and a professor who teaches philosophy in a college is an atheist and only teaches his perspective and the writings of other atheist. He wants all the students to write on a paper \"God is Dead\" and hand it in. One student-Josh does not want to write this so the professor gets mad and tells Josh Wheaton played by Shane Harper who is the star of movie to prove his case.Professor Radisson played by Kevin Sorbo sets the movie off and challenges Josh the student to prove that he will fail in proving God is not dead.Josh takes the challenge and angers the professor. Josh uses the same people that the professors uses to shred top atheist opinions and writings. Josh also uses Scripture at sessions he is given at the end of the class to refute the professors teaching.There is a lot going on. Josh's girlfriend does not want to take the challenge and uses their relationship to control what he wants to do. He talks to a minister who gives him Scripture to read but Josh wants and answer from God. The Scripture is the answer for him to stand up for God and what he believes so he starts to study what he will present to his fellow students. He is kind of afraid but has faith and courage enough to speak to them and also use video and quotes from writers pro and con. His presentations are well presented and the professor gets madder and more threatening. There are students of different cultures that come to believe that \"God's not dead\" after Josh's last presentation and the class takes a vote. Later many of the students go to a Christian Rock event come to know Jesus and praise him at this event.So many things going on. It comes out many people reject God when they feel their prayer is not answered like the healing of a loved one, if they are in real emotional pain or something that is really important to them. They feel that God does not hear or answer their prayer. God gives us free will and we do not know why a lot of bad things happen but they do.I am a Christian and I believe in Jesus love and forgiveness in 2011 my daughter was murdered by her boyfriend and I grieve and cry a lot. Things we did together and places we went together and holidays are so painful at times. I don't blame God for this and I don't hate the man who killed my daughter. I just miss her. I know I will see her someday. I do know if it was not for the love of Jesus I could not get through my day.So watch the movie and see what you think. If you are going through a hard time you are not alone just allow Jesus to walk with you through it. You can watch it for free on the DailyMotion site.",

            "content": "Most of the reactions to this movie are negative. It's cheesy, hollow, and cringe-worthy. I agree, but I also have to put this in perspective. First, Christianity is not a monolith. Many Christians, probably the large majority, would see this movie as simplistic, uninspiring, and in fact embarrassing. The central event of Christianity is a man being tortured and nailed to a cross. It's not exactly a rosy image. There's something very raw at the heart of the religion. And the intellectual tradition of Christianity, in philosophical, theological, and artistic terms, is as sustained, rich, deep, and profound, as any tradition on our planet, if not much more so. This movie isn't pitched to what I consider the most authentic tradition and it doesn't begin to delve into the depths that tradition has attained.A lot of the way people react to a movie seems dependent on their world view, and what most people don't realize is, if the world view of a movie doesn't resonate with you, it doesn't mean your judgment is objective, nor that what moves you prefer might not seem equally cringe-worthy to someone else.The lion's share of movies these days are made with from a \"woke\" world view. To someone who doesn't subscribe to that view, those movies are equally hard to stomach. I'm not in the camp of this movie, but neither am I \"woke\". Woke movies generally leave me cold. I often find myself puzzled by how seemingly moved some of my woke friends can be at what seems to me pure woke schlock. They'll comment things like, such and such movie explored deep and painful issues at the cross-section of race, class, ... you get the idea. The majority of such movies aren't deep at all, and are too predictable and shallow to really strike me as worthy of serious reactions. I have no doubt that in a couple of decades, almost everyone will see them as embarrassingly simplistic pieces, stuck in a very brief cultural moment , just as we see \"God's not Dead\". In fact, I think they may even age less gracefully, because wokism doesn't even have an intellectual or artistic tradition behind it, certainly not one stretching back thousands of years.",

Shane Harper plays student Josh Wheaton who enrols in a philosophy class. Kevin Sorbo plays professor Jeffery Radisson who orders the students to write on a sheet declaring God dead. Issues begin when Wheaton refuses to sign it due to being Christian. Radisson allows him three classes to prove God's existence and the rest of the class will be the jury. Everyone discourages Wheaton. Even his controlling girlfriend breaks up with him. Other characters include a young female journalist who learns that she has cancer. A Muslim student is kicked out of her home by her traditional father when he learns that she is becoming Christian. An Asian student calls his reluctant father overjoyed with his new faith discovery. It struggles with over the top presentations of Christians vs unbelievers, which is a turn off to those who do not attend church. Otherwise this presents an awesome testimony of a believer standing up for his faith in the face of great opposition. Harper holds strong as Wheaton but the scene stealer is Sorbo as Radisson whose demons will be revealed. David A.R. White provides comic relief as a Pastor struggling with car trouble. Dean Cain is amusing as a businessman whose sister is a believer. Trisha LaFache steals moments as a left wing journalist who learns devastating facts about her health. For Christians this will be a triumph example of defending what you believe and reaching out to others in love. Score: 9 / 10",

The acting is solid, even the celebrity 'walk ons' by the Duck Commander & Mrs. and the Newsboys did a great job acting\u0085. But wait, they were so good because they were not acting at all! They really believe what they said in the film! Kevin Sorbo has probably the best acting in the movie because he is the only one who does not believe what he is saying. As a strong Christian, it must have taken some great acting ability to pull off the \"I hate God\" role, even if he has some personal experience with that following his three strokes in 1997. Bravo Kevin! And to those who have given it a \"1\" why did you bother going to see it? Or did you actually not go and are just panning it because you hate God and want to see the movie fail?

In it's portrayal of Christians and atheists, I did think the story line was pretty one-sided, so when Josh (Shane Harper) 'won' his argument against Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo), I didn't think it was very realistic that everyone in the class would stand up in support. The multiple story lines, some of which were left hanging, didn't do a lot to advance the core argument that 'God's Not Dead', even if it looked like Josh scored a home run when he challenged Radisson about hating an entity that he didn't believe in. The main idea surviving the picture is that each and every person gets to choose or decide for him/herself what they wish to believe. Beyond that, the feel-good aspect of the story reverts back to those who have faith and live it in their daily lives.",

The arguments were fun to watch but, the atheist side doesn't get a fair representation, and also the atheist character as much as it works in what his story is, doesn't do justice to what this film may have set out to do which is show an objective debate between professor and student about God's existence. I personally enjoyed it and would recommend it for other Christians but it isn't a movie that I think non Christians would enjoy for an accurate representation of who God is and why Jesus died for us.A much better take may have been to show the Muslim girls struggle with sin, and how she finds no freedom from sin in her works, or how other Christian characters struggle with their actions in their lives. Maybe focussing on why the student became a Christian and such a lover of God, alongside showing the atheist professor on why he hated God.",

            "content": "(Disclaimer: I actually did view this film in person, and the comments are my own \u2013 not talking points from a memo.)I applaud the intellectual integrity portrayed in the movie, \"God's Not Dead.\" This film performs a great service toward advancing a constructive dialog by skillfully articulating a few of the key points in this contentious, controversial and complex debate.1)The Big BangGenesis taught a Big Bang cosmology about 4000 years ahead of its time. When Moses wrote, \"In the beginning\u0085\" he described a radically different view of reality than any other religion or philosophy known to mankind. All other worldviews assumed an eternal, cyclical view of nature. However, the Bible claims that all time, space, matter, and energy have a beginning and an end. Science did not catch up to Scripture until the early 20th century. Even then, \"Big Bang\" was coined as a derogatory term by English astronomer Fred Hoyle to mock this radical idea, which was derided as \"Creationism in disguise.\" Nevertheless, scientists now universally accept a universe that began in a cosmic flash of energy 13.5 billion years ago. In fact, physicists from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics just recently discovered additional Big Bang evidence from ripples formed at the very dawn of creation.2) The Fossil RecordThe fossil record has decimated Darwin's hypothesis of the macroevolution of living things through random, unguided, natural processes. If Darwin's theory were true, we should expect to find many intermediate life forms, which would come and go through trial and error of random events, with only the fittest surviving. However, the opposite is true. Paleontology reveals biological \"Big Bangs\" (e.g., Cambrian Explosion) in which new life forms appear in a geological instant. The geological record does not even remotely resemble Darwin's famous \"Tree of Life\"; rather, the scientific data reveals a patchy lawn in which many phyla appear suddenly and simultaneously. Recent discoveries have further revealed cultural \"Big Bangs,\" which demonstrate that human beings also appeared upon the scene very quickly. Furthermore, genetic research in the last decade has invalidated the evolutionary view that human races evolved independently in different geographical locations. Rather, Y-chromosomal (male) and mitrochondrial (female) DNA research has conclusively proved that all human beings are the direct descendants of one male and one female. Scientists generally refer to this widely accepted new theory as the \"Adam and Eve\" hypothesis.3) Reason vs. EmotionIf \"reason\" is the motivation for refuting the concept of theism, then why are atheists so emotional in their interactions with those who consider an alternative viewpoint? Are devotees to \"reason\" not committed to diversity and free thought? That is the primary theme of this thought-provoking film: Why are champions of \"Reason\" so emotional and dogmatic?Young scientific phenom Hugh Ross was intrigued by the implications of the Big Bang theory as he pursued his doctorate in astrophysics. He understood that a beginning demands a Beginner since no effect can be greater than its cause. Thus began a search, which led this former agnostic to a commit his life to Jesus Christ as revealed in the Bible.Dr. Ross founded Reasons to Believe (reasons.org), which is dedicated to exploring questions of science and faith with intellectual honesty, scientific credibility, and a humble respect for all points of view. I have found Reasons to Believe to be the most informative and helpful source for answers on this fascinating subject. They have a staff of highly qualified PhD's in cosmology, physics and biochemistry, which offers incredible insights into the ramifications of cutting edge science for one's worldview and faith assumptions. They actually generate more light than heat.I would highly encourage anyone interested in an objective and respectful discussion of these issues to visit the RTB website at reasons.org.",

Back to the movie in a minute, but first:I'm 24 and was raised Christian, yet never enjoyed going to church until about 2 years ago. Long story short, I got involved with wrong crowd in school, got in trouble a lot, did drugs and other bad things. At the time I thought I was 'happy' but looking back now I've realized how dark a place I was in. I came to the point of really doubting my belief in God and it was very depressing because it gave me no hope of anything. Fortunately I slowly started looking to my faith, breaking bad habits, and praying cause that's all I could do. God has blessed me ever since as I trust in Him and bear my crosses.If you are atheist or struggle with your belief, please consider the possibility that God could exist. There is no scientific proof that says He doesn't, while there is plenty of evidence that points towards God's existence, both scientific and philosophical. Atheists, please don't assume that all believers are naive. Famous scientists that were either Christian or believers in God include Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Galileo Galilei, Max Planck, and many others. Albert Einstein said \"science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind\". Pascal's Wager essentially says that if God doesn't exist, it doesn't matter whether you believe or not because in the end consciousness ends, but if God does exist then not believing or not following His commandments is eternally very serious, while believing and treating others the way you want to be treated will give you eternal peace, joy, and love. Essentially this means we have nothing to lose if we look to God, and everything to gain. This sounds pretty good to me, so I'll go with it!Bottom line is that I have no doubt that God exists! He loves every person on this planet, whether they be good or bad. Does a good parent only love their child if he/she is good? No, they love them no matter what and will never give up on them even though the child may pull away. When we are children do we sometimes think our parents are wrong and we are right, only to find out they were right years down the road? Of course this happens. All of this is the same with God. He is our Heavenly Father and we are His children who He loves and will never give up on. Choose God who is perfect Peace, Joy, and Love.Anyways, I thought the movie was great and touched upon many reasons why we should believe in God. The acting is good for the most part in my opinion and there is some comic relief to ease the deep subject of the movie. Please go see it!!!Peace and Love :)",

But, I feel really strongly that this movie should get the lowest rating possible so that it might be shoved under one of Earth's tectonic plates where no one can ever watch it again. I began watching this movie not knowing the general storyline or that the movie was produced and funded by religious groups. Even though I myself am an Atheist, I went to a Catholic school for 10 years and am generally accepting of other people's faith. In all honesty, within the first fifteen seconds of watching the film I could tell it had some pretty strong religious undertones and was not all that excited, but seeing as I was with company I kept attentive. By the five minute mark I was starting to sweat. I have never seen a more openly racist, discriminatory movie in my life. God's Not Dead made Asians, Muslims and Atheists into evil \"bad guys\", while always showing Christian men and women to be intelligent and gentle leaders. It showed an 'evil Asian businessman' father demand his son to stop speaking about god, and state that he will cut all communication between them, as well as an 'insane, uncontrollable and sexist' Muslim father beat and excommunicate his daughter for listening to bible podcasts on her iPod. The 'evil, bigot' professor ignores and abuses his Christian, lovely girlfriend, and the 'inattentive, greedy businessman' son ignores his 'sick, religious' mother who has dementia, even when his 'lovely, Christian' sister demands him to visit. Beyond discriminating against religious and ethnic groups, I would go as far as to say that the movie puts big business in a very negative light, while showing small businessmen, such as the car-rental man, as being lighthearted and involved in their community. I really hope that no one who watches this movie finds themselves feeling any emotion other than disgust. Due to the offensive, strong and scary themes in this film, I may attempt to buy every copy and bury them underneath the Earth's crust. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody, as I think even the most devout Christians should find it to be a very poor representation of the meaning of and reasoning behind their faith.",

The film spins a flagrantly deceptive yarn in regards to the rationale that atheists use to justify their non-belief: they hate god, and so they choose not to follow him. The truth is that there is simply no substantive, scientific evidence for a super cosmic being's existence, so non-existence of such a being, the *default* stance, is simply the most sensible according to what we know. That is it. The film, of course, conspicuously omits this most basic of details in the pathetic defences the 'atheist' characters put up, the evangelical actors are clearly relishing the chance to portray their heretical characters in the most depraved way possible.

The Muslim teenager was taken to a temple in Brooklyn, there beaten, and held. We found out, seen him, yes they beat him, he was being guarded, and too afraid to come with us. Muslim Professor in a Cairo University (wrote book) just thinks about converting and he is placed into a prison. Eventually he converts and he and the Coptic's who spoke to him had to flee for their lives. 48 churches burnt down 8 months ago in Egypt! Stereotyping... maybe simply the real world?

Obviously the budget on this film curtails the ability for filmmakers to employ the very best people and on screen talent as is normal for Hollywood films as we all know. This is a film made in the realm of Christian movies, such as Left Behind, and Facing the Giants. And in this realm this film is head and shoulders above those as far as production value and acting ability. As far as the story goes, I did notice and made comment to my wife that the lone man of another faith was portrayed as he was, but the actor was powerful and the best in the film. Also there was a bad editing job done where two different takes were used when Sorbo learns his girlfriend left the wine in the car. This was a poor job in that regard, someone should have caught this somewhere. But everyone needs to understand: Christians try to tell others about Jesus because we believe He is real and He died to pay our debt for a life of sin. It is selfish not to tell, like having the cure for cancer and not sharing it with the world. We are not trying to spread propaganda, a negative thing, but spread the news of Jesus because we care about others. Some didn't like the way Sorbo's death was handled. The pastor was right, though, he was going to die, and going to Hell without Christ, but accepted Jesus' salvation in time, which would be a miracle for Sorbo's character. They were smiling after because someone going to Heaven instead of Hell IS something to smile about. Someone said in one review all the atheists became believers by the end, which is not true, Dean Cain still hadn't. It is what it is: a Christian based/budgeted movie and is is good by that standard. Perhaps the problem atheists are having is the popularity of it.",

I felt so bad for Sorbo for wasting his talent with it. I've never seen Duck Dynasty, but Robertson was fun to watch. He did a great job just by being himself. His few minutes on screen were the most tolerable of the movie. Occasional good performances can't begin to compensate for its over all awfulness.

But this movie is viewed as controversial, because the reviewers are polarized on whether they are for or against Christian movies. That is a shame, because this movie makes a significant contribution on the discussion of the origin of life! Have you read the 2013 book Darwin's Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design, by Stephen C. Meyer? If not, I would recommend you consider it. Dr. Meyer has made a significant contribution to the theory of intelligent design and points out the problems with the theory of evolution. Natural selection and mutation cannot possibly explain the abrupt appearance of sophisticated organisms without any precursors as seen in the Cambrian Explosion first found in Wales.While Charles Darwin is to be credited for his attempt to explain the diversity of living forms, he himself had doubts as to his theory.Molecular biology and the human genome project do much to render the theory of evolution - on its own - a myth.The requirement of extensive information for each new living organism indicates the necessity of intelligence to create the new organism. To quote Dr. Meyer, \"the discovery of digital information in even the simplest living cells indicates the prior activity of a designing intelligence at work in the origin of first life.\"The theologian and paleontologist Father Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, in his profound text \"The Phenomenon of Man,\" combined the two concepts to support evolution in the light of intelligent design. He saw evolution as a means for God's creation of life.As with the phenomena of near-death experiences, science and religion are not opposed to each other but meet in the end.God's Not Dead is not a perfect movie. But God's Not Dead does much to bring the discussion of the origin of life to the fore, and deserves credit for such an erudite presentation of the subject.Above all, the movie is inspirational, for it portrays a young man who has the courage to stand up for his Christian faith.",

            "content": "Before anything else, I'd like to mention that I am Christian--that is my perspective.'God's Not Dead' conveys a good message to share to those who are non- believers, yes. However, I am rating this movie mid-way because of its obvious biases.It's true, as Christians, we do want to spread the good news to those who have never heard of it, to those who don't believe it, and to those who don't believe it enough. But the filmmakers have forgotten that the message they aim to pursue is not for Christians who want to be better Christians, but to those who are similar to the characters they've released to be simply awful people.In my personal view, the film had several chances of improving:a) The many strands of subplots should have intertwined in a more dynamic area in the main through-line instead of a side event (in this movie's case, the Newsboys concert). For example, maybe the Muslim girl could have also been in Josh's class. Or perhaps the reporter had to interview the kid that so boldly stepped across the line of his philosophy professor. Just something to make me remember that there's a main character in which the plot revolves around. b) Character development. Yes, I stand on Josh Wheaton's side of the argument. But no, I almost didn't care if he won it or not. There were no points of peril--or hints that may show that his goal as a main character has a chance of failure; it almost seemed impossible for him to lose the battle. c) The professor in the film said there were \"moral atheists\", which I believe are there, but not it this film, They've fantastically made a way for the non-believer characters to look like class-A sociopaths. d) The clich\u00e9 verse lines do tend to make the script a little cumbersome. The producers and writers have to remember they shouldn't be shoving Jesus down into everyone's throats.That's my review. Christian filmmakers, in my opinion, should always avoid the 'Christians are awesome and everyone else is simply terrible' type of message and never forget to respect others' religions. Overall, I did like the message of God being there, alive by all means, and how Jesus can work through the lives of people--although I still hope there would be a slightly less offensive, better written film that can make that work.",

This movie also portrayed Christian as being persecuted by Atheist even though Christian is is the majority in America. Then this movie portrays the Atheist motive for being Atheist because they hate God since the Atheist blames God for the death of their loved one. People became Atheist because in their eyes there is no evidence for the existence of God, not because they hate God. Instead of having a debate for the existence of God in a philosophical manner, but instead all we have is over an hour of: \"You Are An Atheist Because You Hate God,\" \"Yeah, I became an Atheist is because God killed my loved one.\" If you want to see a movie with Christian theme and isn't in your face about it I would recommend watching Narnia or Lord of The Rings.",

Unfortunately the film was bogged down by subplot after subplot to the point where the original plot was lost in a sea of mediocre writing and possibly offensive portrayals of non-Christians. The subplots truly do run the show only giving a little bit of time to explore the main characters journey, I'm even debating whether to even call Shane Harper's character the main character or if i should share that title to the professor's girlfriend, the two quirky preachers, or the Newsboys all of which feature just (if not more) prominently than our college freshman. Also I should probably mention that there is one subplot that features a convert from Islam to Christianity that is both completely pointless and possibly offensive. I do not believe the director or writers were trying to offensive but it kinda comes of that way. The acting was good, I feel like I should point that out because independent movies like this can't always pull in the best actors but our two leads do a good job with the poor script they are given. Also the scenes involving the debate are very good and the best parts of the movie, if only they could have been the focus and not seven other stories shoe-horned in.",

If you are uninteresting and neuter about the issue of God see it as a movie to kill your time. If you are an atheist....Well it depends of your character. You will laugh a lot or you will get furious.The following is my opinion and may contains *SPOILERS*This movie is bad written and suffers from character development. Firstly the philosophy professor does not teach philosophy by saying to his students that God's dead. That's contradicts the ideology of philosophy! And the arguments of the discussion are just quotes from famous people like Dawkins and Hawkings who they are not philosophers. The girlfriend of the protagonist is whining to him because of the challenge he has to face with the professor and finally breaks up with him, as if this was a big deal! Dean Cain is presented as a cruel business man or something who puts his carrier first and breaks up with his girlfriend when he finds out she has cancer. He is an evil atheist of course. The girlfriend of Dean Cain who is a journalist takes an interview from a TV show hunter. When she asks him (with an aggressive tone) about the killings of the Innocent animals that he commits, he responded that he kills the animals only for the food and that life is temporarily and that Jesus is internal. After this, she leaves with a satisfying smile on her face as if she was saying \"ok,that's a good guy eventually\". The Japanese guy and the Muslim girl change their religion and beliefs because of the protagonist's lecture?... I don't know!By watching this movie you realize from the start that it doesn't cares about the story or the characters, but only for the blatant message. You can tell that especially by the ending. What happened with the journalist who had cancer? Did she die or not? Dean Cain found Jesus or not? What about the Muslim girl? Did she make out with the protagonist? What a about the professors wife? Did the Japanese guy get along with his father? It just ends ups with a lame concert and a message that God is awesome and everything and everybody is fine. Another problem in the film is the title. It should have been \"Jesus is not Dead\" or \"Christianity in America is not dead. It would have been more wise if the movie was about debating the issue of the existence of God in a philosophical way, rather that the straight message that Christianity is the closest thing to truth.This movie is disgrace! It's cheesy, lame, poor, shallow, preachy, egoistic, and a direct propaganda that defines the spirit of filmmaking.",

In our University we had a law professor start his term, asking the Christians in the class to identify themselves with a raised hand, he then stated that he would make it his objective to disprove their faith! Both my husband and I experienced Law, Philosophy, English, Sociology, Psychology, and Biology, professors who publicly degraded and disrespected, the Christian view. We live in a country with stated freedom of speech but that freedom is not applicable to Christians. As a student trying to obtain good grades it is very difficult to fight this kind of discrimination. Research the controversy in the Courts of a Canadian West Coast Christian University trying to get accreditation for a Law school. The high box office revenues for God's not dead, while being shown at few theatres is indicative of the popularity and truth of this movie. I highly recommend this movie.",

            "content": "Quite simply, I enjoyed this movie, the stories, the acting, the messages and the music. It is a constant challenge to find movies with ethical and/or religious teachings and even more difficult to find ones that are uplifting. Most have very low budgets, so I am prone to cutting a lot of slack for films in this genre. It makes little sense to rate these films against high-budget blockbuster films of a different genre. IMHO, the lower funding reflects how little we value such topics. The ills of society reflect the decline of ethical teachings and the current religious intolerance. Showing Christian faith is taboo and God forbid one should do anything that might offend atheists or minorities. Lawsuits abound and SCOTUS has shown difficulty dealing with these issues. Don't speak about faith, don't teach faith for fear of being mocked, ridiculed or fired. At least this is something I can watch with my niece. For me, this is mere charming relaxation, but for children can validate and reinforce valuable lessons. Kids no longer learn values in school. Critical thinking seems to also be on the decline. One thing I liked about this movie was the challenge with the professor. So many parrot popular tweets, trends and shallow news stories. I challenge myself and others to research everything, verify facts, understand all sides, accept there are unknown variables, evaluate, discuss, determine true value via cost/benefit analysis and perpetuate curiosity and learning. In this regard, I found the students commitment to his beliefs against authority a valuable message for younger people. That kind of commitment breeds healthy confidence since it is based on critical thinking rather than ego. It seems critical thinking just seems to be too much work for some people. The spoon-fed approved teaching and news bites diminishes our capacity to think for ourselves, grow and gain wisdom. The lazy way breeds complacency allowing evil to prevail while we do nothing. So, who am I to talk? Constant student of world economics, public policy, history, societies and religion. As a news hawk, I am thrilled to find a film like this to renew my faith at the end of the day. I am a Christian and am happier having faith in my life. I am sure I have offended a few, so now I am going to get back to my email to my Muslim \"brother\" in Egypt, who is more concerned about Christians in NA and ME than most Christians and Americans. Please do send me your recommendations for faith based movies!",

God will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths God will guide them; he will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things God will do; he will not forsake them. When you have to make a hard decision and you are in the dark about what to do, God will shine his light on the situation so the answer will be clear. When you see everyone else headed down a dark, dead-end ally, stop!Don't go there. God will be the light that leads you in the right direction. When you feel unpopular for taking a stand and the going gets rough, God will show up to smooth the path under your feet.",

            "content": "I finally sated my curiosity about this film. (Almost went to it in the theater but waited until last night to watch it on Amazon.) An intelligent premise went downhill pretty fast. The back and forth arguments between the freshman and the professor were good at first but the freshman finally hung (and hanged) his argument on the same fallacy for which he rightly criticized Stephen Hawking: Something set the universe in motion because something could set the universe in motion. In the context of this movie, the professor was an unlikeable character who was finally unmasked as being motivated by understandable tragedy and disappointment in life. Some atheists are not lapsed Christians, however.To the facile argument that if there is no God then everything is permissible, Penn Gillette has argued that he has already raped and murdered all people he wants to, and the number is zero. Atheists not only can be but usually are motivated by a high moral code.BTW: Why is an intro to philosophy designated as 150? Maybe that's the way they roll at some universities, but at mine it was 101.I found myself wondering why every other character is a Christian. Especially paired characters like brother-sister, boyfriend-girlfriend are atheist-theist\u2014or, rather, as it turns out, lapsed theist-theist.I did think there are some good arguments and good scenes, especially the one where Dean Cain's character asks his mother why she has been good but has Alzheimer's while he has been bad and is healthy and secure. (My own thought was, \"She's older than you; give it time and you'll have your problems\".) But I liked her answer a lot.I hadn't read any reviews or spoilers before seeing \"God's Not Dead\", and didn't know about the ending. Give me a break. Lapsed Christians must die rather than get a chance for a second act. Besides that, I thought that Dave and Jude, the two men of God, were too blas\u00e9 about death taking place in front of them. It is one thing to believe in an afterlife, another to be flippant about pain and death. One of them says something like, \"His pain was brief\". I'm sure that that's always a comfort when two seconds of intense pain can seem like an eternity. BTW, I had to wonder why these two men of God never bothered to ask how the man who delivered their rental car was going to get home or back to his office. Not to mention the whole business about the cars that only die for Pastor Dave. (Does the car rental guy who drives them over have to call a tow truck or do they start for him?) The whole subplot becomes a little too Deus ex machina.The Muslim versus Christian subplot pointed up how loaded this movie is with too many subplots to do them justice. If this were a work in progress it would need more.No wonder the bottle of wine went bad in Mina's car trunk. The movie was shot in Louisiana! But while I can understand her leaving wine in her car, I can't accept her leaving it in the trunk. She should be shot, but not before her boyfriend and his cronies are lined up against the wall, too. Merlot? The '80s called and they want your trendiness back.",

But this movie ...I mean, to depict God as someone who needs to be defended, to depict Christians as perfect people, and to generalize all atheists as bigots ...just doesn't make any sense from a biblical perspective. God is sovereign, Christians (and all other people) are imperfect, not all unbelievers are blatant douchebags. So with that said, here's my question to the director, producers, and distributors of this film: Where is the love, respect, and compassion that Christians are to have for the lost? Where is the love, respect, and honor that we are to have for our God?\n \n Sure, most atheists who dislike Christianity dislike it because of a bad experience they had with the church or with (a) Christian(s). But that's the problem isn't it? Their understanding of Christ is further muddied because they're taught that Christians have no respect for anyone outside of the faith. Is it not our job as Christians to represent Christ to the world? Are we not to be without excuse when our accusers accuse us? Christ was patient, Christ was kind, He was not envious, He did not boast, Christ was not proud. Christ wasn't rude, He wasn't self-seeking, and wasn't easily angered. So what makes us think we're to be any different? \n \n Personally, I'm angry that my Heavenly Father is disrespected and His grace cheapened by men of the cloth who make these kinds of media forms, who claim that they have knowledge and understanding of God and scripture, yet show by their work that they are more interested in driving away more unbelievers from the truth, while teaching believers false propaganda that encourages them to be unsociable, hateful, narcissistic, bullies. I mean, sure, all believers are at different stages of their walk, but should we not all have and exhibit the base foundation of those basic characteristics of Christ? Should the immature in Christ not display Christian love simply because they're immature? Of course not!\n \n Stop giving us this plastic gospel and give us the real thing, for heaven's sake! Take off the safety jacket, PureFlix, please! Show the real gospel; real scripture in it's real context. Give us real people; real believers, real unbelievers; depict them in real situations, with real struggles, with real needs, and with real heart felt pain and love. Show us what a true and false conversion looks like. Show the world the joy of following Jesus and putting sin to death.

The reason - just so you can slam it down and try to drive your lame point across that there is no God. I've even read some reviews by people who claim to be Christian or even pastors. I can't believe that at all. Anyone (atheist or otherwise)can claim they are anything, since it can't be verified. I have not met any Christian who as seen this movie who said they didn't like it. To address some specifics. Reviewer claim - No college tries to coerce students to denounce God. Quite the contrary. Liberal (atheist professors) try to do this all the time, not only religion, but politics as well. They know the unique position they have in controlling the young people. It's called \"indoctrination.\" Remember Hitler? Second claim - Atheist don't try to sway believers or control their beliefs. Do they not watch the news. Atheists constantly try to control believers actions. That's why there is no longer prayer is school. They try to have crosses brought down from display, even things like getting stores to stop saying \"Merry Christmas.\" So don't try to tell me they're passive. This movie is well made and acted. It's intent is obvious, but if you don't want to be offended - DON'T WATCH IT!!! If I'm not interested in a particular movie, I don't, like anything by that goofus buffoon (atheist), Michael Moore. It's also refreshing to watch a movie that has no violence, sex or cursing in it - at all! Maybe, that's what these reviewers want to see. Not everyone lives in the gutter.",

No amount of work we could do would ever wash you free of sin and make you righteous in Gods eyes. Ephesians 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast. Jesus lived a life that you & I can not (a life free of sin), died the death that you & I deserve (To pay the wage of our sin with His blood)He became sin for us, so that we might be declared righteous through Him. Because He suffered what we deserved, He redeemed us from the curse of the law. \"The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him.\" Because He suffered death, we can enjoy peace with God. Because it is through the cross that Jesus won victory over enemy powers, including Satan, sin and death. Their claim on us has been fully satisfied in the death of the innocent victim. They cannot demand any more than what He has already paid. As sin entered the world through one man, so was it removed by one man. John 19:30 When He had received the drink, Jesus said, \"It is finished.\" With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.By putting your faith and trust in our Lord Jesus Christ you are made righteous in the eyes of God and you are saved! That my friends is the gospel. You are free to take it or leave it. I will pray for you either way and love you as I have been so loved. A P.S. to my atheist friends. I was standing in your shoes for almost the whole of my life. It wasn't until I dared to humble myself enough to receive what God had placed in me upon the creation of my soul (That is the truth of His existence)that I came to know my salvation. I didn't find my answers in a book or words of another. It was in solitude, without the Word and without a church. I prayed to Him to reveal to me His heart and mine. I surrendered myself and asked Him to show Himself to me and there He was waiting for me. He is there waiting for you too and I believe you know it as well as I did. With all humility seek Him and you will find Him. True Christianity is not a religion. It is a relationship with Christ for your salvation that requires nothing but your faith and trust in Him to have. God Bless you all and peace be with you...",

            "content": "I am a philosophy professor and one of the courses I teach is philosophy of religion. I am not a Christian but I am also not an atheist (yes, there ARE other options!). I love a fascinating field study of human belief. This film and the reaction to it gives us just that.This film is an interesting mix of poignant accuracy and jaw-dropping inaccuracy. I suspect, given the past works of the writers and directors, the inaccuracies are intentional and the accuracies accidental but all combine to give us an insight into human nature though probably not what they intended.What this film portrays is a battle of closed-minded bigotries: the bigotry of Fundamentalist Christianity versus the bigotry of Fundamentalist Atheism. And the film actually portrays that silly battle somewhat realistically. The bigotry of Professor Radisson is not a simplistic caricature. I work with people like him and most of the lines he says are words I have heard spoken by real life Atheists who imagine themselves intellectuals. Not that every word put in the character's mouth is accurate--no philosophy professor would tell their students they must believe god is dead (though I know a biology professor who does demand that of his students). Also, the one scene where the professor chases after and forcibly puts his hands on the student and says he is out to get him is completely unrealistic. Yes, some Atheist academics are pathetically arrogant, condescending, and unthinkingly simplistic but the plot device of the evil professor battling with the student is ridiculous melodrama. The reaction of the student, just as bigoted as his professor, is also not caricature in that Fundamentalist Christians really are that naive and simplistic in their worldview. The scene with one of the Duck Dynasty guys is eye-opening in showing how unthinkingly simplistic such people view things--he does not have faith he has the same arrogance and condescension Professor Radisson has. Fundamentalists see the world as a black-and-white good-vs-evil battle and the film accurately portrays that worldview. The film bears no resemblance to real life, especially university life, but is is an accurate portrayal of both how Fundamentalist Christians and Fundamentalists Atheists view things. That's the sick irony--the Atheists like Professor Radisson are fighting that same silly battle of bigotries that the evangelicals are: \"you're stupid and in denial\" \"no, YOU'RE stupid and in denial.\" This debate does go on in the world (see the reviews of this film for examples) but it does not go on in universities and never in philosophy classrooms where we prize critical thinking and real discussion.That's the real problem with this film: it doesn't understand what philosophical discussion is. It mistakenly things \"you're stupid, no you're stupid\" is intellectual debate. That is what happens in Internet forums like this, not what happens in university classrooms. The film itself is philosophically simplistic. As I said earlier, there ARE other options than Christianity or Atheism (literally thousands) but this film is oblivious to these realities. It acts like there is only one kind of Christian and everyone else wants to be that but lacks the courage to be this one kind of Christian. This mirrors the attitude of Fundamentalist Atheists who think there are only Atheists and those who lack the courage to be Atheists.But again, that is a realistic portrayal of how Fundamentalist Christians and Fundamentalist Atheists think and act. It just isn't how people outside this petty battle of bigots think and act. The value of the film is as a dramatic set piece that gives you a peek into this Christian-vs-Atheist good-vs-evil subculture. And if you think it is only the film makers who think this simplistically, look at any atheist literature. Both sides are engaged in this childish fight thinking there are no other options. This film is a window into that warped world, just don't believe it is the real world.",

            "content": "Okay.... First of all, I know the difference between philosophy and theology. Philosophy is when I ask a question that no one can rightly answer. If it can be answered, it isn't philosophical. It becomes something else. Theology is when I give an answer that no one can question. If I were to question it, it no longer is a matter of faith. It cannot be trusted. Now, other definitions. Theist is someone who believes in the existence of God. Atheist is someone who believes in the non-existence of God. Can a theist be mad at God? Sure! Can an atheist be mad at God? Nope. In order to be mad at someone, you must believe that person exists. Why would an atheist be mad at someone he or she does not believe exists? An atheist would as soon be mad at a unicorn.I'm telling you, there is no atheist in this movie. The \"atheist\" here loses his argument simply because he is angry with God? That man was a theist alright! A true believer! Yet in the end, God kills him. Go figure!I didn't sleep through the movie, like I have with some others. This was a movie that made some philosophical points, but it is more \"under the table\" theology being passed as philosophy, because there was very little questioning the answers. But the film left me wondering, \"What the hell???\"",

            "content": "I am a Christian. I love my God. I've also studied philosophy. Therefore, I hated the movie \"God is not dead\". It did present some superficial evidence for the existence of God, but nothing substantive because there just isn't time in a movie. Why didn't I like it (well actually I enjoyed it in a sort of plan 9 from outer space way)? 1. It relied heavily on straw-man tactics by having the \"brilliant\" professor make arguments no self-respecting Atheist with 2 brain cells to rub together would ever make. I'm sorry, but there are intelligent Atheists - you might have thought the movie was good if you have never met one & thought this was really the best portrayal of an intelligent Atheist.2. The premise of the movie was comically unrealistic. A prof hates God & doesn't want to talk about it? I'm sorry, every person I've ever met like that loves to talk about it. He gives a Christian a voice in the class? He doesn't bother to counter the evidence provided except for one time (making an obvious logical fallacy). Not one other person refuses to write \"God is dead\" even anonymously? 3. In fact, the whole plot is a series of unrealistic situations. It seems the writers had an end in mind but no idea how reasonable people & events could possibly lead there. Every person in the class who earlier was willing to state \"God is dead\" stands in agreement at the end that \"God is not dead\" (except one holdout I think I saw). \"Smart\" prof walks into obvious set-up (\"why do you hate God?\"). Prof completely loses control of his class with nothing to gain. Also the prof gives an unfair & obviously biased assignment that could end up getting him fired. Prof's relationship with his girlfriend is not believable. And my favourite; what do you do when you've just convinced a room full of people that God is real? Run away! They'll probably find Jesus now right? 4. No research went into the Muslim family. The girl's family is strict enough that she has to wear the hijab, but apparently a low neckline is OK, nor is she concerned that her dad might show up 20 seconds early & see her putting it on in public, nor does she actually know how to wear it properly, awkwardly wrapping it like a scarf. 20 minutes on Wikipedia could have solved all these problems (except putting it on in public; that's just common sense). Also, due to lazy writing, she not only listens to the Bible while she sleeps, but her phone has no power saving feature that every phone has which would have made it go black. Also she has a Bible on her phone... with a strict father... what are the chances he would ever look at her phone? Like 120%? 5. Characters have no depth & there are too many of them. Every character is one dimensional & a caricature. Virtually the only development anyone makes is to get saved. Why is the Muslim girl even in this story? Why are the pastor & missionary in it? 6. A pastor has nothing to do but doesn't want to talk with someone about their problems. Do you know any pastor like that? Neither do I.7. This was a big one. The dude's girlfriend is going to ruin his life. She is a b*&%^ from hell. He figures this out, but still takes her back. She didn't change - she only came back because his life didn't fall apart like she thought it was going to.8. The clich\u00e9 ending. We all knew it was coming, but just in case they whipped it out & slapped us all in the face with it.I am not aware of any major apologetics organization that endorsed this movie. This movie was offensive towards non-Christians. Please do not invite a non-Christian friend to watch it with you. In fact, it was offensive towards Christians. We need to demand better. Don't support this kind of garbage just because it claims to be Christian. People will continue to make garbage products because Christians will buy garbage if it has a cross on it. Stop it!

            "content": "This movie is a literal offense to human intellect. As a person who enjoys debates, especially about religion, and is very tolerant about all kinds of theories and ways you can perceive life, I can still honestly say this is the most simplified and biased movie I've seen in my life. I'm literally speechless and am writing this for a long time already because I'm lacking the words to describe such ignorance...1) The movie is based on stereotypes and shows a wrong picture about absolutely everything, theists, atheists, agnostics, a Chinese family etc. I won't even start writing examples because it would be way too long, you just have to watch the movie to at least laugh.2) While the first point makes the movie only stupid, this second point is what actually makes the movie offensive. First of all, the debate starts by showing the teacher ( atheist ) as an a**hole, acting as a god who forces students into being atheists ( who is by the way and atheist because his mom died when he was 12, honestly i know no atheist that became an atheist because of such things, only the other way around, people who became theists for the same reason), every student in the class as idiots and the one student ( theist ) as a perfect, tolerant kid who stands up for himself and so on, you get the character type. In the beginning, the only arguments the teacher has are arguments based on what Stephen Hawking said and based on the theory of evolution... and how god is unnecessary if we have science and how all the great physicians were atheists and so on, and then comes in the kid with an argument which of course blows up his \"arguments\" and it is:\" Stephen Hawking said that philosophy is dead, in which case, if you follow everything Hawking says then this is obviously pointless, right?\". Just making an example of how the atheist is shown as an idiot. As the debate slowly comes down to an end, the final debate scene is about morality. While the kid is talking all about morality and how can we differentiate good from evil and who, if not god, even gave us the ability to do so, the teacher stands still and is shown as scared, cornered, again, has no arguments and almost bursts up in tears as he is being crushed by the kid, metaphorically. Now the best part in the script. The kid says something like this:\" The only thing that differentiates you and me in this debate is that you are forcing your students to declare themselves as atheists while I'm giving them a choice.\"The only thing that kid was doing the whole debate is forcibly saying that the thin line between good and evil leads directly to god etc. giving the students absolutely no chance to even consider other possibilities (and of course the teacher was still just standing almost crying with no arguments or at least open minded commentary about all kinds of possibilities, which would be at least nice ).No words, I'm simply offended by this, either ignorance or intentional hypocrisy, I don't know what it is. Personally, I'm an anti-theist but I support the idea of religion because it's something people need, most of us can't comprehend that maybe, only possibly we don't have an answer to as big of a question as this is, and that is normal. But then again, I don't need it, I can live fine understanding that the human race is gravely limited in the ways we perceive life and that we can't imagine something so scary as death and afterlife not having an answer. If answer to all life and universe is as simple as \"God\", then why do we even bother trying to understand the universe further ?! I believe in exactly the opposite. I believe that we can't physically imagine something that is the answer to a great thing such as existentialism and we never will be. I'm saying this because I want to state that I am an atheist, the kind of that doesn't believe in God, but does believe in a greater force, so I guess I can't declare myself as neither a believer or a non-believer This deeper philosophy I went into is simply to prove that this movie is as offensive as I said, it being extremely superficial and covering absolutely nothing that we don't know, it only keeps putting questions that we can't have an answer to, and yet,it is still giving an answer- God.",

Appealing to highly simplistic (if not wrong) argument like: \"if God does not exist, then Everything is permissible\" is only the sign of not being aware of the literature (even an introductory text) regarding the moral argument for God.

It's how people's review proves this movie to stand true on what it was trying to bring to the audience attention. A simple message that boils down to is that we all have a choice. We make our own decisions and no one should take that away or belittle anyone for their beliefs. I see more and more people being bullied for following their faith and it's disappointing when one backs down out of fear of what others think. This was refreshing to see. A reminder not to ever lose faith. Now back to this movie, like many Christian movies it seemed a bit campy but what can you expect from a family friendly movie. The actors were moving in their roles. There's moments where tears will be shed. The debate was intriguing, can hear both sides trying to prove what can't be proved.

Of note includes \"Im going to enjoy failing you\" (in front of a full class as witness) and accosting the main character with \"Ill see to it you never get a law degree\" (really?). The 'us vs. them' mentality permeates the most angry modern Christian film in recent memory - highlights include a demented grandmother who cant remember her own name but enlightens us with her optimistic life's metaphoric philosophy, (life is a jail cell with the gate cracked open for accepting Christ, but if you miss the boat, to bad!), a godless sugar daddy who worships money, a Christ-ignorant communist, a professor who engages in a relationship with a just graduated student, a control freak girlfriend, a snark liberal reporter who gets cancer (they just had to throw the politics in there) and a traditional Muslim woman, who in a scene that could only be taken as offensive, is told by a radiant Christian gem \"you are beautiful, you don't need to wear this\" in regards to her head covering; because for those fighting the good fight, we all know who the true god is, and Muslims really don't worship Allah as adamantly as Christian's worship Christ. (could one imagine if the Muslim world made a film showing a imam removing a cross necklace from a Coptic Christian uttering the same words ...oh wait, the plight of the Christian communities in the middle east is on fox news every night). For added flavor there is an African missionary and shameless plugs for Franklin Graham, the Newsboys, and Duck Dynasty (filmed before or after the bigoted comments?). Its a propaganda film that preaches to the choir, Non Christians will not be swayed, atheists who thought they were getting a dose of debate will want their money back. Predictable; the student wins the debate (and the class over), while the liberal dies away from cancer, the Muslim woman upon listening to a televangelist wails \"Jesus Christ is my savior!\" as she is being beaten by her father, and our professor gets treated to a fatal car accident in which a preacher does not call 911 or yells for help in front of a bustling sports arena, but informs the man its his last chance to share his own religious beliefs. Im not sure what the message really is here, ranging from don't send your kids to college unless its Liberty or Bob Jones, to stand up to professors, or when your car stalls thats god talking. 2 stars for the 'a-ha moment' which does pack some punch \"how can you hate something that does not exist\", and Sorbos spirited performance. -the theater (salt lake city, of all places) had about 7 people in it; one in which said to me after as I walked to my car \"that was some movie\". Upon my casual gesture and walking quicker to my car more assertively \"Im going to tell all my friends\", I replied non aggressively \"I would too if there really were professors out there like that\". The 50 something year old man took offense and then told me, a doctoral student in my now 4th liberal campus, \"If you think this movie isn't a reflection of whats really going on you need to wake up and pay attention\". Had I wanted to escalate I would have just told him instead of waking up and paying attention Ill just text my friends \"gods not dead\".",

I believe different people have different perspectives to this movie - it's only natural atheists and the like would likely support Radisson and rate the movie as implicative of writing off people who don't believe in God; whilst Christians would see this movie as an apologia.On the bright side of my 8/10 rating, the message of the plot is simple and clear: a lone Christian student defending his faith in God against his atheist lecturer and in the presence of others who, perhaps are halting between opinions of the existence, or otherwise nonexistence of God. It's symbolic of very few true and faithful Christians in the world today ready to give up their lives for the gospel.\nThe actors did a good jobOn the other hand, the movie's short of my 2-star rating, firstly because of some unrelated, perhaps unfinished subplots. What happened to Ayisha who converted to Christianity after being disowned? Or, the lady with cancer: was she healed, or did she die like the professor? Speaking of the professor, I totally disagree with his demise in the movie. It's more like a tragedy to me because he died, and for it, I was almost indifferent for the remainder of the movie. There are other situations that could lead to his conversion but by an accident and resulting death. The healing of Amy after she was written off as slowly ebbing away can do it, in addition to the convicting impact already made by the freshman.\nThirdly, I disagree with the flat-out compliance by 99.9% of the class to renounce their faith for cheap passmark. Unless that city is a hometown of atheists, I don't understand why there was nobody else to stand by Wheaton in not writing the \"god is dead\" thing, even if they don't voice it out.Beyond these minor flaws, it is a great movie. I bet the producers don't realize the how convicting some lines in the script were. One of my favorite was: \"Sometimes the devil allows people to live a life free of trouble because he doesn't want them turning to God\" by Mina's mother.

Makes me wonder where his strong faith came from, if his parents would not support him to fight against the teacher.Josh is fighting for his cause, I would imagine this is symbolic of Jesus fighting the Romans.Josh has three 20 minute sessions to convince his class of \"about 80\" students that God is alive. The strength and courage of Josh is admirable and downright awesome. As a freshman in college, I had no idea what to believe in, and certainly not have the strength to challenge a tenured (my guess) professor. The progression is very sound. After the first session, Josh sees that Radisson is not going to sit idle. Radisson will be bringing his arsenal of knowledge so Josh has to bring is A+ game, just to stay afloat. The main story of Josh is the, excuse the pun, lifeblood of the movie. But there are a few side stories that bring me to my headline. All the characters are somehow connected. What was suppose to be a message for Christianity may have been discouraged and enraged some movie goes. It is worth noting is anyone who not Christian in this movie, is a not a nice person. They are portraying extreme roles ruthless, egotistical, vindictive, and cruel people. This was way over the top to hammer down the point that this is a Christian movie. Unfortunately, I thought this was over the top, and a blemish on an otherwise wholesome, positive movie.Despite the overtly Christian theme, I would recommend it to everyone. Yes it is about religion but it's not preaching it to you. The humanity of life, accepting ones responsibility and others, and to having the courage to fight for your beliefs is much more prevalent.As the movie closed, I was surprised at the ending. I thought I knew what was going to happen, and I was only partially right.Cast was very good for only two big names that aren't that big anymore.Question that I thought of:Were Dean Cain and Kevin Sorbo sought out because of their previous big roles? (Superman and Hercules, accordingly) Superman symbolizing an immortal type figure. And Hercules, half man half god. Continuity issue: Josh scheduled and went to class on same day. He should have made his freshman schedule at an orientation. His outfit also changed.",

            "content": "I kinda wanted to see this in theaters, glad I saved my money\ud83d\ude00. It has an interesting concept, a Christian student who basically has to deny his belief, drop a class, or defend his position as a believer to the class of an atheist professor. If he fails to win the class, he essentially fails the class...bad for a pre law student...any student really... Anyway, nice concept but poor delivery, the main character and Kevin Sorbo(Hercules?) are not bad, but there is a lot of bad acting in this film....like painfully bad acting. I'm fairly sure the duck dynasty guy has his own show, he should be a little better, but maybe it was the limits of others....who knows. The characters other than the main guy are pretty one dimensional....bad boyfriend, hateful reporter, mean Muslim father. And they basically made everyone who was not Christian look downright ugly in character. Some of the debate scenes were not bad, I was curious about some of the references, I may have to look them up. I have always wanted to read hawking but just have not worked up to it. But the guy came up with black holes, has to be interesting. But the rest of the movie just seemed pretty silly. The journalist especially. I am a Christian with more agnostic leanings I guess. In Texas it's hard not to get thumped by a bible on a regular basis, by this I mean that we have a lot of judgmental Christians. It's a little why I've rethought some of my beliefs, simply because I hear more hate. Against gays, pro choice, etc. but I also have several good friends who are very set in their beliefs and while we have discussions about such, they are not hateful, even when they believe otherwise, they do it in a way that is more worthy of the loving God that I believe in. So I'm not dissing the movie on the basis of its idea, I'm just not going to rate it as good, in what I like in a movie. So basics: pretty cheesy acting, dull characters for most, and a decent idea that got wasted in all the accessory people who really had no point in the movie except to get converted or whatever that one guy with the reverend was supposed to be doing...I missed that part I guess. Never did figure out who he was. The music wasn't bad- again musician guys- not good actors.",

It reminds you that you have to diePeople don't like being uncomfortable, so that makes them hate everything that God stands for. That's OK because only God can help those people. And don't be persuaded by the so called reviews by \"Christian\" haters. Their main concern is making themselves look good. God couldn't care less. What people don't realize is that the main goal of this film is NOT to necessarily entertain you, like most movies do today. It's to bring people to Christ, with a reminder that they won't live forever and there is Life after death. In this day and age everyone is so concerned that something might offend someone. Let's face it; Dying, Death and Hell are very offensive.

Our professor made a claim and then stated to a 400 person lecture hall that any Catholics in the room were brainwashed as children so their counter arguments were irrelevant. Coming from these similar experiences it was really uplifting to see this movie and the small things that can have an influence on people. It's not a movie out to change minds, but it perhaps brings awareness to the fact that Christians can actually face a bit of persecution on U.S. college campus's, which is really a shame.",

            "content": "Professor Raddison (Kevin Sorbo) gives an almost parallel performance to the sad reality of how the educational systems in America, with exception to private Christian colleges and schools. Overall teachers, willingly (or unwillingly), are attempting to manipulate our youth into questioning the existence of God, inhibit individuals from expressing their faith, and facilitating doubt in the minds of those trustingly eager to learn. Through my experience as a college student, I was subjected to these efforts of inculcation by \"free thinking\" instructors trying to use their \"professional power\" to teach without allowing student's the liberty to speak freely about their faith in God. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs, including Christians, and those rights shouldn't be dominated by an atheistic educational system that tries to control our constitutional rights to freedom of religion and speech as Raddison demonstrates in his attempt to dominate (bully) student Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper) in this film. There are professors like Raddison's character that exist (you must watch to understand). Likewise, the reality is that teacher's aren't allowed to speak freely about their Christian beliefs without reprimands from their school officials and administrators. This message needs to be voiced to all in hopes to aid in the awareness that GOD IS NOT DEAD and that there is so much good in the world because of that faith. However, as a Christian, I rated this film lower according to it's extremity of stereotypes and that not all of the characters portrayed are exact- but they exist. There are extremes (good and bad) in all categories in life. The movie does make generalizations of the worst scenarios of characters and they could have illustrated roles more clearly so that the message could make a stronger impact on everyone. Acceptance and non-judgment would have been a stronger message portrayed in this film and that is why I wrote a review to help you stay open minded that nobody is perfect, but unconditional love and acceptance is what the majority wants. As a college professor today, and being in the education industry for over 15 years, I have witnessed freedoms of faith being restricted for everyone and this is happening in the public school systems consistently, not to mention other industries. We all have free will and this is just the kind of movie that should be watched by believers, non-believers, atheists, theists, and anyone who is interested. Another option for a tagline could be 'Live and let live', after all it seems like we all just need to be open-minded to \"co-exist\", not judge others that are trying to find their own spiritual path and have overall happiness.",

But, college professors can be atheist, with some taking it a step further and being passively anti-God. But, as for the how the Muslim family is depicted, I am not surprised in any way. Sure, some Muslims can be peaceful, but this does happen! In the USA but even worse overseas in the middle east. Those who chose to serve Christ there are killed and some mutilated in horrible ways. This movie is not propaganda, but it does portray non-Christians as horrible people. That is not true, but still, those people exist and they strive to give Christians a hard time like they did in the story here. Please give this movie a try, and ignore the cheesy acting at times and focus on the real message behind it. God is not Dead folks, and God bless:)",

            "content": "As a Christian, I came out of this movie with some mixed feelings. I generally enjoy those movies where you follow multiple story lines and they all end up being connected somehow in the end. But this time it was not wrapped up in any sort of clever or surprising way.On the technical aspects, I felt that some of the characters were underdeveloped and simplistic. The acting was OK in some cases, wooden in others, and over-the-top exquisite (Sorbo brought my rating up). Some of the scenes had potential, (especially the debate scenes), but again were lacking in dialog or emotion from how it was shot and staged.I fully expected from the outside of the DVD case that the debate would have been more of a real debate and discussion between a atheist professor and a God believing student (as an exercise). Instead, the professor came off unrealistic (at least in his behavior in the classroom and with others) and overly simplified in his beliefs, motivations, and demeanor. This \"extreme anti-theist\" viewpoint would have been better served by a supporting character (perhaps by a contemporary of the professor or another student in the class).There was also an unnecessary hard-line \"left-wing\" (anti-hunting? what does that have to do with God...deal with that in a sequel) character that just had no place in the movie at the level it was presented. I think this film would have been better served it it addressed a general view of does God exist thru the prism of all religions (Christian, Judism, Islam at least) rather than just Christian alone. I feel that it unnecessarily and unfairly portrayed Muslims as either being fundamentalist or closet Christians. What I did like? I did enjoy the fact that the Thiest view point did not rely totally on biblical scripture (i.e., no Ken Hamm the world is 6500 years old, Bible is 100% literal and Science be damned) to attempt to support their case. Sciencetific thought, ranging from evolution, the geological record, the Big Bang theory, as well as theological musings by Theist (and Atheist/Agnostic) scientists all were presented as not being in any great and absolute conflict with the idea of a Creator (i.e., I can be a Scientist and acknowledge that the earth is $ Billion Years old and still believe in God and take value from Theism and the Bible, Torah, Kuran, etc. However, the Atheist view point was always over simplified and compromised by the extreme behavior of the professor.It would have been a much better movie if the Athiest professor's first day demand of the class was an ruse/exercise (to demonstrate that he could get the students to compromise their beliefs so easily), this would lead to a general debate between the professor and some holdout Theist students (represented by a diverse background of religions...the Big 3 maybe) that evolves into a challenge to debate it in front of the class. Some of the extreme Christian, Islamic, Athiest stances can be demonstrated by peripheral characters (snarky Athiest Vegans, to traditional Muslims, to abusive Christians) and explore how the main characters interact within each of their viewpoints (via family, friends, everyday interactions). The Athiest professor could have still been married to a Theist wife and explored how that could work. The Christian kid could have had a \"Bible-Thumping\" Ken Hamm type dad, the Muslim girl could have had a borderline fundamentalist teenage brother. And then in the end, each side of the debate has presented it case and we, the audience, Theist and Athiest alike, are better educated as to why the opposite believes what they believe and that the free exchange of ideas without hostility is what we should strive for, especially in a scholarly setting. And as Kevin Smith says, \"Credits.\"",

The ominous music when the professor came on screen coupled with the angles that made him look like a comic book villain were too much. We laughed at all the breakup scenes (there are a lot of them) and the completely ridiculous ending. The slow motion shots were a great touch if one wanted to make it funny instead of serious. The writer and director of this film were clearly disconnected from reality.I'm giving this film a 5 because the movie was shot very well, the acting was good in spite of the material, and a few interesting points did come up. That's enough to give it a 5, I think. But the stereotypical jerk atheists were way overdone. Few atheists actually act like this. The Muslim stereotypes are offensive (my friend lives with a Muslim family and they would never act like that). A lot of the dialogue is rather forced. I think this was a really good premise for a movie and had it been done right, it would be very thought provoking. As is, it has some decent ideas but it doesn't expand on them very much. It provides very little alternative point of view.As a Christian, I really wish my fellow Christians could figure out how to make a decent film that won't offend people this much.

They were not saying that every atheists is mean, just some of them are. How else do you explain the teachers who take away people Bibles and say that it's not 'school appropriate', or make churches take down crosses they plant in front of churches, or make parents take down crosses that they planted where their kid was killed in a car accident or hit by a car, and don't forget they\\ two Christians who were starting a T.V. show and it wouldn't air because it was Christian based.

It's so bias and manipulative in how it portrays atheists. Not every atheist is bitter and cynical, it's all about proof really. Something this movie and the makers fail to understand.The story centers around a college student who challenges his teacher's (Kevin Sorbo) beliefs about god. A devoted Christian, he sets out to prove that god is real. This in turn inspires his classmates to question their beliefs in the process. He also loses his girlfriend only to get another one.While it doesn't seem bad on the paper, how it's presented on screen is a different story. Even if this wasn't a Christian film, It's still terrible movie. The characters are mostly stereotypes that've been done to death such as the abusive Muslim dad, the quiet, obedient straight-A Chinese student, and the main character who's the typical boy next door which's fine but he is also very plain and as much as I like Kevin Sorbo, his role as the one-dimensional antagonist just doesn't cut it. I'm actually concerned that it'll distort people's perception of atheists. In a way, they already have it rough and this only further aggravates it.The songs aren't bad though they're meh and the cameos are unnecessary. Some of the commentary is actually thought provoking and can be sweet but at the same time, I feel like it's a little forced. It's a shame Pureflix decided to release two more sequels to this abomination. That in it of itself is an affront to god. God teaches love and acceptance, something this movie turns its back on.I hate to sound religious but it's true. I have nothing against Christian movies and shows such as veggie tales (in fact I grew up watching it) but this's propaganda that can distort and turn people away rather than unite as the teachings are supposed to do.Whether you're a Christian or not, this isn't the movie for you. I dare say, this's blasphemous in how one-sided it is. I don't have much else to say other than skip it. While it's not bad enough to be condemned, it's enough to shun it.",

I'd file it away as another piece of propaganda that Christians watch just cause there's God in it, and walk away.However, for one, it is popular. And apart from that, it tackles the topic of Christianity vs atheism in such an absurd manner that it baffles me some people actually concluded: \"Damn, that was insightful\" after seeing it.I know of such people first-hand. My family did just that.THE PLOT: Josh believes in God. He enters college. His philosophy professor is an atheist and he demands that all his students renounce religion (What The Hell?). Josh refuses; the professor challenges him for a series of debates on the topic.Sounds interesting, eh? This could have been a good premise. But this is propaganda, so you know how it goes. Every atheist character either ends badly, or converts, or turns out not to have been an atheist at all! Yeah, you read it well. Apparently for the film creators the only conceivable reason for calling yourself an atheist is that a) this terrible demoralized Western world has pushed you off track, b) you're just angry with God and giving him the cold shoulder.The debates Josh has with the professor are ridiculous. Josh's arguments basically rely on some romantic notions like, and I quote, \"The unimaginably intense flash of light during the Big Bang was how you could expect the universe to react to God's command of 'Let there be light.'\". Is this serious? And the man who is supposed to be a philosophy professor actually takes it as such and eventually embraces faith.It's maddening to me since I've watched hundreds of Christian vs atheist debates and I know how most atheist intellectuals would *really* react to such arguments. These people are relentlessly rational, whether you like that approach or not. You can hardly sway them with half-assed metaphysical rambling. They'd laugh in your face and recite a list of logical fallacies you've just committed.Anyway, of course it's just a movie, it can make whatever claims it wants. But if you want more nuanced perspective on atheism vs Christianity, go watch some Dawkins, both the Hitchens brothers, and throw in some Jordan Peterson for good measure. This film will do you no favors.",

            "content": "...But it's very, very hard to. I really had no interest in seeing this movie but sat down with my oldest daughter to watch it since she said she was interested. Keep an open mind, I thought. As a believer, I have to admit I struggle with so-called \"Christian\" movies. Clearly a movie called \"God's Not Dead\" intends to be heavy- and ham-handed about its message. It was fated to be transparently faux inspirational, to stir hearts and minds with its flimsy and lightweight plot and story. \"God's Not Dead,\" about a Christian college student going tete-a- tete with a learned, literate Atheist philosophy professor to theoretically defend the proposition that God is, indeed, not dead - something the professor, played by the fairly unremarkable Hercules, Kevin Sorbo, apparently resigned to these kinds of roles, wants to force all students in his class to commit to, lest they waste their time concerned with the \"problem\" of God. Instead, he and the Christian student, played by Shane Harper, get into a somewhat milquetoast attempt at an apologetic debate over the existence of a divine creator. Giving the student 3 20 minute sessions to convince the other students that God is not dead, the professor starts to slither away from the debate somewhat early in the process - by the 2nd debate he's kind of checked out from serious argument. He never seems to put up a particularly convincing fight and seems to devolve into more of a God-hating caricature than someone seriously debating the nature and existence of God.As a committed believer I'm trying to determine what the creators of this film are driving at. As a non-believer or an Atheist would this film convince me that God is not dead? Certainly not. As a serious Christian apologist, would this film provide tangible argumentative fuel for me? Certainly not. As a Christian believer, would or should I find serious inspiration for my faith in the film's message? Not likely. See that's the problem with most \"Christian\" movies - they're trying too hard to be deliberately \"Christian,\" to be vaguely and self-consciously inspirational, and not trying particularly hard to be art. Art is hard. Art takes a serious, concentrated, thoughtful effort. In movies like this, like the much worse \"Facing the Giants\" (which basically has one very well done scene), the also worse \"Fireproof,\" they're grasping at a series of Christian film tropes. Ultimately it tends to come as cloying and impotent. Creating a serious Christian apologetical film would take far more intellectual firepower - from both the pro and contra sides of the aisle - than what's on display here and even if such firepower were accessible I'm not sure I'd see the point of a filmed debate, unless it were some kind of documentary. To make an artful film about why God exists needs an entirely different tack to be convincing. Being brute and heavy-handed with the material - again, very typical of Christian films - just leaves everything and everyone wanting. While I would say \"God's not Dead\" is better than most Christian films I've seen - and that's a pretty low bar admittedly - it's far from a touchstone representing a significant shift in it as a serious art form. The acting overall is better (Sorbo, Harper, Cain, and some others are generally what I'd call competent and sometimes more than competent; not standout great but competent) but there's still some excruciatingly bad amateurs in the mix - including some cast members of \"Duck Dynasty\" who are inexplicably present to muck things up (I'm guessing they chipped in some money to help finance the movie?). The Christian rockers the Newsboys also show up for the faux- inspirational denouement of the film, again somewhat inexplicable plot elements. These amateurs tend to be poison for Christian movies and make it even harder to take them all that seriously. I wish they'd try harder to cast professional actors. All in all, \"God's not Dead\" is bad, bordering on terrible, with a few minor good points. Rated relative to Christian movies, I'd call it borderline so- so. Decent acting with a dose of really bad acting, a weird and scattered plot, attempts at inspiration that just seem to miss, and a ham-handedness in how it deals with deep and powerful subject matter. Your time and money - as a Christian or not - is otherwise spent better elsewhere.",

Take it or leave it, we're all here to put our opinions out there for one reason or another. In some cases, the \"movie review\" is nothing more than an excuse to throw out philosophical ideas and take a big stinking dump on what others believe or treasure. It gets away from the point of reviewing a movie. I'm doing it, too here, I know that.I just watched this movie on Netflix. I was not so naive as to believe it was going to be strictly a rational scientific debate. I knew it was going to be a Christian oriented film and a bit preachy, but I was curious how they were going to go about the debate. I found it quite interesting. Sure I found myself wondering just where this kid found all the time to do all this research AND put together a really nice power point presentation while still juggling his other classes, but hey, it's only a movie, and hey, let's not forget that either people.The acting was pretty decent. Kevin Sorbo, Dean Cain and David A.R. White present the star power (somewhat) and each does a pretty decent and believable job, the first two as the not so nice guys and the third as the reliable good guy. Shane Harper does a terrific job as the University Student who is determined not to be bullied by his overbearing Stalinist professor and takes on the challenge to prove that God is NOT dead.The rest of the cast does their jobs, in a rather unspectacular way, but hey, in all honesty, it's a low budget movie, not a blockbuster. It does what it's supposed to do and why it was made; entertain and send a message. What is so hard to figure out about this? Some reviewers seem to feel that if movies are not 'in your face' with action and drama, they're not worth watching, or worse yet, if an idea is presented that they don't like, it's rubbish. Poppycock! Did I love this movie? Hell no, but just because it presents a strong view point that the PC crowd does not like does not make it a bad movie.I admit (like it's a bad thing?) that I'm a Catholic, but I'm pretty mediocre at it. I'm not a super Christian and I don't preach but I try to be good at it. My point? That doesn't mean I have to love or hate this movie (which is very Protestant, by the way.) and I watched it out of curiosity, as said before, and to be entertained. I was satisfied. That's all I can ask and it's all I got. Had it outraged me, I would have turned it off, walked out, changed the channel, what-have-you; Free Will. Sound familiar? For those who watched this and other similar movies then rant about the 'propaganda' aspect, well, shame on you for being so foolish to have watched it in the first place. If you were so stupid as to believe a Christian movie wasn't going to preach, you probably have to have your mashed potatoes cut for you before you eat them and even then get confused by the texture. If you didn't KNOW it was going to be a Christian movie, well, shame on you for not doing a little checking into this movie before being offended.Everyone is entitled to an opinion, even us pseudo-critics here on IMDb. (Face it, we're not really critics, we're average folks with an opinion, some here forget that.) I've watched \"Battleship Potemkin\" and didn't once get outraged at how pro-Communist it was. I'm smarter than that, and I'm certainly no genius.The movie got 5 stars from me because it's not a great movie, but it's far from a bad movie. That is all.",

He does realize it doesn't mean \"God was alive but is now dead.\" But instead he thinks it means that \"God never existed in the first place.\" The phrase, coined by Friedrich Nietzsche, means nothing of the sort and in fact has nothing to do with God's existence. Instead, Nietzsche was trying to argue that belief in God no longer affected how people live their lives; specifically, God was no longer used as a moral compass or a source of meaning: If only Radisson, and the makers of the film, had bothered with a four second Google search. If they had made the point of the film to refute that claim, then I might have been able to get on board. The mere fact that the movie was able to be made and appear in theaters clearly indicates that the idea of God still plays a significant role in many people's lives.Contrary to the entire essence of philosophy, Radisson comes to his philosophical conclusions for completely irrational and emotional reasons. He is an atheist not because he has evaluated the arguments and evidence, but because he's mad about his mom dying when he was 12. He converts in the end not because he was proved wrong, but because of a touching letter from his mother and because he is scared of death.Radisson is also in the habit of giving poor arguments from authority. Basically his argument for atheism consists of listing a few smart people who are atheists. This argument of course would stand for no longer than it took to list an equal number of smart people who are theists. Every philosopher knows that the existence of God is not something that can be settled by authority.In fact, it seems that the reason Radisson wants to skip the God section of his course is because he apparently skipped it himself. Despite the fact that he is a tenured philosopher (about to be appointed as his department's chair) who is hell bent on proving atheism, he is apparently unaware of any of the many philosophical arguments for atheism that exist. He does mention a conclusion of Steven Hawking, and a student mentions an argument from Dawkins\u2014but Hawking and Dawkins are both scientists. (As one who loves science, I'm a fan of both of their work\u2014but when they venture into philosophy, their arguments can fall short.) Radisson does assign Russell's \"Why I am not a Christian,\" but apparently he is not familiar with it himself\u2014along with the works of William Rowe, Michael Martin, Ricki Monnier, Julian Baggini, John Mackie, Quentin Smith and many others. Their arguments could easily be used to show the flaws in Josh's arguments, yet Radisson seems completely oblivious.",

I was hoping that I would learn something, but the many set-ups to present the sides are disingenuously false or honestly incomplete/ignorant. You can't win an argument by presenting a false/incomplete argument for the other side, and then bashing it down as if our side really was stronger. There were so many stronger and honestly genuine arguments that could have been presented for our side that could really have made a difference, but instead this movie hides under baby Christian notions. I further did not appreciated the cheap way out the movie took, as if all atheist don't believe in God because God failed them in the past (the professor is anti God because his mom died of cancer and God did not save her? Great minds can honestly differ in beliefs, and just because they do not believe like we do it does not mean that they have an unresolved psychological deficiency). To me, I understand the atheist for what they truly believe, and in addition to that, I can comfortably choose to have faith in God. I do not need to believe that the other side is defective or dysfunctional in order for them not to believe in God.Finally, the emotional manipulation of this movie is laid so thick, it is shameless. A woman finding out she has cancer and is abandoned by her boyfriend? a Muslim girl is beaten up by her fundamentalist Muslim father for choosing to believe in Jesus? A atheist is dying from a car accident, and the priest is more concerned about having the atheist accept God in 30 seconds rather than meeting the injured man wherever he is in his journey? How conceded and condescending! This is the Christian thing to do? My Jesus is humble and more powerful than these manipulations. Every Christian in this movie is a saint to a nausea, and every atheist is a defective human being worth only for saving/repentance. It is this kind of childish, intellectually soft, structurally dishonest, and emotionally manipulative preaching that drive the atheist further away from God. It is this kind of self congratulatory, self authorizing semi-truthful nonsense that keep Christians in the immature baby Christian stage. \"When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things\" - 1 Corinthians 13:11 (New Living Translation). It is time to grow up and fight for God as a grown up Christian. It does us more harm to rally behind anything Christian just because it is remotely Christian. It robs us from true Christian growth when we settle for misguided or dishonest Christian propaganda. PLEASE someone make an intellectually honest movie and present Jesus for the complex, advanced, sophisticated, intelligent, and loving God that He is. Both atheist and baby Christians would benefit from this.",

This is not some mushy touchy-feely \"faith based\" movie, but a movie with fictional characters presenting very real and hard evidence for why we believe in what we believe. Well done! I hope they make more movies that will expand on the scientific evidence and arguments supporting Creationism and uncovering the lies that have been taught in schools to our children (I being one of them).",

Some of the most hostile, antagonistic and hate-filled comments were from atheists. Atheists have bullied and badgered so many Christians, they make video after video raging at Christians.. they have B online \"TV shows\" that exist for the sole purpose of berating religion, more specifically Christianity. To be fair, there ARE some You Tube atheists that are kind and simply great people (ProfMTH for one... absolutely one of the nicest people you will ever encounter) but the VAST MAJORITY are angry and hate-filled. All that said, the way that the film depicted atheists was essentially spot on.I really wish I had watched this movie in the theaters. I plan to watch their next movie at the theater and pay my hard earned cash in support.All I can say is watch this movie for yourself. If you've ever debated with an atheist (I have) you'll see how incredibly accurate this movie really is.",

Congrats to the producers. They did a masterful job. It would be great if there was a way to reach the people who think they're intellectually superior to the average but I'm not sure thats possible.

It was surprisingly evocative, bringing me to near tears on a few occasions, but the unrealistic and biased portrayals ruined the movie for me. Spoilers: My first cringe was when the the professor turned out to be an asshole and it was all downhill from there. The next was when the girlfriend dumped the protagonist. Then the Muslim girl \"came out of the closet\" to her dad. After that they became too frequent to recall and the biased evangelism ruined the experience.",

            "content": "This is a mean-spirited movie, which takes an unbiblical approach in dealing with Atheists. It is quite offensive to them but not for the reason you might think. The Bible clearly teaches that God's Gospel (His good news) is naturally offensive to all unbelievers but as you will see in this movie, the makers of it have not accurately presented the Gospel at all. This movie lacks genuine love. True love would have presented the complete truth\u0085the complete message.At best, this is religious entertainment. However, is it Christian? I understand that it wears the label, but does it actually contain the true good new of God concerning what He has done through His Son in order to save humanity from their sin and from His wrath? Would anyone come away from this movie thinking, \"I need Jesus to rescue me?\" I want to point out to you the theme and purpose of this movie and that is\u2014everyone has a free will to choose. Modern day Christianity teaches this, but the question is\u2014does the Word of God teach it? The Bible speaks as follows; all of humanity is in bondage to the power of sin (Romans 3:23; 6:14: Galatians 3:22). It further states, \"A natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised (1 Corinthians 2:14, see also Romans 8:5-8). In Romans 5, humanity is said to be helpless, ungodly, sinners, under the wrath of God, and enemies of God. Ephesians 2:1-2 teaches that humanity is dead in trespasses and sins, and that it lives according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.\" Mankind is in bondage and therefore unable to set himself free. As a beggar he must plead to God for mercy.Who would sense their need to flee to Christ for salvation from Gods wrath after watching this film? It is through Christ and Christ alone that we escape the wrath to come (Romans 5:9).There is one thing I actually like about this movie and in pointing, it out it may be surprising to many of you, but there is only one Truth separating true Christianity from all world religions and that Truth is this\u2014Jesus is God. To its credit, this movie mentions this fact. (see John 1:1-14.) An NO ONE is saved apart from believing it. (see Romans 10:9) Sadly, millions of professing Christians miss the fact that this movie does not contain the Gospel of Jesus Christ nor does it inform people of their sinful condition before God that necessitates our need to be saved in the first place. Yes, it mentions a fragment of it. However, it is only a half-truth, which is powerless to save. The Apostle Paul spoke of the Gospel message in its entirety when he said; \"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared\u0085\" (1 Corinthians 15:3-5).When we watch a movie claiming to present the Truth of the Bible, we must be looking for \"Christ's death for our sins, His burial, and His resurrection. NO ONE is going to come away from this movie thinking he or she is already a condemned sinner before God? If I were an atheist, I would have ONE question for Christians, \"Why do I need Jesus?\" IF you are an atheist then you must hear that God in fact loves you. I know this because of Romans 5:6-8 and John 3:16\u0085 This is God's final word to you. \"\u0085God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.\" Acts 17:30-31 and Jesus says repent and believe in the gospel (Mark 1:15).

The movie pretty much spirals down from there, with the final blow being the so called atheist admitting he is mad at God. Check me if I'm wrong, but if he is mad at God, doesn't that mean that he was never an atheist to begin with?

In the end, all this movie does is attack the Atheist community without providing anything in the way of a strong argument proving the existence of God, while also being remarkably tone deaf.The performances by Kevin Sorbo and David AR White are absolutely... okay, at best. I think Studio Pureflix really, really wanted to provide a counterpoint to earlier successes like the film Religiosity as well as popular Youtube Atheist channels that provide far better arguments for Atheism than this series of films could ever hope to for Christianity or even just Theism.Basically, the movie is disgusting because it paints all Atheists as horrible people and sets its sights pretty low, story and plot-wise.God's not dead and its follow-up are laughable(in large part because of how terribly they are written), although I have heard the third movie in this series isn't nearly as terrible.",

Usually, there is not much acting happening, but more instructed actions that the director thought should be attached to the moment... but the moment is not reached. However, in this film, I did find that there was a little bit more acting happening here. My issue was with the protagonist's girlfriend. Her character is extremely under-developed and her actions are very abrupt; her attitude and frustrations are not quite justified. She has little defense for her decisions. Though I understand that she is not meant to be a like-able character, she is still lacking a reason to for why she does what she does. She presents a list of surface level issues she has, but they are far beyond selfish and she loses sight of her own faith in her frustration.",

            "content": "At the credits, you see that the movie was intended to show support for students and student groups around the country that are pursing legal action against their academic institutions for various infractions against their religious expression. Some of the scenes and writing seemed a bit over the top or hokey, to me. But it wasn't a large production. And if the movie's intent was to convey the personal feelings/struggle that an 18 year old kid would have, when confronted with inappropriate/borderline malicious treatment from someone in a position of authority, where the choice is either hurt yourself or hurt others and yourself; then I would say the movie did this very well.Other reviewer are correct, the movie is propaganda. But it's propaganda to let people that might feel as though they are in a similar situation to the main character, that they are not alone in the world, and that everything will be OK. It's a feel-good movie, in that sense. The point of the movie is that in the real world, the main character, Josh, should never have been put in that situation. And the movie offers hope to people that may identify with the character. I would have liked to have seen more in the way of the classroom debates; but, again, that didn't seem to be the overall focus of the movie. I though the movie did a good job of displaying several 'a-day-in-the-life-of' snapshots of people in their journeys through the world, with or without religion/faith. I even noticed a possibly unintentional reference at the end of the movie to an earlier metaphor the professor made about 'people wearing blinders'. Ultimately the classroom confrontations don't have Josh trying to outright prove the existence of God; so much as they have him trying to demonstrate how God's existence hasn't been disproved by some of the great minds mentioned. Since people have varying views on this topic, I think the movie asks the viewers to act as the members of Josh's class did; to examine the arguments and make up their own minds, free of outside pressure and bias. Which is a good message, as the how, and why, you want to live your life is important to everyone in the world.",

Not all atheists hate God. In fact, if they hated God they wouldn't be atheists, because in order to hate something you'd need to concede that they did in fact exist. This is a labelling kind of film. It labels Christians into one set, Muslims into another, and Atheists into another. The Muslim part was pretty offensive I guess but in the Middle East Muslims would do far worse. And that's not just stereotyping, it's true. A Christian in countries where Islamic extremist presence is strong has a very low survival rate. But it would be fallacious to label all Muslims in this sense, especially in America.Other notes: You shouldn't vote this film as a bad film simply because you didn't agree from a religious viewpoint. Rate it bad if it is bad. This was not a very good film but neither was it very bad.Verdict: Not a fantastic film by any stretch of the word. Because of it's labelling, it's a one dimensional film.

But not only did this film remove any doubts I may have had as to if it was well executed or not, but it moved and energized me as well.Contrary to what some of the reviews here seem to have said, this film does not portray non-Christians as jerks. Rather, the film shows different kinds of people in different places in their lives with very real struggles. It does not caricature them. Despite how spiteful and hateful the atheist teacher is in the movie, I have actually experienced people like this. The movie doesn't attack these characters, but shows them as human with their own baggage and shows how they, like the rest of us, have a need for God to break through and change their lives. I found the characters to be very realistic and well handled. Also note, that aside of the pastor, none of the other people in the main character's life who call themselves Christians are showing love or support to him, including his own girlfriend.The film so some very intriguing arguments from both the Christian and non-Christian. I can be very analytical and intellectual, so this appealed to me and encouraged me. The movie doesn't just tell you, \"God is real and that's it\" and expect you to just accept it. It makes a solid case for God.And finally, this movie really moved and inspired me. You can't expect every character in this movie is going to experience a life-changing event. That's realistic. Even with a lot of experiences pertaining to God, there are still people who will reject God. But there is a twist late in the movie that was very great.This movie doesn't sugarcoat things but it also doesn't present God without an argument. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a chance.

I particularly found this to be disturbing in the stereotypical way the Muslim family was portrayed. At first I thought this might be where the film was headed when they introduced the Muslim girl. This film needs to be redone with a broader contextual vision to be able to create a more satisfying story line that gets beyond a rather insular portrayal of faith.",

I'm a Christian but often a doubter and this movie is just a little Dogmatic for me. The main character sticks up for himself and his beliefs and that's fine, but all the bad values and actions all the atheist/Muslim characters have is to simple of a personification of those value structures. They are put down as a terrible son in the case of the Business man with a huge Ego/psychopath and a terrible father in the case of the Muslim father who disowns her daughter for being Christian.It over simplifies a really important issue and makes Christianity out to be the only moral correct way.",

I was very disappointed with the film in general. The script was very poorly written, the acting was laughable, and the screenplay was sub-par. The film attempted to maintain multiple story lines but at the same time connect them, providing immense confusion. The film had an almost bipolar feel to it, one minute it was calm the next thing I know this is something out of a Tom Cruise film. Outside of the two lead actors the acting was deplorable. Lines were delivered choppy and without emotion. The last bits of the film are rushed and overwhelming, with too much happening all at once. Overall I give the film a 5/10, the message behind the film was lost in it many mistakes.",

Why all the hate on a movie where a guy realizes he needs Christ, and you say this is not reality; But you look at Alien movies, movies that portrays Christians as psychos, and movies about talking animals but those get high rankings?? This hate is just coming from a place where you need to look inside yourself and realize that you need Jesus too. There is no Hope without Christ. The hope is that you will live forever, without that, what are we here for? It was a good movie to show people other sides. Things like this does exists, and just because there was a lot going, does not mean people aren't like this. Open your eyes, you all get mad because you are like the atheist in this movie.

Half of my family, and all my friends, they're atheists (or God haters), but i wouldn't suggest this film, not even to the believers. I'd easily suggest \"Himalaya - L'enfance d'un chef\", \"Gandhi\" or Lynch's \"Straight Story\", as Christian films (even if they aren't), but this one, no. I guess that Christian films should focus on qualities like sacrifice and forgiveness, and not on an almost complacent \"neo-Christian lifestyle\". And i also guess that the only ones who had a benefit from this film, were the producer(s) and makers (just threw an eye to the \"budget\" and \"gross\" numbers). What i also didn't like,except from the pointless argument between the student and his teacher (belief, is a personal matter, right?) and misinformation (Plato was an atheist. Hm, really?), was the \"muslim\" part of the story. Not that it was a lie in general (it's well known that women in Islam have no rights, and they're just \"pets\" or \"luggage\"), but no real Christian would ever accuse another religion (especially monotheistic), not on a film, neither anywhere else.

            "content": "Praise God he is not dead. My regret is not watching this movie when it first came out. I was curious of the reviews and ratings here on IMDb. It amazed me that this movie really caused people to be offended. The \"Christians\" were offended, atheists were offended. So many people were offended that I knew in my heart this was a must see film. This film spoke the truth, not the truth of those who felt offended, but the truth of the gospel. The father who was a practicing Muslim, saw her daughter listening to a pastor on her Iphone and threw her out. Is that so far fetched that everyone here seemed to claim? No a resounding NO. Muslims and Christianity do not mix. Those offended do you not still have your freedom to choose God Absolutely, your fee will is still in tact. So those \"Christians\" here why so offended? Atheists why do you hate God? There is a reason, but you say no he just doesn't exist. Then why fight against those who believe in God? Why take their right to worship, or want to have Christmas taken from us? Is it so wrong to celebrate our savior's birth? I know why, you've encountered your own pain, your own heartbreak. I know I've been through my own pain, I've questioned God a thousand times over. Remember Christ experienced his own pain, the pain of God the father, forsaking him on the cross. The pain Jesus felt when his disciples/friends turned their backs on him. The pain of the sinners condemned to damnation, the pain of those that were outcasts of society. The physical pain Christ endured on that cross so that we may have salvation. In the movie, it explained that God allows evil to exist because of our own free will. Everyday you have free choice, and true at times evil overpowers us, that we do the regrettable. My moral compass does come from the Bible, because without it everything is permissible. We depend on God every single day, for we can do nothing without God. Do I condemn you? A resounding no, I condemn no one, because I'm a sinner, saved by the blood of Jesus. My salvation doesn't depend on anything I do, no my salvation depends on Christ and him alone. Remember one thing my friends, Romans 8:38-39 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. God loves you with a love that can't be explained, a love that shows grace and mercy, each and every day.My final thoughts on this, Christians never turn sway from the word of God, always stand up for the word. Christ went through so much unthinkable pain for us, When someone says that you offended them because of your faith remember James 1:2. As a Christian if this movie truly offended you, then you must do some soul searching. I don't care if my salvation offends anyone. Yes sometimes when someone spews their hate at me, it hurts, but it is nothing compared to the pain that Christ went through for me. Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes. Now the choice is yours will you accept him or reject him? Yes it's that simple.",

I used the opportunity to share the TRUE Gospel with him.Because the movie did what it was intended to do, I gave it a 7/10.

Why is it that we are the one religion that has complications with practicing what we believe. Why are atheist so angry about Christianity if God does not exist to them. If they don't think he exists then whats the point of caring about the issue at all. When Josh Wheaton says \"How can you be mad at someone that doesn't exist.\" really hit a home run with me. This goes along with so many other issues in our society today. There are people up in arms about people saying that Christians hate gays and so we are persecuted for it. What is the point? As a Christian, we love all people, but we do not have to agree with everything they do. There is nothing wrong with tolerance because it is our opinion and belief. This is not a political issue, but an issue of the heart. If Hooters can legally discriminate not so attractive women from working for them because they do not fit their standards of an attractive waitress, Then why can't a Christian disagree with the agenda of a gay person or an atheist for that matter? You may think this is ridiculous but I consider the issues between gays and Christians linked with something as simple as Hooters being allowed to legally discriminate non attractive women from working at Hooters. This movie depicted a very courageous effort to against what the world and politics wants us to do and that is to basically say that God is dead and that is most certainly is not true. We must stand firm in what we believe and it has inspired me to do just that so this is why I am writing this now. Thank you and enjoy the movie.",

            "content": "I grew up in a Southern Baptist Church, and ended up studying sociology and philosophy in college. And this movie seems to be aimed at people like me. So, here are my thoughts:Christians should be ashamed of this film. Intolerant, hateful, and poorley written, this mess of a movie puts the absolute ignorance of it's creators on display. It follows the story of a Christian college student attending a philosophy class taught by an Atheist professor, who expects his students to embrace Atheism in order to pass his class. The problem is, the writers had no understanding of true philosophy, which not only accepts all beliefs, but welcomes open discussion about morality and theism from all points of view. In fact, it is impossible to discuss or study philosophy without discussing religion and beliefs therein. And they also presumably had never attended a non-Christian university to understand that forcing beliefs upon students as part of a grade would never, ever happen at any certified college. These problems aside, the narrative is full of nonsense filler, unrealistic drama, and bad acting. Misrepresentation of Atheists comes across as hateful propaganda, portraying atheism as evil and inherently lacking in any morals. The movie takes an absolutist stance, and feels more like a propaganda piece created by a cult then a movie made by followers of Jesus Christ. Love, understanding, and acceptance are nowhere to be found here, nor is anything resembling a quality movie. If God wasn't dead before this film released, He surely is now.",

            "content": "Hello, Plot Discussion Main Plot The professor's job as a philosophy instructor would be to use his knowledge to teach certain aspects of the philosophical world. It's not a teacher's job to make the students be expected to believe something that he has not taught, unless the students are expected to enter the class having former knowledge from other classes. It's not the professor's job to force statements of belief from the students. No one is allowed to discriminate a person based on their beliefs. An exception might be with a religious institution, which would be allowed that their employees agree to a set of beliefs. There is a law that states this would be allowed. But the professor is not part of a religious, non-profit institution, so therefore it's against the law for the professor to grade the students based off of personal, religious beliefs. A conflict that would be better is if the professor required an assignment that students write about the topics covered throughout the class. The topic of atheism would be expected to be discussed because it was a primary subject. The class would have to show adequate knowledge of the various beliefs of historical figures claiming atheism. Let's say that Josh fails the paper, so an alternative to make up that grade would be present to the class his antithesis, where the class would have to be convinced of Josh's argument. Subplots Most of the subplots should be cut out, including Amy's, her boyfriend's, the Reverends', and maybe Ayisha but her's could stay as well. If a subplot connects to the life of the main character's then it should be included. If God's Not Dead is compared to The Lord of the Rings, we see that all of the sub plots in The Lord of the Rings can be connected to the journey of destroying the ring. As each sub plot develops, there are miniature goals that are created, but even so, the audience can connect these goals to the primary one: destroy the ring. In God's Not Dead, it seems that these sub plots are just to tell a story, therefore they have no real purpose to the main story. The sub plots seem like good ideas from the writers that don't exactly fit together. They're separate stories that shouldn't necessarily be meshed together. The Two Sides I feel a very important issue with this story is how they portray their two sides: the Christians and the Atheists. I don't think they portray the atheists very well at all. I think that most atheists come to terms with their sense of faith through their own thought. They've studied and thought and have looked at the different pieces of evidence around them that allows them to form their own beliefs. The professor in this movie becomes an atheist because his mother died when he was 12 and he started to hate God. I think it's clever for the writers to have the turning point in the movie, a shift from disbelief to actual hatred. On the other hand, I think it's weak because it portrays the opposing side as a weaker argument. In contrast, the writer's should have developed the opposing side as true believers.The supporting characters of the opposing side were weak as well. That dinner party would not have been enjoyable. I guarantee that most atheists do not get together, drink crappy wine, and talk about how ridiculous the Christians are. Instead, they would laugh, enjoy life, connect to each other in deep ways, and enjoy the evening just like other people. The supporting characters should have been developed more so that they portray accurate human traits.Character Development Because there are so many sub plots, this takes away from the characterization of each person. Yes, you can have the argument that when a character accepts Jesus into his/her heart, that character is developing. On the other hand, I feel that is only development if the audience member is Christian. So while the character may be changing spiritually, I don't see that the character develops in any other way. If we look at the movie Everything Is Illuminated, the audience feels that they've just had an adventure with each character. Arguably, the least developed character is Jonathan, however there is still development because he allows himself to stretch his discomforts, like with Sammy Davis Jr. Even though his major belief systems have not changed, like they have with Alex's family (at first hating Jews, then realizing the Grandfather came from a Jewish town), Jonathan still stretches himself. In God's Not Dead, I don't necessarily get this feeling that I've just had an adventure with the characters. The main character, Josh, doesn't significantly change; I still feel he's the same person at the beginning and at the end. He's had to strengthen himself with his discussion of atheism versus creationism, but I don't see how he changes in other ways. The professor does change, however in a very cheesy manner. He does accept Christ into his heart, but only because he's dying. His development stops at that point. Prior to dying, the professor was searching for his former girlfriend, Mina. I think it would have been even more interesting to see the discussion formed when he found her, it would have shown his development. Amy Ryan develops as a character, but she's hardly connected to any of the main characters. Who is she? Oh ya, she's the blogger... who doesn't interact with the main plot. Other than a few minor cases of development, most of the characters stay mostly the same. There is no true changes in their identity, how they change their lives to conform their new beliefs, and how their behavior changes from that point forward.",

The protagonist used apologetics to defend Christianity and I can almost assure that the people whom were offended by this film, are most likely triggered because of some underlying truth they are suppressing. In the film, the atheist professor was previously a Christian, and due to life circumstances he turned away and decided \"there is no God\".This movie made me cry, it is so powerful down to the ending. I watched it twice, and will probably watch it a few more times to learn how to better defend my faith when questioned.",

None of us are worthy of heaven on our own. Without God's word, there is no morality, other than what man decides for himself in the moment. This is why so many reject God's word, and live such perverse and immoral lives. This many not be a perfect movie, but then again none of us are perfect.

She was into the movie, also. Lots of sub-plots, and tension throughout the movie between various people, including the atheist college professor (Kevin Sorbo) and the student (Shane Harper), who was singled out and ostracized by the professor. Kevin Sorbo was so convincing, and he behaved just like the atheists I've come across on the internet (i.e. YouTube, etc.). Sorbo and Dean Cain's attitudes were convincingly arrogant, obnoxious, and atheistic. Any Christian would be encouraged by the message in this movie. It falls a bit short on the available arguments against atheism and evolutionism, but the arguments that were given were good.The previous comment, where the person said, he was a Christian pastor... I don't believe what he said... about himself, or what he said about the movie. He seemed like an atheist with an ax to grind. The Narnia story may have been written by a Christian, but it wasn't a Christian movie, nor did it teach anything about Christianity.I've also read many of the reviews from obvious atheists, and I doubt that 99% of them even watched the movie. They just don't like the movie's title, or that there should be a movie produced that would ever make Christians feel good about their faith. I don't have enough faith to be an atheist, so I\"ll stand by my Christian faith and what God revealed to us in the Holy Bible.",

            "review_title": "Good movie but...",
            "content": "This is a good movie but it could have been better. If the point of this movie was to reach and change the heart of non-Christians then the director should have also included characters that portrayed good people who are not saved, and the debate between the two sides. It seemed like it was geared toward Christians who already have a relationship with God and the struggles that \"some of them\" deal with. I do agree that the director made it seem like anyone who wasn't Christian was angry. However, to his point there are a number of people in this world who don't know how to deal with death and blame God or are struck with an illness and become angry at the world. This is not far-fetched. To make this film reach the target audience they should have accounted for people who can better relate to the story. There were a lot of Non-Christian who watched this film based on the title alone. This was an opportunity to plant a seed. We know that not everyone is angry about God's existence, sometimes they don't know, don't understand or have their own personal reasons to believe what they do. What is far-fetched is that a professor would ask such a thing from his/her students. That was not very believable. I get that the writer needed a premise for the movie, but this needed to be thought out a little more. However, I do like that this turned in to a movie that would include debating. I would have liked them to delve into that more. That being said, this movie did hit some points that are still very important to remember. You are to stand boldly against the adversary. When faced with a difficult decision, this young man took up his cross and faced rejection from friends, family and those around him to defend his belief in God. SIDE NOTE: No one should be forced to give up their beliefs. Understand, there are so many people missing out on a relationship with God because of what they see in the day to day lives of Christians. If, we treat others as if they are dammed to hell, how do we expect them to open their hearts to the love that Jesus has for us? We are to treat others with love, kindness and forgiveness. We are to pick up our own cross and follow in His footsteps not our own. After all, what man really has the right to judge? I will admit some Christians come off very strong and forceful. We must remember that we can only plant the seed in the heart of man, only God can change the heart of man. When someone tries to force you to change most likely you won't. God never forces himself on you, He doesn't have to. He wants you to open your hearts to him willing. He has blessed you with free will. Imagine there is a door to your heart and you have the lock, key and door knob on the inside, on the outside of the door there is no way in. That is where Jesus is standing and waiting. Just like falling in love with a man or a women, you have to open that door to let them in. They can't force you to love them. That's the same for Jesus. He is standing at the door to your heart and it's your choice to let him in. This film could have also touched more on how people in this world still don't know Jesus Christ as their savior. How it takes more than doing good works and living day to get them into heaven. There are so many lost people in this world. As Christian's, we believe that good works alone will not open the gates of heaven. Only confessing with your mouth and believing in your heart that Jesus sacrificed himself for you is the only way into heaven. Many people have a problem with that statement, and that is their decision. Not everyone will agree with that statement. That verse in the bible was not put there as a means for debate or discussion, although it usually becomes one. It was put there as a way to the truth and the light. It is your choice to believe in it or not. The debate scenes were good, but only proved that he was not a true atheist. At some point in his youth he was taught about God by his mother. He was angry at God for his mother's death. So how do you really prove that God is not dead? The truth is by faith. And what is faith? Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of the unseen. Your faith is the proof. For some that is not a good enough answer. And for those people I say, taste and see. Open your heart to the love of God. Pray daily in a quiet place. Then pick you a bible and let him reveal himself to you. Only then will you know in your heart that God is not dead. I know many of you including myself had your own ideas of what this film was going to be and even what it could have been. I do not agree that it was as horrible as people are making it out to be. We all have our opinions and for me I enjoyed most of the movie because it was heart felt. All the director wanted you to do was believe in something much greater then yourself. God has something greater than our existence on earth. This movie may have its faults, but overall I pray that it planted a seed in someone's heart to be saved. \uf04a",

            "content": "My thoughts come from the perspective of a Unitarian Panentheist... I lean towards a lot of Christian beliefs, but remain agnostic/unsure on the parts of the doctrine surrounding Jesus and the crucifixion. But I do absolutely believe in God, and am down for a movie that \"sticks it to the atheists\" any day. :) And I did feel that the debates were pretty well-done! Good points were brought up on both sides, and honestly I would have been able to give it an extra 1-2 stars if more screen time had been given to the debate rather than going off into all these subplots with absolutely cringey, unrealistic scenarios. Oh my god the melodrama in this movie is TERRIBLE, lol... the way that Leftist Girl with Cancer's materialistic boyfriend reacted when she told him she had cancer... I literally shouted \"LMAO WHAT THE HECK?!\" at the screen. I mean, I've met some real crappy people in my life, but some of these characters feel like memes with how unrealistic they are. The Muslim father's reaction was pretty cringe, too, and disrespectful/intolerant to Muslims. The main character's girlfriend was also particularly cringe-worthy with trash-tier writing to explain why she was upset and wanted to break up with him.But what got me the most was the ending. I mean... what the actual hell? Like, if you want to go that route with the atheist dying, then okay... that CAN be done well and there IS a good message that can be had with that! It would be far more impactful if he stayed alive and redeemed himself, but if you absolutely have to have him die to prove your point, fine, it isn't automatically garbage. HOWEVER. WHY THE ACTUAL HECK WOULD YOU INTERTWINE A HAPPY CONCERT SCENE IN THE MIDST OF THE ATHEIST GUY DYING!?!?!?!? WHAT?!?!? Holy CHRIST that was an absolute TRASH move and had me literally burying my head in my hands. That whole scene just came off as really off-putting, and I frankly wouldn't blame actual atheists for being pushed even further away from Christianity after watching something like that. It's a real shame, too, because this movie, even despite its unrealistic premise and trash subplots, STILL had the potential to turn itself around at the end and have a genuinely good message.How?Either:\nA) Atheist guy makes it to the concert alive, makes amends with his ex-girlfriend, and gradually begins to renew his belief in God. Main character pretty much destroyed him in the debate and he seemed like he was finally coming to understand that he DOES believe in God, but hates Him for allowing pain and suffering. \"How can you hate some(thing) that doesn't exist?\" was pretty 10/10 tbh, and was the perfect set-up for a redemption arc.Actually SHOWING an atheist being confronted with the fact that his unbelief is rooted in fear and hatred of pain/suffering, and then showing him changing his mind from there, coming to a sense of peace that humanity has free will and we do these bad things to ourselves, but that God is beyond good and evil and all-present even amongst our free will and suffering... heck, that would have been amazing, and likely would have had the potential to ACTUALLY change people's minds who watched the movie.Or, if you absolutely have to take the easy way out and make him die...\nB) Show his spirit leaving his body and meeting God. This easily has the potential to be an incredible, mind-changing scene! Go full \"Job\" on the audience and show God as this infinitely incomprehensible but endlessly brilliant presence that extends beyond time and space, beyond good and evil. I cannot personally answer whether all our suffering truly has a purpose in \"God's Plan\" or whether we simply bring it on ourselves through our spiritual sickness and free will... however, either way, isn't the message at the heart of Christianity that God's love is infinite even when we are struggling in our spiritual sickness (sin)? That as long as we open our heart to the divine, we will be embraced? So SHOW that! Not just some half-assed \"ok, I believe in Jesus now, guess I'll die\" crap, what the hell?! AT LEAST SHOW HIM MEETING JESUS?!? Heck, this sort of scene could have been so beautiful and literally moved the hearts of the audience!! If you truly have faith and believe in God, it isn't hard to come up with such a scene, especially if you portray God as Jesus!The fact that they just showed this poor atheist guy who had FINALLY begun to question his beliefs... just freaking DYING out of nowhere at the end and being like \"ok I accept Jesus lol\" and then a happy concert scene and nothing else happens... was just... WHY?! Honestly, it made me question the faith of the people who made the movie! How could they not come up with something more than that?! At least have him meet Jesus on the way to Heaven and take his hand or something, jeeze! That'd be the BARE MINIMUM EFFORT!! But they didn't even have the faith to depict that! Yikes.It's such a shame... the debate was solid enough that, if they focused more on it and had an actual ending SHOWING the audience what God is like after the atheist dies (or just shows the atheist changing his mind and redeeming his faith) it could easily have been a 8-star movie and changed people's minds. I wish Christian movies could be written by people who are even halfway competent and have enough faith to actually show God's love in a movie.",

Watch it for yourself.. there is a reason they fear it so much they had to come here and try to rate it down.

First, let me say that much of this movie is exaggerated. Given that, I will also say that I have known/still know several atheists. Now, I will also say that this movie wasn't made to attack those people. Think of it this way... If you KNEW you would die tomorrow, would you rethink your decision of being an atheist? Would you second guess what happens when you die? As a Christian myself, I choose to follow God. I also recognize that others choose not to. While I respect them as human beings, I would still hope that if they happened to see this movie, that they would second guess themselves. If nothing else, let this movie challenge you. Although it may be biased, it is with good reason. I wouldn't call it propaganda, I would call it an effort to bring as many people as possible to Christ. I remember sitting in my chair watching it thinking \"if I died today, what would happen to me and where would I go?\" not \"God's not Dead.\" I know he isn't dead, but that isn't the purpose of the film.

It's free of cursing, extramarital sex, scantily dressed women, and other questionable activity. It's a great conversation starter and a way to encourage people to share their faith. I just watched it and was really pleased with how the story line showed that just one young man willing to protect and explain his faith changed the lives of so many people. We don't know sometimes how to witness to others, so we don't do anything at all. By defending his choice not to say \"God is Dead\" Josh made a choice that would influence those in his direct contact, some for a lifetime, and others at a critical place in their lives. My heart rejoiced at the end of the movie when the consequences of his decision caused the reaction it did.Non-believers may have negative things to say about this movie; in fact, I'm sure many of them will. However, in this time of movies full of people trashing Christian morals and integrity, it was really refreshing to watch a movie I could easily view with my grandchildren and not worry about foul language or anything else I wouldn't want them to see. I pray that more movies like this are made, and publicized, and I plan on following the company that made it so I can keep up on any new movies I can see that have such a positive message and Christian viewpoint.Keep up the good work!!!",

            "content": "At first I wasn't too keen on watching a religious movie then having to do a review on it. However after watching this movie I can say I am not disappointed, in fact it was heaps better than expected. I laughed, I cried, it was just a fantastic movie overall. After going online to see what other people think after watching this movie, I was absolutely shocked. Majority if not all of the reviews were negative, most of which said this movie was \"offensive\", \"unbelievably simplistic\", \"bad\", \"insulting\", \"disgusting\", \"pedantic Christian propaganda garbage\". To say this was surprising none the less but what I thought of this movie was completely the polar opposite. I thought it was really inspiring for me as a fellow Christian to see this freshman in university standing up for his faith to a university professor. As a freshman in high school it is already hard enough for me to admit my faith to my friends none the less stand up to a professor. So I find that point really appalling and brave for Josh to do so. Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie was how many different perspectives I got to see Christianity play out into different people's lives. It was amazing and really interesting to see how different cultures and people with different backgrounds see Christianity and how it took out to be a part of their lives. As for people saying it to be a offensive movie, I do so where they are coming from. The movie does contain certain stereotypes which may not appeal to everyone. However I feel like that is just reality, a massive chunk of the stereotypes in fact does play out in our society. It might not be majority but there is definitely and always will be a minority that does deliver out to that stereotype. And I'm sorry the movie is brutally honest by pointing out those facts but it definitely plays a part in our society and is happening and definitely is true. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because I think it is inspiring to see what a huge difference having a religion could shape out your life to be. It was fascinating to see how people acted within the group script of standing up to their beliefs and the pressure of having a religion on your shoulders with how you are supposed to act and all. All in all I thought this was a great movie which deserves a lot more praise than what it is getting. There certainly are things that could be improved on but overall is a fantastic movie which was easy to relate to and step in the shoes of the characters. I also really enjoyed the end part where they had snippets of the Newsboys concert. It was great to incorporate the musical ending and getting the special appearances of Newsboys, Willie and Korie Robertson. Would highly recommend this movie to anyone next year our just as a easy laid back movie to watch.",

My top ten being Ridley Scott's Blade Runner , to Coppola's Apocylapse Now to Speilbergh's countless masterpieces or more obsecure directors like Lynch, Cronenbergh etc. This is a really good movie! Maybe not a great one , but it's close to being that. A lot of reviewers who want to hate the movie claim it is a simplistic film, but that is kind of point. The movie is really a shout out to the world that as much as Richard Dawkin's or Hitchen's wait to convince you faith is just hooey , that is God is not dead. I really look at what people have said and they are not really attacking the movie they are more attacking faith itself. I find it so ironic this attack on faith, as now that those who wish to see it done away with, haven't really created a better world. In fact the loss of faith has helped to pave way to the world we have today. Rampant school shootings, more division, less understanding and compassion and outright witch hunts on those who are not politically correct. When you see all the negative reviews posted just remember they are posted by humanist's who as much as they hate God , really can and have not proved in any way to have any better answers.",

If you don't believe that, look at all of the different \"real world\" cases that are listed at the end of the movie. The reality is that we live in a world that now has largely turned it's back on God. Even some of those who profess to be Christians, would rather have a God who is distant, is not involved in their daily lives, and would not dare to say that we have such a problem as sin and that we are all sinners and that God is a Just God who demands payment for our sins. In the end, we want to do what we want to do and we don't like to feel guilty about it. This movie hits to that core. God is indeed not Dead, he is still in charge, and not matter what we try to come up with our human minds, we can't explain him away. Any Christian movie eluding to this truth no matter how well made will receive low marks. I dare you to find one that doesn't. It tells you that state of our society where there isn't much room for the God of the Bible. There is only room for false gods that we make up for ourselves that suit our own needs. If your not afraid of watching this movie and then reading and researching for yourself to discover what is true and what isn't, then I highly recommend you watch it! :)",

If any of my professors had acted like the one portrayed in this movie, they would be reported and suspended. The character was obviously a simplistic stereotype of someone who hates God, but in real life, philosophy professors, having gone through the discipline of philosophy, tend to have a more open mind than this fellow. It did not remind me of my college career at all.Secondly, this film nauseously panders to a very clich\u00e9 version of pop-Christianity, bypassing everything that would make a good movie... engaging characters, and a good story, for example.

            "content": "It is odd to me that people who have seen this movie complains that individuals from different backgrounds and beliefs are portrayed inaccurately. Literally every single secular movie I've ever seen (except Here comes the boom perhaps) portrays Christians as unsure, weak willed, pale faced nerds who ultimately end up at some party and start drinking. Not a single Christian who I know fits this description. I think it's important to note that this movie is not based on a true story either, nor intend to suggest that this is the norm world wide regarding different beliefs. Having said that, in many cases the portrayals in this movie is not that far off, but I've definitely met many great non believing people in my life...As a devout child of God I enjoyed the movie. I think the cases and arguments from a Christian point of view range from fairly average to good, but from a life time of experience I've learnt that no amount of factual evidence or testimonies would ever convert a non believer who does not want to believe ANYway - who has already made up his/her mind. Just like I would be hard pressed to understand how the \"scientific\" method of the Evolution theory could be based on an initial event that cannot be explained (How was the universe compressed? Where did this force come from that allowed this dense area to start spinning? Where did the energy come from for for it to explode?), and based on Macro evolution that has never been observed in the history of mankind. Explainable, testable proofs are, after all, the basis of something being scientific.I think God's not dead was a good movie. It's definitely not for everyone, perhaps aimed more at people who are already believers in God. I just wished these Christian movies would be less overwhelmingly dramatic at its core, because personally, my walk with God is much more joyous and much less dramatic :)",

For that matter, doesn't every movie and opinion about world views contain a bias?For those who have commented that the professor is \"over the top\", I have witnessed in the news, on the web via videos the type of behavior from professors that you are saying occurs in this film. Lawrence M Krauss at Arizona State University comes to mind. He regularly accuses Christians of child abuse for teaching from the Bible. I would consider that an \"over the top\", mean-spirited and demonstrably false idea.While it may be true that the film portrays Christians and non-Christians in a particular light. The philosophy of each world view (there are really only two world views) lends itself to be extrapolated to a particular end. By the many reviews I read, that extrapolation occurred in this film.Final statement: It would seem that the ultimate goal of the film is to foster discussion and convict those who do not believe that God exists. Both goals would appear to be achieved indicated by the apparent anger from unbelievers and confessing Christians alike. To my \"Christian\" Brothers and Sisters, attacking other Christians in a mean-spirit is tantamount to murder according to Jeshua/Jesus. You will know them by their love for one another.",

It's a rather small production, with a more or less mediocre acting even though it gains some points because of some of its ideas and/or points of view. But (and there is a big BUT) the movie centers its whole significance in saying that if you're not a Christian, you're wrong, or by saying that no matter what else you are, you must accept Jesus in your heart and only then you will be rewarded. Aaaaammeeen!*They're not a lot of spoilers ahead, but i need to give some examples of the history to base my point*It gives some harsh stereotype regarding Muslims (it portraits a father who beats up her daughter just because she was hearing the bible, now, I'm not saying it couldn't happen but it's just a proof that this movie shows off the negative part of non-Christians, repeating a modern society's wrong misconception instead of promoting the idea of God whatever its origin or kind). And, by the way, every non-Christian character in this movie converts itself to Christianity. And in the end, after all the debate about whether there is a God or not, you just discover yourself looking at an intense fight between atheists and Christians. Rather than approach the question philosophically by gathering as much different beliefs, it just puts a sordid music (with is quite catchy though) to make every single one in the family (even old grandma there) dance and forget all of their inner doubts and fears. (mind, that I am no atheist)But, truly speaking, I'm literally OK with that. The only and major problem is, do they have the divine right to raise their belief above every other one and proclaim once and for all, I am convict that only MY god is not dead, that only MY faith is correct, that only MY god is not dead, he is surely alive... ladies and gentlemen:Christian god is not dead (2014).",

Immediately I knew it would be a good treatment/rehab movie. So in that sense it did not disappoint me really, and I listened to the story, and enjoyed the actors and production peoples attempts to tackle very profound topics with an interesting story line. There is only so much you can do with so much time and money and resources. I think the combined efforts of these people produced what they intended successfully, without misrepresenting the intent of the movie. Even though there were obvious corners cut and undeveloped plots or whatever - it was sweet and thought provoking and I don't think was meant to be anything else, and delivered the story that kept me watching. Ya know, God Bless em....

Please don't take this bad review as an indication of my faith in God.This movie wants to be the \"Magnolia\" of Christian Films. It offers up not one! not two! but three - count 'em- three! antagonists in the form of an atheist professor (big bad liberal university), a cancer stricken journalist who is out to \"get\" Christian celebrities w/ her ambush journalism (liberal media), and a greedy corporate executive (big soulless corporations). It doesn't just want you to realize God's not Dead, but it's going to use a hammer to get the point across.Kevin Sorbo and some of the older actors do a good job in their roles (except Dean Cain, does he ever seem like he's NOT overacting in any of his roles?) In fact, because of the fine job of the KS as the professor, and the actors who played the pastor and missionary, it shines a light all the more brighter on the bad acting job of the younger actors.The story seems forced and contrived at times. I was actually winching in my seat at some of the improbable scenes and inconsistencies. For example, in one scene, the professor is on the 2nd floor of the college building. Young college student comes in to the building and presses the button for the elevator. Professor gets in the elevator, goes down on it so he is in the elevator when the college student gets in, and then rides back UP to the 2nd floor w/ the student, all the while standing behind him and making snide remarks about how the student is going to fail his class. Did the professor get in the elevator just to bait the student? Has he not heard about harassment laws? Evil Atheist Professor! Wham! The end felt contrived also. Why was the professor running to get to the concert after reading a letter from his dead mother? It made no sense. Was he hoping to somehow find her in the crown of 10,000 people? And the cancer journalist chick (Evil Media! Whack!), pouring her heart out to the Newsboys. So now the Newsboys are grief counselors in their spare time? Do they hang out at the concerts all by themselves just waiting for people to burst in and cry to them? Too many characters w/ too many problems and too many stereotypes make the real message get muddled in all the chaos.

Feel free to read or ignore whichever you wish...The real story here was not about a man who was an Atheist trying to abuse a kid who was a Christian, but how does God expect us to act in the presence of those who would have us renounce our faith. If you listen at the beginning when Josh is speaking to the Reverend, Josh is pointed to Matthew Chapter 10 verses 32-33: So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, 33 but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven. Also, although they did not mention it in the movie but it's clear from the events that unfolded, that Matthew 10 verses 37-39 is portrayed: 37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 38 And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Seems very straightforward here... If someone asks you to deny your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and it may very well happen, or that Jesus existed at all, and if you deny God exists then you deny Jesus exists as well because Jesus is not only the Son Of God, but He is God... Phil 2:5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, Phil 2:6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped. Then you are not behaving as a Christian is expected to behave in the eyes of God. These are not my words, but they are from the Bible. You can feel free to gripe against me all you want, but there it is in black and white. As so many reviewers have said...There is NO gray area and with God they are right. There is NO gray area. I'm sorry that the truth can be harsh sometimes, but that doesn't make it any less truthful. In that respect and the way the movie is portrayed as a Christian who is standing his ground against all odds, this movie is excellent. As Christian's we are expected to stand our ground against those who want us to compromise our faith. I'm sorry to those who do not understand this is what the Bible commands us to do. If you don't believe me then that's your choice...I suggest you read in the Bible, the Book of Job and also the works by the Apostle Paul to see 2 fine examples of people who continued to have faith and profess God, and in Paul's case Jesus Christ, even in the most adverse conditions if you want God's thoughts on it.* End of Movie Review *",

Nope: the Apostle Paul said in Romans 3:11 (is it?) that ALL HUMANS have natural laws written on their hearts, so even the staunchest atheist has a basis for morality and possess a conscience, per Paul.IMDb shows the film cost the production company some $2 mil to make (and it shows), yet the film has netted $60 MIL (as of 6/14).A 30X ROI so far?

The premise of the movie is that students enter a philosophy class, and their first assignment is to write on a piece of paper \"God is Dead\", then sign their name to it. It is down to one student, that refuses to write and sign the paper. The professor ostracizes the student, but gives him a chance, via 3 lectures to prove God exists. The movie could have been over in 60 seconds, by the reasoning, If you want me to write God is Dead, then you would have to assume He has to be alive at one time or another, for Him to be dead. If he was alive, then He exists. I blame this flaw on, the Christians that wrote the movie, probably never consulted an atheist, or studied their point of view. As a Christian, I applaud any movies that show God, or Christianity in a positive light. But in the same sense, if you are not going to be objective, and view all non Christians, as stereotypical characters, that are always attacking Christianity, then I think you will drive more away from your beliefs, than you attract.

The movie did a great job in portraying what the real message of Christianity is, but didn't do so well in other aspects. Obviously this film wasn't going to be Oscar worthy, but still, the acting was mediocre and extremely cheesy at times. Some parts of the movie were very realistic, for example, Josh is a Christian college kid surrounded by people not of his faith. Very often, the religious person is always the one left out and has their faith tested. Especially in his case, it was difficult and courageous for him to stand up to Prof. Radisson. However, it would be ridiculous for a teacher to be this hostile toward a student and his beliefs. Since it was a philosophy course, I get how God would get in the way of some topics, but removing God from the entire equation like Prof. Radisson did was a little over-the-top. Something I strongly disliked was the fact that Ayisha was portrayed as a Muslim girl with an overbearing father. I felt that it just added to the stereotype that many Americans have against Muslims and that they definitely could have portrayed her in a different but still positive light. What bugged me the most was how quickly Proffesor Radisson came to Christ. Now yes, some people do indeed become believers overnight, but his death scene was just unrealistic. I would love to believe that that could have possibly happened, but it's just not realistic. Overall, God's Not Dead had good intentions and many positive messages about the Christian faith, but failed to show the realistic side of it all.",

            "content": "The movie God's Not Dead (2014), directed by Harold Cronk, is a drama following the experience of freshman college student Josh Wheaton played by Shane Harper and his philosophy professor, Professor Radisson played by Kevin Sorbo. On the first day of Philosophy class, Professor Radisson, an opinionated anti-theist instructs his students to write, \"God is dead\" on a piece of paper. Josh, who is a strong believer of the Christian faith, refuses to write the statement, even after Professor Radisson threatens to fail him and jeopardize his future in law. As a compromise, Josh must spend the semester researching and finding proof that God is not dead; the class will determine whether Josh or Professor Radisson is right. Other characters are interwoven in the plot, including an arrogant businessman, Marc, who leaves his journalist girlfriend, Amy, after she is diagnosed with cancer, Ayisha who must hide her Christian faith from her conservative Muslim father, Reverend Dave and Jude learn more about faith, and Mina must take care of her mother.Religion, faith, and determination are central ideas in this movie. While his parents and girlfriend discourage him in fear that he will fail the class, Josh's strong spirituality, unwavering faith, and determination to fight for what he believes in gives him courage to defend God and risk failing Professor Radisson's philosophy class. Another theme may be the fact that when situations occur, it becomes clear who truly cares for you. One example of this is when Amy is diagnosed with cancer, her boyfriend Marc obviously does not care about her and leaves her. Overall, this was not the best movie I have seen but it was very entertaining. I think that the movie was well done and the actor's performance was great. One of my critiques is that Josh managed to convince everyone in the Philosophy class of God's existence, which was slightly predictable. Also, in a real life situation, not everyone would have the same views, and everyone seemed to change their minds quite quickly. Despite the fact that this movie was slightly cheesy and over dramatic at times, the messages presented were strong and significant.",

            "content": "I think that God's Not Dead was a decent movie, but what I liked was that it made me think. After Prof. Radisson tells Josh to sign the statement saying God is Dead and he refuses to, I got very interested in what would happen next. When Radisson told Josh to prove so, his life changed. He broke up with his girlfriend simply for insisting so much that God is not dead. His first two arguments were completely shut down by Radisson. I personally feel the climax, when Radisson was defeated was very bad. After the Professor says that he hates God because of his mother's death even after praying so much, Martin stands up and says God is not dead, and everyone agrees, causing Radisson to lose the argument. I think this part was silly because in the end, neither of them by actually convincing the other, which was what I was expecting or hoping for the whole time. That was very disappointing. But a thing I liked was the way the movie made me think. I'm not a religious person; I would call myself a deist. It made me think what it would actually feel like to think that there was someone up there looking out for you? I have never felt that way and never will. What is it about that person, whom you don't even know exists, that would make you do anything; to the extent of sacrificing a person you love (Josh's girlfriend) for that person? It really did make me think about that a lot. Sometimes I want to have that belief in a deity or person up there, but I just can't. Overall, the storyline was sub-par, but the movie made me think a lot about spirituality and religion.",

If any of my brothers in service had questioned God, never been baptized, and sought only to help others then they would be damned until they acted in a way similar to the professor in the movie. However, the professor was given a chance. To my brother's who died instantaneously in the blast of an IED, this movie has told me you are damned. You are damned, but the man who belittled generations of students, verbally abused his wife, and consistently abused his power for gain is saved in the eyes of God. What God, I ask, bases his judgement on the words of \"I accept you\" instead of \"I accept the way you lived your life\". The men I served with were honorable, empathetic, and data-driven. No movie the condemns them bases upon their agnosticism is a true movie of God or \"free will\" that is implied with this movie's theme. This, which was supposed to tie together the theme of movie failed. In doing so, the rest of the trials and tribulations and over exaggerated \"evil\" of the lawyer and other atheistic believers were less impactful because that man can simply ask for forgiveness but if someone inherently good doesn't they are damned.Also, invading the privacy of a man having just died to show a God is Not Dead text is pointless and insincere. Especially from two \"men of God\" such as themselves.",

Though this movie isn't to the extent as some other movies about God are, this movie does portray well the struggle between Atheists and Christian's. You see, many Atheists will deny that they don't hate Christian's and that they don't hate God but, if you go to any public forum, Facebook or any other place where both groups might be, you'll find that the hatred is clear. One example of that is a Facebook page called Atheism 411. Anyway, back to the movie. I think that the movie brings about many questions concerning God and I think that the professor is a clear representation of how Atheists abuse their power. True that if this were to happen in real colleges, this would be something that would cause an uproar. The movie its-self isn't really based on all reality but, it's fair enough to say that it's a good movie when talking about someone making a good argument and standing up for what he believes in. I believe that the movie made a lot of sense as far as, the movie showed a great deal of authentic feelings from both sides. After watching the entire movie, I felt moved by both sides and I felt sad during certain parts of the movie. The ending of the movie was happy and sad at the same time. I'm disappointed in how the movie ended though, they could have taken it further than they did. I hope there will be a part 2.",

Christians believe that God is unique entity that is available to anyone and not just Christians. You really can't review something you don't believe in. Every answer from every non-christian is always going to feel like they are getting attacked. Christians all believe we are all sinners in the eyes of God and nobody is safe from death. Anyone can pray to God. This movie shows that we are all immoral but by the grace of God we can be saved by him, not ourselves. To think this movie is an attempt to make secular people look bad is still something from a sinner as it is the people who made this and all media and other things are sinners.

You can judge this movie's plot, its overall message, the acting, the picture, the music, or whatever else movies are rated on. Let me tell you the grand reason why I gave it it 10. I gave it a 10 because I'm a Christian, and because I LIKED the movie...as simple as that. And by the way, as bad as the acting might have been at some points, or as \"offensive\" as the message might have been at some points...the truth of the matter is that none of those things will change the 10/10 that's plastered in here! Sure, I'm being a bit obnoxious (believe me, I'm trying), but this seems to be what the American way is all about now days anyway...lets voice our opinion -in spite of how silly or illogical our opinion might be- knowing that if someone is offended about it we can just call them intolerant. Well, my friends...I was encouraged, and pushed to be more of a witness for Christ by this movie. I love Jesus, I think He is the only way to heaven, I believe the Bible is the reliable and inerrant Word of God, and if you are offended by this...well then...you are just intolerant.

The characters were cardboard, and the situations unlikely. It was more like a Christian's dream of a good day rather than their (or I should say our) real experience. Miracles do happen, but when you put them in a film, they need to carry some conviction.My own experience of evangelism is that nothing goes that smoothly. But the film might annoy a few people.

And it happens several times.And the professor was horrible, but I don't think it's legally possible in the US that a professor can be so condescending to his whole class without being sued for at least a couple of millions.And the worst part was, when the Chinese student phoned his dad, the Chinese student spoke in Cantonese, and the father is replying in Mandarin!!!!!!! So they're essentially speaking in 2 different languages. This is horrible. Very, very horrible. If the director doesn't speak Chinese he should at least check someone who understands.All in all, pretty good easy movie.",

            "content": "Well, first off, I don't think there's a whole lot to be said on 'spoiling' this movie, not any more than it already has been in other reviews, or hey, the trailer itself. We all know, going into it, what the premise of this movie is. And many, based on that, are refuting its artistic value. But know this, as with everything, what some may decline to be 'artistic' others will lovingly embrace and find the very value intended. This isn't a matter of close-mindedness. I wasn't, be family technicality, 'born' a Christian. And not only do I not reject the idea of 'alternatives', I continue to examine them. I've been expressly agnostic in the past, and I've struggled to find my place in Christianity. So, having said that, I see this movie as having an excellent place, even if it doesn't 'single-handedly' 'undo all of atheism and agnosticism' and convert us into some 'one world Christianity' it would seem some are so deeply concerned would occur if...:gasp: EVERYONE SUDDENLY BECAME a Jesus FOLLOWING Christian. (\"Oh my!\"- commence exaggerated facial expressions) But what this movie MAY just do, where it may fall in...just as those 'simple' verses given to Josh proved to do, is be a seed of deeper faith and a reminder of the very passion and truth of Our Blessed Creator. I agree, the roles appeared...almost heavily exaggerated, though let me remind you, it also didn't paint but a few very faithful Christians in a very positive light either. I went into this movie having originally read the reviews that attempt to tear down any premise of value in this movie, so going in, I was even hesitant to click and watch it when I finally did. So let me tell you what this movie DID do for me, in all of its 'simplistic' mindset. It didn't give me 'new ammo' in terms of 'new logical reasons' fighting the case for God, no, what this movie did, was remind me on a faith deep level of what it means to call myself a Christian. Plain and simple. And born from that, maybe, we can find the strength of faith within us to get that much more in touch with all that that entails. A movie, in and of itself, is just that. A movie, a condensed story line, and it requires and relies on idioms and tropes and all of that sort to communicate deep messages. No, this may not have been the next Inception in terms of 'art', but maybe...just maybe...not everything needs to be...to still carry something very truly and deeply valuable to those the message needs to find. It's not groundbreaking, it's not earth shattering, and it's not revolutionary and exquisite...but I'll tell you what it IS...it's valuable...in this case...maybe explicitly because it doesn't make you go so deep that you lose the point behind the movie...but instead...just enough to fit where there's room, and go wherever you'll allow it. So, yea, anyone who doesn't go into this knowing that they have plenty of room to be filled by faith...probably won't get a whole lot out of a movie they walked in explicitly entering to block and reject. It will reach whoever it shall, exactly...as it should. Nothing more, nothing less. Nothing fancy necessary. After all, the truth doesn't really ever need much...just room.",

            "content": "\"God's Not Dead\" is a movie made with good intentions but from a bad angle. It had a good message, meant to support the Christian belief and show the power of faith, but it wasn't done in the best way. It's biggest problem is its stereotyping, which got so extreme at times that it could be offending. For example, all the atheists were portrayed as cruel, self-centered people. Martin, a Chinese foreign-exchange student, was shown with a father who only cared about pleasing teachers and getting good grades. Ayisha and her father, the only Muslim family show in the film, is portrayed as old-fashioned and extremely intolerant of other beliefs. Understandably, these stereotypes could be insulting to some people (which is probably why the Rotten Tomatoes ratings were so bad).However, I kind of liked the movie. There was some really good cinematography and acting in the movie (e.g. the background music was always relevant and helped build the mood of the film). It was very engaging, able to show various perspectives of life through the eyes of different people (though the multiple subplots had been somewhat confusing at first). The debate itself about God's existence raised some very good points, points that both strengthened my faith (I am a Christian) and made me rethink my beliefs. Josh argued using three points: the creation of the universe, the evolution of life, and the existence of evilness and morality. He used various quotes and logical reasoning to back his claim (e.g. \"If God does not exist then everything is permissible.\", \"Nature does not jump.\") He was able to refute Professor Radisson's use of a Steven Hawking quote, using Hawking's \"philosophy is dead\" quote to undermine his credibility (after all, they were in a philosophy class). The subplots of the movie were slotted in quite nicely to emphasize a certain message of a scene, most of them elaborating about faith. The film could be quite moving at times, but also unrealistic. The plot is centered around Professor Radisson's hatred and anger towards God because his mother had died when he was twelve, despite his pleading for God to spare her. This makes it seem like all atheists do not believe in God because they had some past grievances (which is not true). To quote Radisson, \"you will find that the most committed atheists were once Christians\", which I find doubtful though it could have some truth to it. All in all, I think \"God's Not Dead\" is a good movie for Christians to watch because it will strengthen their faith. However, it is not recommended for atheists or Muslims because it is extremely biased and could be offending.",

The movie claims to share this value but also stops at nothing to paint Atheists, Muslims, etc. as negatively as possible. The self-righteousness of those who made this movie is utterly disgusting. To pass judgement unto those who believe in anything other than what Christians believe in goes directly against the teachings of the Bible.Atheism, Islam, and practically every other belief system is just as legitimate as Christianity. Why? Because NO RELIGION IS FACT. THEY ARE BASED UPON A SET OF BELIEFS THAT CANNOT BE PROVEN OR DISPROVEN. Despite this, however, this movie stops at nothing to try to scientifically argue in favor of Christianity.I'm not here to claim that people can be judged as moral or immoral by what they believe in, because - unless you find good in inherently immoral things such as murder - it is no one's right to make that assumption. Living in Mississippi, most people I know are Christian. Most people I know are also good people, Christian or not. I just take issue with the sense of entitlement shared by some evangelicals. To act like there is only one truly correct belief system and it is your duty to convert the wayward ones who don't believe in it is astronomically condescending.In short, believe in what you want to believe in and don't act like your beliefs are somehow more correct than someone else's. They are beliefs because they can't be proven, so no religion is more right or wrong than another.And yes, Atheism is a religion. There are many other religions out there with no God. However, Agnosticism isn't. Agnosticism is more the choice to not believe in any religion. I follow it because, with the near infinite possibilities of what may happen after we die (including nothing), to me, there is simply no point in spending time on Earth to try to figure it out.
