I will say it has ambition in opening up this world into a mafia drama rather than another claustrophobic thrill-ride. The mob aspect of the plot might be generic and cliched at times but overall that part was surprisingly more engaging than some American movies of that kind. But we watch this for the action and it was insanely savage! We are talking level-11 sh-t here; high-speed pacing, masterful choreography and brutal as hell. Fight sequences that put most action movies to shame!!\n......................................\nTHE RAID 2 QUOTES\nYou Apologize to them in their languages, in our land. Where is your honor!",

But very few of them blow me away, and the ones that do so tend to be the really intense thrillers that are packed with suspense and absolutely great action scenes. THE RAID was a great movie which I really enjoyed, and I heard the hype about the sequel but was afraid to believe it. I needn't have been; THE RAID 2 is an absolutely brilliant movie and one of the best films I've ever seen.This sequel doesn't slavishly copy the original, which is a good thing. Instead, it's a sprawling gangster movie, an Indonesian variant of the ones popular in Hong Kong and South Korea, enlivened with some incredibly violent and extremely well choreographed action sequences which usually take the \"one vs. many\" formula to the extreme. This stuff is great in itself, enlivened with larger than life characters and more depth than you'd expect from a typical thriller.Stuff continues in this vein up until the last forty five minutes, at which point you realise that everything preceding this point was just the build up to the denouement, which is an action spectacular unlike anything ever put on film. There's a stupendous car chase, a great three-way between top fighters, and the final kitchen one on one, which I think might well be the best fight ever put on film (and I've seen most of the Bruce Lee/Donnie Yen/Jackie Chan/Tony Jaa fights). Everything is perfect: the choreography, the music, the violence. Iko Uwais and Gareth Evans both go from strength to strength and everything just gels together perfectly. Go buy this now, you won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "The Raid: Redemption was such a success and regarded by many people as one of the best action movies of 2012, and the sequel is likely to end the year 2014 as the best action movie of the year. It's pretty much different than the first movie, in this one there was actually a story. This movie is a great combination of a gangster flick with a very well coordinated martial arts.The director Gareth Evans is masterful at filming incredible action sequences, probably better than ANY Hollywood directors working right now. It is inspiring how he managed to make such unbelievable fight scenes, and car chase in a such limited budget. The cast were good in delivering the good, the dialogue was fairly good, the choreography were Spectacular! Not to mention the unforgettable cinematography that was brilliantly managed by people who knows what they're doing.The only downside is perhaps the running time which could have been shortened 15-20 minutes, but you will still always be entertained while watching this movie.Overall, The Raid 2 is arguably one of the best sequels ever, and even one of the best martial arts movies ever. It's superior to its predecessor in terms of story telling, considering the running time, and the choreography was also quite a bit improved from the already unforgettable moves in the first one. It had more action and violence than the previous one, although less action percentage-wise. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. It has everything a perfect martial arts movie has to have, and it deserves to be regarded as one of the best in its genre. I hope that the director Gareth Evans would make more films with a higher budget to showcase to the world his true potential as a director, and it'd be great to have it featuring Iko Uwais, that could be an icon for years to come.",

So while I was watching this sequel my heart was beating very fast and the adrenaline was pumping. It takes place 2 hours after where the first one ended. Swear to god every time there was a fight on I felt it and I kept shaking. The scene that had me pumped was the train scene and the prison fight. There is a lot of martial artist involved in this film which makes me love it even more because they use real stunt men and this movie just requires skill. This is by far the best action movie sequel ever produced and I hope it gets noticed by everyone around the world. Best one on one showdown in the end. If you love action movies and would love to turn your brain off for a moment then this is your candy. My favorite action movie ever, sorry Bruce Lee. 10/10 MUST SEE!",

I can honestly say that myself, my friend who tagged along and the audience were very very entertained!The plot continues 2 hours after the events of the first film, it places our hero into another intense mission to stop the baddies by going undercover for a special unit and blending in with the mob who's on the verge of war with their rivals. All I can say that follows is a orgy of brutal, bloody and intense arm-breaking, leg-snapping, hammer stomping, bat swinging, blade slashing, head blowing, bullet-loaded and arse kicking violence in a dash of Tarantino and Scorsese story-telling in its plot. The choreographed fights are all intense and realistic with the climatic showdown towards the last half hour of the film being the best sequences filmed on camera.Overall, its a bloody amazing film to be released in 2014 and its a definite return for the genre too! I'm definitely keen to see this again when its out officially later this week!",

            "content": "Having watched and enjoyed the first film, also with all its hype i heard, I excitingly went to watch The Raid 2: Berandal this afternoon. In the first 5 minutes, there're some shocks especially for the viewers who've watched the first film. The aftermath of the 1st film was told in brief to give the background plot for Rama the protagonist character. So it's basically recommended for the viewers to watch the first film before watching. With quite many characters're being involved, to make it less easier for the viewers to identify the characters, most of them only have short names and unique names (although it got me confused a little at some time till i was finally able to know them all). The most important key throughout this film's its violent top-notch fighting choreography which's jaw dropping and breath-taking. Also the view take (cinematic technique) in this film's simply marvelous, one which i really enjoyed's the car chase scene. It's such a superb performance to take those kinds of angles. I tell you, the story's a bit much equivalent with as if a mixing of \"The Departed\" + \"The Godfather\" + Gory Martial Arts, so in my opinion it's unwise to miss watching it. Furthermore, this sequel is indeed a confirming proof that Gareth Evans's undoubtedly an experienced and adept action film writer-director whom i think should be eyed and wanted by the Hollywood producers to direct/write decent action movies, with martial arts but perhaps less violent. Iko Uwais, although his total screen-time percentage's less (reduced because of the more complicated story n characters) compared with the first film and the role of his character is, didn't lose his hero persona, he constantly showed off his skills in the martial arts by fighting tons of enemies, got a bit improved in his acting (thanks to the story with its more dialogues).I urgedly forbid any parent to bring their young little children to watch this movie. Also for the viewers with weak-stomachs (anti-violence) definitely might want to reconsider and avoid watching this film, because it's utterly quite gruesome. After the film ended, you might find yourselves asking about some things which're left unsure and dubious. So gotta keep your eyes out for the continuation in the next last film of the planned trilogy which i reckon must've not come out yet at least not until 2017.A must-see film for the action movie fans.9/10",

The action might take up a little less screen time percentage wise, but is more brutal (way more), even better choreographed, varied and memorable. I think this movie has the greatest overall collection of fight scenes in the history of action cinema, and a fantastic car chase too. Obviously I haven't seen every movie in existence, but I have never seen anything with such a collection of incredibly well done and brutal fights. Characters have depth to them, even if on a comic book level, and are well cast and well played. Story is fairly intelligent, and more than services the action. Everything else; filming, editing, sound design, stunts, special effects are stellar. There are quite a few \"how the hell did they do that?!?\" moments.",

            "content": "I was lucky enough to catch a limited release screening of this film here in Australia as I was in high anticipation to see it after more than enjoying the first Raid film and in no way was I disappointed with this film. This is honestly, by far, one of the best sequels in existence today. The isolated first film is completely removed of all boundaries and expanded it to this ultra-violent masterpiece. First the possible negatives for some people; this movie is very long and structured differently to the first (Beginning Story - Action Centre - Ending Story) this film follows a back and forth style of (Story - Action - Story - Action) so the accumulation of story is quite large meaning a lot of reading for English viewers. Another possible negative is the fact this film feels almost nothing like the first film, the first being like an action survival story while this film is an action, espionage, martial arts film filled with gangs and all different personalities though in my opinion this gives the film a fresh style for viewers. If you were expecting same old style you may be disappointed but there is an American remake of the first film in production. The final possible negative is the vast amount of brutal and graphic violence throughout the film, this is one of the most violent action films I have ever seen but I enjoy the extreme violence side of cinema but those with a light stomach may find this film difficult for the sheer amount of blood there is in this movie in comparison to the first. These negatives in my eyes are strong points for the film in my eyes but to others might not be. To the positives which there are plenty of, firstly and most important; the action. As you probably would've expected the action in this film is the greatest bone crunching action you will most likely see in your whole life, its gritty and incredibly well planned style makes it like a form of bloody art. Gareth Evans knows exactly what he is doing here. One of my favorite aspects of the films was the direction. The slow pans and zooms Evans uses to build suspense as well as a perfect use of slow motion, not over the top in any way, just give the film an added visual style which boosts it even further. Evans also knows exactly how to build up an action scene, one of my absolute favorite fight scenes in the film in the prison yard fight which is so incredibly well choreographed whilst having this dark and suspenseful build up to the fight. This film try's a lot of new things and all of which work for example are car chase scene which is one of the best I've seen in any movie. The story in this film delivers what the first film was lacking, putting characters in the flesh and making you care a lot more, even for the villains. And with good story and characters of course comes excellent acting which is often rare in action films, these actors are absolutely teeming with talent, all of which can act and can fight. As I read the credits I could only see two stunt doubles for the whole film which is saying something. This is an absolute must see for any action film fan, it is nothing short of a masterpiece and needs to receive the credit it absolutely deserves",

Well both points can be defended; but in any case, you go to this movie to the outstanding skills of the fighter in this case are really out of this world. Think in a more human but ten times faster Bruce Lee.The first Raid was basically a glorified video game with a couple of twist that made the movie interesting. In this case, there is a real story and many things are really unexpected and very well thought about.The movie is 30 or more minutes longer than the first one which is mostly used for setups and character development; however the level of violence higher and realism of the fights is shocking. Fights are filmed in very long takes but fast takes with no visible editing or digital makeover. Your brain believe everything as if it was seen by your own eyes.This is the kind of movie cannot be made in USA. Insurances will not allow this kind of stunt work and will end in a fake digital scenes without any kind of realism.Even the acting is decent enough. The bad guys have the required level of menace; and the stoic hero looks defenseless against all that (he is not at all).In brief; if you look for hard adrenaline entertainment, forget Captain America or any other PG 13 action movie and go for this one. You will have to read subtitles; but it is really a minimum price for the best 2.5 hours of pure action you will ever find.",

It was amazing to hear how the editing had just finished (on Sunday) only a couple days before the first screening (on Tuesday)for Sundance. The level of expectations of surpassing the Raid: Redemption will not disappoint any action junkies. A barrage of set-action sequences from a muddy prison (uncontrollable chaos) to several people being decimate with the use of a baseball bat and a pair of claw hammers (with close-up gore that can only rival horror movies), a fantastic car chase that might have been the one of the very best choreographed sequence in recent memory and a final fight scene that will leave you breathless from its intensity and insanity.The plot is of a familiar \"storyline\", yet there are somber moments from a few characters that help drive the emotional aspect (especially from the main character's quiet reconnection with his family). It does feel a bit choppy in certain scenes but, for a 2 1/2 hr movie, it really does fly on by.The final fight scene completely out-shined the first Raid. Quite honestly, it really was an edge-of-your-seat moment. As the director explains his reason of making such a movie during a Q&A, (paraphrasing) \"I wanted to make a movie that I wanted to see and hopefully there'll be several hundred people who will enjoy it too.\"",

            "content": "The first movie 'The Raid: Redemption' set the bar for action movies. With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.With 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.Evans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.The fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.When I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.If you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.Overall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.",

The first film was an extremely satisfying, virtually plot-free, relentlessly brutal fight-fest that left the viewer gasping for breath, but the sequel is so much more than that\u2014a densely plotted, visually stunning, brilliantly acted, wonderfully controlled piece of drama with richly drawn characters that gradually morphs into an insanely violent, incredibly gory (so much blood!) and utterly exhilarating stunt-packed martial-arts/action masterpiece, one that re-defines the entire genre.Reminiscent of the Hong Kong heroic bloodshed genre (particularly those films by John Woo) and numerous Japanese Yakuza films, the plot explores the familiar themes of respect, honour and betrayal and features characters for whom the line between good and bad have become blurred. In terms of drama, it's up there with A Better Tomorrow and The Killer. However, in terms of action, it leaves these films in the dust (hard to believe, I know), with countless flawlessly executed scenes that put the viewer right in the midst of the m\u00eal\u00e9e, where each and every punch, kick, stab and slice can be experienced in extreme blood-drenched close-up.Pitted against some of the most awesome cinematic baddies ever realised (the likes of which will have Tarantino crying into his coffee knowing that he has forever been trumped by a Welshman), Iko Uwais, as undercover cop Rama, is simply amazing\u2014one of the most physically impressive action movie stars I have ever witnessed\u2014while Director Gareth Evans displays an understanding of his visual medium that I find difficult to comprehend, every scene executed with the utmost of care and skill, whether it be a simple lingering shot of a leaf in a field (before the inevitable explosion of violence) or a jaw-dropping, breakneck car chase (my personal favourite moment); together, they have taken the art of the action movie to a whole new level.

Bloodletting runs high, in action sequences, some real orgies of carnage. For action fans it's a must see, running just over two and a half hours, like a few other films around the traps at the moment. Having not seen the first Raid film, which I know, wouldn't be as gruesome as this, I was entertained to the max. There's nothing like a watching a cool and great action film, but with all the other things as well. Rama, our hero, who's part of an anti police corruption division is forced to go undercover again, playing the role, first subjecting himself to some prison time, where this guy can really fight at blinding velocity, you'll feel your hurt hurting a few times. Now after two years he's out, and is welcomed into the family, on account of a prisoner (the son of the mafia boss, Bejo) he looked after. This mafia consists of some dirty cops, which is Rama's objective to weed them out. Featuring one of the greatest car chase sequences, with breakneck suspense, and endless stunts, it almost has you breathless, where action keeps frequently coming, versus the violence in great quantity, the highlight pinnacle scene, involving a head almost completely blown off. As to the end, it's one that leaves your mind wandering, where really it wasn't satisfying, which will lead the viewer to a few assessments about who's corrupt and who isn't. So in this case, it really works. The film also has great music scores, some Asian hotties, some good acting, a little silhouetted sex/porn making, and one scene throbbing with music, you would feel your head buckle a little under it, or squinting a little, all part of the course. The film has some good ole Asian humour too, like you would expect from these, plus an Asian villainess, never more deadlier with hammers. An action spectacular you must witness, that will leave you awed, or many other words, that fit the nature of the definition.",

            "content": "((From: http://thinmanmoviereviews.wordpress.com/)) In 2011, Welsh director Gareth Evans gave us \"The Raid: Redemption\" \u2013 one of the best pure action films of the last decade \u2013 and hinted at his potential to be a new and exciting presence in the writer/director realm. The action was hard-hitting, lightning fast, supporting a simple, contained story of one man fighting against an entire tower of enemies in a way that was reminiscent of classics like \"Die Hard\". Well, if \"The Raid\" was one of the best action films of the last ten years, Evans' follow-up film \"The Raid 2\u2033 has now set the standard for the next twenty. In fact, I'm going to make a bold statement that you can feel free to quote me on:\"The Raid 2\u2033 is the best action movie ever made.Where sequels are concerned, this film does absolutely everything right. It takes the frenetic energy of the original, contained within the twenty-story drug den in which it took place, and lets it loose across the urban sprawl of an entire city teeming with warring crime syndicates, corrupt police officers, and the civilians often caught in the crossfire. No longer contained to just one address, the fight scenes in \"Raid 2\u2033 cover car chases, cramped subway trains, muddy prison yards, night clubs, and city streets, and every action set piece hits all the right notes. Every punch thrown and bullet fired is made even more effective by the fact that all of the action is done practically. In an era where so much of the action that we see on screen is dominated by the CGI-centric explosion extravaganzas of Michael Bay and the like it's incredibly refreshing to see highly trained stunt professionals being pushed to their limits to deliver a collection of the best action scenes in modern memory. Much of this work is shouldered by the film's lead, Indonesian-born Iko Uwais, the returning star of the first \"Raid\". Uwais is reminiscent of a younger Jet Li or \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 Bruce Lee; moving with such self-assured speed and practiced precision that every move deserves multiple looks to take in all the details. The comparison to Lee is bolstered by \"The Raid 2\u2033's finale, which plays out like the final gatecrashing act of \"Game of Death\", in which our hero has to slug his way through opponents of increasing lethality. Unlike \"Game of Death\", \"The Raid 2\u2033 lets us see our villains in action almost as often as our hero, and it's a credit to Evans as writer/director that each of these characters is absolutely dripping with charisma and cool. There are no wasted characters here; we love every hero and love to hate every villain.The script is, with few exceptions, always on-point. What could have simply been a straight-forward action flick with minimal plot to carry us from one action set-piece to another is instead a mad whirlwind of conspiracy, murder, and double and triple-crosses, steadily ratcheting up the tension to the film's explosive conclusion. From a technical standpoint, the impressive cinematography matches the action stride-for- stride and, looking back, there are a dizzying number of wildly choreographed long-takes that put every nuance of the environment, characters, and action on display. Combine this with a pulse-pounding soundtrack and some absolutely superb practical makeup effects accompanying every injury, no matter how small, and \"The Raid 2\u2033 is the complete package. With a third film already in the works, making this a trilogy, Hollywood has been put on notice: Gareth Evans has arrived; he's just dramatically changed the landscape of action films and shows no signs of pulling any punches.

            "content": "The first Raid remains one of my favorite action films of all time. It's a ruthless, brutal, and realistic approach to action films. So, it's hard to believe that they could top the film. And yet, they did, in almost every way. From a deeper story and plot, to more bone crunching, blood letting violence, everything here is bigger, better, and hits harder.Picking up pretty much where the last one left off, our hero Rama is the last survivor of the original film and is wanted by a special, small law enforcement group attempting to out crooked cops. They want to use Rama to go undercover and get close to the head of the organized crime gangs in Jakarta in an effort to uncover names. What follows is a twisted plot of shifting alliances, as our hero navigates the underworld while punching, kicking, kneeing, and elbowing everything that gets in his way.While the first film was confined to a single location with lots of closed in fights, this is all out, balls to the wall action that has little boundaries. And none of it is very pretty either. While stylized, this film continues the bone crunching, hard hitting, blood shedding violence of the first one. There are no soft punches here. There are some moments so hard hitting, you'll have expletives leaking out of your mouth. And once again, the true hero here is Gareth Evans, who is saving action films with a superior touch. His cinematography is fantastic, as is the editing which adds tension and suspense to every fight. And much like the first film, the action is greatly varied, but different enough from the first film that it never feels like we've seen it all before. Opening up the film to an entire city, we get a fantastic car chase scene and several changes of scenery. These are some of the most memorable action scenes captured on film, ones you will keep thinking about as you leave the theater.But beyond this, a lot of other things have improved as well. The plot, while not all that original, does make strides in having some complexity and making Rama more sympathetic. For as brutal as the first film was, this film truly makes it seem like Rama isn't entirely safe. Yes, we believe he will win all his fights, but not without shedding some serious blood. It gets to the point that we're not entirely sure he'll survive in the end. But Rama is still a complete badass and every bit the action hero, but still coming off as more human than the average hero.My one, minor gripe with the film is the pacing. The film is about an hour longer than the first one, with about as much action. This gives for a bit of a slow down. But again, that's a minor complaint. There's still more than enough fantastic action. Here's to hoping there's more Raid films in the future. This is, as far as I am concerned, a near perfect action film and I can't get enough.

With the first film, I did think that perhaps it struggled to carry almost an hour less than this, with its rather base plotting, so I was ready to say that Raid 2 has no business being so long. However \u2013 it does and it easily makes the time fly.Although some films make great use of enclosed locations and struggle to perhaps make things work once given more freedom, the open world given to The Raid 2 seems to have greatly benefited it. In terms of narrative we get a bit more actual development and structure to it, with the main character much more involved than simply fighting his way up to the boss level like a video game; this drew me in a bit more but it also serves as a very good frame for plenty of action sequence. What it also does is open up an endless variety to these sequences \u2013 where the first film benefited and was limited by the tower block location, this film has car chases, prison riots, nightclubs, massacres on trains \u2013 a lot of different locations and characters that really do prevent it feel repetitive even if it is ultimately mostly action.One thing that is easy to miss while being caught up in the action is the reason why you are caught up in it \u2013 and that is the technical delivery. I'm no filmmaker (probably didn't need to be said) but I watch a lot of films and I can appreciate when things like sound and camera work are well done. In the case of Raid 2 it is astonishing what the camera does; whether some of it is CGI or not I do not know but the movement of the camera in and around the action makes it feel like the position of the steadicam operator was as important in the fight choreography as the position of the actors. The film doesn't leave it long for you to discover this, because the prison riot is tremendous, with brutal action but hugely impressive camera movement and coordination. This continues throughout the film and I really did love the sweeping camera movements in and around the action.In terms of the action, it should be said that it is violent \u2013 incredibly violent. I am not one of these people who get upset because an action movie got a low rating and start mumbling about selling out etc, however I did watch this film a few days after going to see Expendables 3 and, while the latter was distractingly noisy, it did make me wonder why on earth Stallone wouldn't want his film to be as good as Raid 2? I not only watched this impressed by the filming of the action sequences and the choreography of them, but the sheer intensity and, yes, blood and violence of them also grabbed me. I watch many action movies as a passive affair since they require little thought and generally allow me to do chores at the same time; for this one though I was regularly engaged and gasping at the action (well \u2013 cursing more than gasping). It isn't that bloody violence made this a good film, but it really does make it that much more impacting. Raid 2 is long and this can be off-putting, but it mostly carries its running time very well, justifying it with plot and, mainly, action. The many sequences are fast, brutal, brilliantly choreographed and filmed with a fluidity and engagement of the camera that even laymen such as I will be impressed. The film has flaws but ultimately you came for an action movie and in Raid 2 you get an excellent one.",

Our hero is basically told he has found one little fish and the police want him to go very undercover and weed out the bigger fish. That's essentially the story where Rama is tasked with befriending the big boss's son who is in prison. One of the things I love about this movie is the director appreciates the talent he has available and he uses it. I can picture his direction being \"right you know what you can do, have fun and I'll roll the camera and let you guys do your stuff\". Simply put that would have worked. There is yet again a lot of brilliant martial arts in this movie, very little gun play compared to the first one, quite honestly this could be a stand alone film. The story is different to the raid but is still great. Only criticism I would consider is that the films a bit long but I did enjoy it so didn't really care. A word of warning this is not a martial arts movie you get the kids to watch it is very brutal the action looks very bloody and the weapon work is very realistic/close quarter. This movie makes a lot of 18 rated films look tame. Enjoy it and if you study martial arts you will love it",

            "content": "The much anticipated sequel to The Raid tries its damnedest to up the ante in every way. It cannot help but fall short - the original was almost a perfect martial arts film, so simple, so quick moving. The sequel creates a far more complex - though also fairly clich\u00e9 - story. Rama (Iko Uwais) is now going undercover in the mob with the hopes that he'll expose police corruption. This falls apart pretty quickly, though. He becomes too entrenched in the family drama between mob boss Tio Pakusodewo and his ambitious, hotheaded son, Arifin Putra. When Putra gets his gang in an all-out mob war, Uwais has no option but to try his best to survive the massacre. The film moves a bit more deliberately than the first Raid (though that one spent a long time building before the action really kicked into gear, too), with a lot of quiet, suspenseful moments before the violence erupts. I definitely wouldn't say it's boring, but it does feel a tad less efficient than the original. Still, when the action really starts moving, it is every bit as break-neck. Occasionally the camera movements get a bit too shaky, but, for the most part, the action isn't difficult to follow and it's both gripping and brutal. There's a car chase sequence in the second half of the film that easily ranks as one of the best action sequences ever, and I wanted even more of Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man. All in all, I wouldn't rank this too far below the original The Raid. If you liked that one, you'll definitely want to see this one. And I'll be first in line for #3.",

I went into Raid 2 with bated breath, and I guess I was happy just to see a repeat performance of the first film ie. a ton of action, and a few gory kills. Turns out though, I totally didn't expect a fantastic storyline into the bargain, which elevated this film way beyond the towering levels (pardon the pun) of it's part one.Raid 2 is just plain magnificent. Imagine if Goodfellas was made with martial arts, rather than guns, this is what you get. Three crime families/syndicates hold a reasonably decent truce, until the son of one family decides he wants a bigger slice of the pie than he's being given. Throw in some police corruption, some prison action, and our hero from the first movie sent to infiltrate what's going on, and you're in for some astounding thrills. Hollywood is dead, all hail the Asian kings.The beauty of The Raid 2 is unquestionable. There's a final showdown in a kitchen which runs like a ballet of death to it's bloodied conclusion. As it reached it's resolve, I almost felt myself well up in tears at it's awesome depiction of gorgeous, violent, killing. Sure, no one could actually survive the injuries received in some of these fights, but when you have films like Crouching Tiger winning awards for people running across rooftops on tippy-toes and flying ridiculously through the sky, The Raids fights are realistic in comparison. It's all about escapism isn't it?I don't want to spoil anything, but this movie is long, it's one hell of an epic story, and rather than the violence being the sole driving force of the film it's equalled by the drama. Let's face it, the plot of the first Raid movie could be written in one sentence, not this time however. So be prepared for that. I saw 3 popcorn munching guys in front of me check their pathetic Facebook pages on several occasions because their tiny little brains couldn't cope with the concentration beyond 90 minutes. For those even slightly versed in Asian cinema however it's a bloody blast from the first scene to the last.Favourite moments abound, of which I will just refer to fleetingly. The prison mudfight, car chase, hammer girl, baseball man, a machine gun in a crash helmet, and that final kitchen fight scene....wow! Also, to save you a little confusion, the Koso character isn't who you think he is. Yes THAT guy did die in part one. Had me a bit lost also. Not sure at this point why he's in there again, but in some ways it would have been good if he was the same guy as the background story you learn about him was quite sad actually. Anyway, no action movie will beat the Raid 2 this year. That's guaranteed. Yes we have Godzilla coming, but big monsters just don't spell action like this does. And will there be a Raid 3? I think the intention always was for a trilogy to take place, so it's probably nailed on. I for one can't wait",

And the villain is such a stupid man you almost can't believe it, ruthless he may be.But I watched this film in part in the context of other action films, especially ones as of late. Evans moves his camera and his actors fast, and edits himself. Somehow though when the hand-held camera ops move things and go hand-held, it has purpose, it has drive, you know where everyone is in relation to one another, and there is not, far as I can tell, a drop of CGI blood spilt.And it's not for the weak at heart. This is bone crunching, throat slitting, gun blasting, car smashing, set demolishing and head splattering violence. And I think a major point of the movie, in its theme as well as the physical nature of it, is this: you fight someone, or tens, or hundreds of people and kill many of them, it never ends. The violence here is the thrilling \"Movie\" kind of violence that is fun, but this come a closer to a visceral mania and danger one might see in Peckinpah, as opposed to a Taken or James Bond movie. And its with martial arts too. Oh boy it is.Evans IS indulging here, maybe more so in the story than the action, which is saying a lot. I didn't expect to get majorly involved with the emotional life of the characters, but these are well drawn people on the whole. Of course there are also the types, the strong willed but (with a code) fair crime boss, his terrible progeny, and sinister side characters. These people are also here to accentuate the hero, Rama, who we are with every step of the way just for how deep undercover he's put into this crime family.Again, nothing revolutionary with the story, but there is enough there - as there was in the first Raid - to keep a foundation for the action to spring from. And Evans isn't f***ing about here - this is action and fighting that is meant to push the envelope for what you can do in a fight, how far you can take the actors and stunt men until (or maybe it becomes) a cartoon springs forth, including a henchman - and hench-woman - who look closer to being in a Tarantino flick with a bat and hammers ready to kill. brutally.We believe this main character as a person who really, actually, doesn't want to fight, but the situations he's put in... well, watch your head. Or your arms, or legs, or neck, or feet, or most other body parts. I believed he could do this, as in the first film, and it drove everything else to come. And as just a regular actor he can hold his own, within the dimensions of the script as it is. But what do these never-ending cycles of violence portend? even the ending seems to indicate it just won't stop.The Raid 2 plunges us through hard boiled genre fiction into a completely corrupt society. And if you don't know how to fight, get out of the kitchen (no, really, get out, those two gentlemen have something they need to so). The Raid 2 is a superb, largely coherent and appropriately bleak example of what the genre can hold, and if it has imperfections in little moments it gets everything else so right that it's hard to carp. Its that overused critical expression - jaw dropping.",

It was one of my favorite action films of all time. The gritty realism, the subtle story and fleshed out characters (by action movie standards at the very least). It was the best action movie I saw in 2011.I can gladly say that the sequel is in my opinion better than the original (although the original is still amazing in my book). The action of course is bigger and more intricate. The Direction is beautifully done, the fight scenes are very tense and brutal the movements of the camera and the viewing angles used are dynamic. The set pieces were very varied. Where the original was confined to an apartment complex, the sequel has varied locations around Jakarta and the environments for the fights keep the action feeling fresh through out.I am also glad that the story was bulked up in this entry as well. Many action movies make the mistake of allowing the action to completely take over the movie throwing the story out of the window. The Raid 2 is not one of those, the story here is way more complex than the original. I can already foresee people complaining about the story being unnecessarily complicated. Although I would disagree, sure the movie throws a lot of names at the viewer however I felt confident of my understanding of the story which I would like to avoid talking about in my review to avoid spoilers. I enjoyed the story I felt invested in Rama and Ucok was a very interesting character as well.I would just like to urge any fans of the original or any fans of action movies in general to please go see this movie. I feel that in this age of cookie cutter Hollywood movies that this is a breath of inspired fresh air. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this movie I do not think you will regret it. I would also like to express my support of both Gareth Evans and actor Iko Uwais The Raid and now the sequel are two of the best action movies I have ever seen I hope their partnership continues and they get to bring the world many more amazing movies.

There was not much of a story to get in the way and the action was so well choreographed - proving that you don't need a massive Hollywood budget to make a solidly entertaining film. I saw the second one this weekend expecting to see more of the same. But this is one of those rare occasions where the sequel is superior to the original in every way.The story follows directly from the ending of The Raid. The protagonist agrees to an undercover mission to infiltrate the criminal underworld. Think Scorsese's The Departed. He gets trapped in a brewing conflict between rival gangs and meets enough colourful characters along the way to make Quentin Tarantino proud. Moreover, the fight scenes are bigger and, generally, even better than the first. Some of them are a little hard to follow as the camera makes it difficult to follow each character but they have been expertly choreographed and blew me away at times. In fact, the film seems to combine Scorsese's storytelling with Tarantino's flare with Indonesian martial arts scenes to create a brilliant mix. I won't spoil the story for anyone but I highly recommend it despite the fact that it may get a little complicated with so many characters and motivations.By now, you probably have an idea of how this is different from the first. That is to say that there is an actual story. It isn't in one setting and there are so many more complex characters. This may disappoint those looking for a retread of the first Raid because it is just so different but I like the fact that it was different and didn't just try to cash in on the original. They are so different, in fact, that I would say you don't really need to see the first film to be able to follow and enjoy this one. This one definitely takes its time to pick up, allowing the first hour or so for character exposition. But I have no problem with that and, as I said, when the action starts it is every bit as exciting as the first.I really do recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a real action film without all the Hollywood CGI and for anyone who enjoys Scorsese, Tarantino, or just martial arts or gangster films. There is something here for most people and it comes with my highest recommendation. It makes the first film feel like a prologue to the real film, The Raid 2",

With The Raid's standing in the genre now well and truly set this larger follow up had hype a plenty that was justified with a great reception at its Sundance premiere and now in general release fans of the first can now make up their mind as to how this crime/action epic stacks up to its loved predecessor. After sitting on my thoughts for a few days now I finally feel confident in expressing my particular thoughts on what could be the year's most memorable movie.The Raid 2: Berandal (which stands for Thug or Thugs in Indonesian) is a massive step up in scope and territory for not only its writer/director in Evans but his cast which features the stars of the first entry Iko Uwais and everyone's favourite Mad Dog Yayan Ruhian in a new role as \"The Assassin\" plus a raft of new members. Evans clearly buoyed by the success of his first Raid entry has here created a crime opus that is not dissimilar to some type of Scorsese/Tarantino piece filled with biting violence and equally snarky comical moments and scripting. It's a brave move by Evans to create such a piece around the action that made the first movie such a breath of fresh and often blood filled air and at times sadly it does feel like there is more exposition here than was needed that stops the movie from being a full on borderline perfect action tale. To pick faults with ambition is a petty thing however when so much of the Raid 2 is above and beyond anything you have seen or are likely to see in the future both near and far.The scope and vision spoken about earlier appears so frequently throughout this movie that it almost could be taken for granted but what watchers of this film are privy to is a film that boasts action set pieces that defy logic to be bigger and better than the one before all culminating in what can only be described as one of the best car chases of recent memory and a kitchen set 2 man fight that is all types of amazing (the cinema audience I sat in with was well and truly up on their feet and clapping by this moment, and in truth most of the movie). To mention merely these set ups though is taking away from all the previous entries which in any other movie would be enough to make it a must see. Credit needs to go to Evan's and his star Uwais who have shown considerable growth since the first outing with Evans showcasing an incredible vision as a director which well and truly sets him up as one of the most unique and talented working today while Uwais should be proud of his growth as an actor that should set him up in good stead to have a long a hopefully great career in the genre.There are pacing issues in this film and despite not possessing the original films unique charms and set up along with the firsts complete out of the blue appearance for many, The Raid 2 is still seriously jaw-dropping stuff that a cinema full of clapping, cheering and at many times wincing audience members can attest to. Evans and Uwais have yet again raised the bar for what we can expect from them but one feels there far from finished and the movie world is all the better for it. After this particular cinema experience you'll never look at an action movie in the same way along with your everyday claw hammer, baseball or box cutter.5 muddy prison brawls out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

What just might be the most complete action film of any kind since Legend of Drunken Master back in 1994, this movie contains so much action, so much mayhem, so much brutal violence that it will make Sylvester Stallone shutter. And it's not just the quantity, it's also the quality. No CGI overkill here, you will feel every hit, punch, kick, stab, crash, burn, and baseball (trust me) thrown at all the characters involved. You have been warned----none of this is pretty in the least bit. Not for the faint of heart. Even the closing credits use red.For fans of The Raid, the sequel might take some time to get used to. After all, the original was a fast-paced claustrophobic trip that was essentially fight first, plot later. Felt like a cinematic video game, progressing in difficulty before reaching the jaw-dropping climax. In the sequel, we have a heavier story with more characters, and far more open space. So the big question is are you willing to sacrifice a few action bits just to condense the story that involves an arsenal of gang members and crooked men double-crossing each other left and right in a city overrun by corruption and crime lords? No you're not.Yes, the story has far more dialogue, and moves as a slower pace than the predecessor. But it still gives us an intriguing story that lacks predictability, and gives more personality to most of the characters, including our lead character Rama. But let's be truthful, you aren't here because of story. You aren't here for the themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and family. You aren't here for Oscar-like material. You are here to see as much carnage as legally possible within a certain timeframe.And boy, does it deliver.Containing just as much action as in the original (although it was spaced out far more because of time length and storytelling elements in between), The Raid 2 is flawlessly directed and edited by Gareth Evans (easily rising as among the top directors in the world) as every single gunfight, fistfight, and chase sequence is delivered with just enough creativity, bloodshed, and content to satisfy any action fan. And the action does indeed escalate in intensity and gleeful pandemonium as we progress towards the climax---which delivers two of among the best fights this entire century. Hammer Girl, Baseball Boy, and The Assassin will make an impression on you.The Raid 2 arrives at hungry action moviegoers like a rare steak---bloody, chewy, raw, and not made to satisfy everyone's tastes. It doesn't have the pure mindlessness of the predecessor, but the meaty plot intertwined with the no-holds-barred-in-your-face-visually-stimulating viciousness from Iko Uwais and friends more than makes up for the moments you might just be spending merely anticipating the next major action sequence. Like a series of city-shattering grenades with lengthy timers, The Raid 2 has you patiently waiting for each explosion. And you will never be disappointed by any of the outbursts.Just remember to breathe.",

His family is in danger and the whole country is in danger if these gangsters are not stopped soon enough. So, what does the hero do? He goes into prison, pretending to be the bad guy, punching and injuring over a hundred prisoners and guards, trying to earn the gangster's trust. After 2 years in prison, he is released and taken straight to the gang man himself. He wants in, and the gang lord simply lets him join the team. However, with some Japanese gangsters on the loose, and wanting more power, it makes it harder for our hero. With villains like \"Base ball Bat man\" and \"Hammer Girl\", it is going to be a very tough match. Can the hero get through the biggest gang war in his whole life?

It's a martial arts film fan's wet dream but I use the term martial arts loosely, because the violence goes way beyond just hand to hand combat. If you took the prolonged hammer fight scene from Oldboy and combined it with the stabbing scene at the end of American Me and threw in every blunt object possible and extended it for two and a half hours, you have The Raid 2. But underneath all of this brutality is a real story in the lines of The Departed (or Infernal Affairs if you prefer), in a real Shakespearean tragedy where everyone is doomed to die by a violent death save for the superhero that manages to fend off hordes of villains from both sides of the law with nothing but his quick reflexes.I can't imagine this making its way to mainstream American cineplexes without a boat load of editing. It's really that graphic and violent. So definitely if possible see the two and a half hour version with English subtitles. I've seen a lot of violent films so trust me when I say this one tops everything I've seen lately. Just when you think it can't get any more brutal, it does, and then some. It's reminiscent of John Woo in his early days except instead of showcasing pornographic gunplay, it's bats and pipes and broom handles and machetes and bottles and anything within arms reach.I don't even think this should be called The Raid 2 because it's misleading. This really is an epic film in its own right with not much in common with The Raid other than a few characters. If you're looking for an action film that hold absolutely nothing back, this is the one.",

            "content": "It may come as a surprise to many of you, but I do a plethora of research on a film before I commit 2 hours (or 3) to a film. One of the many benefits this has is it presets my mentality of what to expect, which clears my mind and allows for a truly distilled viewing experience. It's an awesome high, and one that lasts. But once in a while, despite my fervent research, a film will take me completely by surprise and leave me speechless. Perhaps I let my guard down due to preconceived notions I got from The Raid. And man, oh man was I taken aback. Raid 2 is a completely different film from The Raid. Gareth Evans took 4 times the budget of The Raid and made a film that is 10 times the better. The Raid is a nil- budget, decrepit looking film that takes place in a single set, featuring a campy script and non-stop action., The Raid 2 expands its focus, and adds an immensely rich and intricate storyline. As well some brutally beautiful neon-drenched cinematography, and an indie-style you- are-really-there directing style that puts you right where you need to be.The Raid 2's focus on storyline is evident by its 150 minute runtime. As our hero comes to grips that the consequences of the ass-kicking he did in the first movie has put his family at risk, he reluctantly goes undercover to take down the local kingpin families that control the scum of Indonesia. The script is brilliant, and there is a real sense the story came first, and the fight scenes were cohesively integrated in. The narrative is sublime and is purely reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick. You heard me. You aren't spoon- fed the story; you read it in the faces of the actors, and in the dialogue that is spoke. It's bizarre to witness this level of quality in this kind of film. If you enjoy getting to know a film and understanding how best to interpret it, you'll find there's much more to The Raid 2 than it's balls-out action scenes.So let's get down to it, how's the action? Compared to other martial arts films, quantity of fight scenes are few and far between. But when they come, BAM! The world blurs and your head swims as everything seems to arrive in one massive hit. It's a sustained hit too, one that keeps you pinned to your seat, blood drained from your extremities, breath held and pulse racing. The choreography is beyond anything I've ever seen, and as the script progresses and the action gets crazier, you are treated to the most extraordinary sense of otherworldly forward motion, as if you're being fired through the story by an invisible catapult.I am in literal awe of this movie. It's combination of Refn-like cinematography and Kubrick-like narrative adds a level of originality and quality that takes The Raid 2 to an unprecedented level of brilliance. The deep script makes it a cerebral process, but one spiced with perspiration and adrenalin. From beginning to end The Raid 2 is awesome with a capital F. The Raid 2 will change the world. Alright, that's a slight exaggeration. But it certainly changed mine. To be honest, I never thought I wanted or needed a film that mixed such artisan qualities with martial arts, but now that I've watched The Raid 2, I don't think things will ever be the same...",

            "content": "I open myself up to ridicule with this review. Why? because i am about to make a very broad statement. Now, i am a HUGE martial arts action movie fan. Gunfights are as boring as steamed rice to me, and grow tired of the same Hollywood approach of throwing a pretty boy muscle-clad hero as a lead role and arm him with an arsenal of weaponry. No skill, no dramatic effects, no chance for the viewer to be immersed into each scene.My broad statement is this: The Raid 2 is the biggest,the best, the most brutal and bloody action/martial arts movie i have ever seen....and I've seen everything from Bruce Lee, JCVD, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Scott Adkins, Micheal Jai White, Tony Jaa etc etcThe Raid 2 effectively takes the strongest and most appealing elements of the original film, the brutal unbridled action/fight sequences, but then magnifies them. There is no walls of confinement, no narrow passages, no limits and boundaries, just the city of Jakarta, which becomes the backdrop to some of the most incredible action sequences you will ever see on film.The story echoes the complexity and delivery of The Departed, pays homage to Internal Affairs, whilst always remaining interesting and easy to follow, which is a positive, as a movie that goes for almost 150 minutes cant be non stop action. The acting is great on all accounts, but like every martial arts/action film, you wont be reading about Oscar performances.The fight scenes..THE GLORIOUS fight scenes :) The first hour of the movie is predominantly dialog and back-story, with spot fires of fight scenes. A large scale prison riot is beautifully shot and doesn't take long for the murky, muddy prison yard to have a splash of our favorite color (red). Prior to that is a more claustrophobic scene where Iko fends off 20+ inmates who have realized he has barricaded himself in a toilet cubicle and needs to fight his way out.I wont go over each grin-inducing scene of hammer smashing, baseball bat hitting, neck slitting, car chasing, bone crushing, head stomping, shotgun blasting carnage, but i will give a special mention to the final fight scene of the movie: The Kitchen scene. Unless Gareth Evans has some tricks up his sleeve for The Raid 3, YOU WILL NOT see a more intense, fast, brutal, entertaining fight scene ever. It is hands-down the greatest moment of martial arts cinema that you will ever see. If The Raid 1 raised the bar 40 stories high, then The Raid 2 leaves the atmosphere with it.**********\\10 - Completely blown away, rivals I Saw The Devil as one of the greatest foreign movies ever made.",

            "content": "I won't lie, when I first saw The Raid I loved it, but honestly it found it to be a bit over-hyped. Maybe it was because I had heard so many great things about it that my expectations were a bit too high, but it was still the best action movie I had seen in a long time at it's release. However, The Raid 2 is one of those rare sequels that actually surpasses the first film in every way possible!Despite being a sequel, you don't really need to see the first film to understand this one. Aside from the opening scenes and the main character returning, this has absolutely nothing to do with the first film. The story here while nothing original, is an entertaining crime thriller that will hold your attention and is nice to have after the first film was so thin on plot. But story is not what will be getting audiences into the theater. Of course, it's the action and saying it delivers is an understatement. This film has hands down some of the greatest action sequences ever put on film with everything from hand-to-hand combat to quite possibly the greatest car chase sequence of all time. Even with the amazing action sequences in the first, this puts them to absolute shame. The film does not shy away from the brutality either and all the blood and gore an action fan could want is on display here. You will definitely find yourself cringing in the best way possible at more than a few of the fight scenes. Even at 2.5 hours which had me nervous for a film of this type, it never drags and actually feels about 45 minutes shorter than it actually is.Believer the hype, The Raid 2 is one of the best action films ever made!",

            "review_title": "Sequel Ups the Hardcore Action!",
            "content": "The epic first film was called \"The Raid: Redemption\", which came out in 2011. In that, a group of elite policemen, including rookie Rama and his brother Andi, conducts a raid on this dilapidated apartment building in Jakarta to apprehend a notorious crime lord. This Indonesian film shocked the action-loving audience with its audacity for unbridled violence, and they erupted in unanimous praise. Its director Gareth Evans was already being hailed as a genius, with his innovative and realistic fight scenes, which did not let up on the gore.This sequel is called \"The Raid 2: Berandal.\" While the first film was over in a quick hour and a half, this second one was an hour longer in its running time. Compared to the first where the flimsy story seemed just a mere excuse for all the action scenes to take place, this sequel takes its time to tell a more substantial story of police corruption within rival gangs. But similar to its predecessor, the fight action, violence and gore did not let up, from the very first frame up to the explosive finale. Rama is back, recruited to penetrate a bigtime local gang undercover to investigate policemen under its payroll. by gaining the trust of Uco, the son of the kingpin, Bangun. Uco is impatient to gain a bigger role in their organization, so he associates himself with a rival gangster, Bejo, to rile up conflict against another rival Japanese gang. As these criminals work under a constant cloud of mistrust and Uco's plans implode, Rama has to fight to free himself out of the violent web spun around him.From the gun and knife fights we saw from the first film, this second film ups the ante even more. There are supporting killers who use the most outlandish weapons, like hammers or a baseball bat. There are big fight scenes in the very confined spaces such as a sedan or a train car. Blood is generously flowing as usual, but here they are purposely made to contrast with the pale tan mud or a white kitchen floor or, in one head-scratching scene, even snow!The lead star Iko Uwais is as awesome a martial arts action star as he was in the first film. He was really put through the wringer in both films with all of the punishing routines he was made to do. He definitely pulls all of these scenes off spectacularly. As the main antagonist, Arifin Putra does very well also. He was very cool when he was there in that scene slicing necks. His strong half- Caucasian features add to his viciousness. Tio Pakusodewo was very good as Uco's father and gang leader Bangun. That scene where father and son were arguing about Uco's behavior was very well acted out by both actors.One of the most memorable fight scenes in the first film was that of Rama with Mad Dog, played by Yayan Ruhian. In this sequel, he makes an appearance as another memorable character Prakoso, a Bangun loyalist who was set up to be killed by Japanese gangsters. Again, Yayan's fighting skills were in full display.The Raid 2 is a very worthy sequel to an excellent first film. Conservatives might not approve of the brazen display of realistic violence, but action film fans will cheer for sure. Admittedly, a two- and-a-half hour film with subtitles is not always easy to follow, but in this one, your adrenaline will be kept pumping by the relentless action scenes. A third episode is already in the works. Pretty sure, so much anticipation is already brewing for that one.",

            "content": "The Raid 2 is quite simply one of the greatest action films ever made. In fact, if someone said to me that The Raid 2 is THE greatest action film ever made, I wouldn't argue with them. It completely blows the first Raid out of the water and somewhere into the stratosphere. In fact, Gareth Evans has swung a huge bloody baseball bat and knocked The Raid into oblivion. And I loved The Raid. When most sequels come out (mostly rubbish ones) there's usually a tagline saying, \"twice as funny\" or \"twice as thrilling\" and if The Raid 2's tagline was something along those lines it would still be a lie, because The Raid 2 is ten times better than the first Raid in just about every way that's possible. Better story, better directing, better characters, better writing, better action, better choreography and the list goes on\u0085 The Raid 2 is the best sequel since The Dark Knight.It does what every good sequel (e.g. Terminator 2, The Godfather Part II) does and doesn't simply tell the same story with a bigger budget like most sequels, but creates a brand new story which improves upon the original's that makes it a standalone film and not just \"the second one\". One of the few complaints I had for The Raid was that it had a thin plot, yet it showed positive signs of character development, which could've improved the film if Gareth tried to focus on that more. Here, the plot comes first and quite rightly so in my opinion. The Raid 2 is incredibly tightly plotted with rich characters who you'll care about and thus, making the action that much more thrilling. Oh, and talking of the action.The action in The Raid 2 is nothing short of astounding. In my opinion it beats the action sequences in the first on, thanks to the terrific and memorable set-pieces which Gareth Evans creates. These are some of the best action sequences I have ever seen on film. The directing is even stronger here, as Gareth gets more creative with where he puts the camera and how he movies it. At one point the camera follows a man as he jumps through a window and it's immense fun to watch. Instead of tight close-ups and frenetic editing (like in most Hollywood action movies) Gareth follows the action in longer takes and it's all the more intense for it, as we can actually see what's going on, as well as feel the carnage. And there is a lot of carnage.I'd go as far to say that The Raid 2 is the most violent film I've ever seen. It has serious balls and it isn't afraid to show 'em! Some serious brutality is shown pretty relentlessly and it would probably be too much for most mainstream audiences, but for hardcore lovers of the cinematic macabre, then the experience is utter bliss. You'd expect to be desensitised after 150 minutes of brutality, but you don't! Even at the all-action finale, you still feel every brutal hit and bone breakage. People are slammed with hammers and baseball bats, whilst others have their legs twisted and throats slit. What's more incredible is the way Gareth shoots this carnage. It's just shot in the most hypnotic and balletic way and is even reminiscent of John Woo's, The Killer. The choreography is also outstanding.But amongst this incredible action is a rich plot concerning the dark life of the mafia. Rama's gone undercover and befriended the son of a seriously powerful boss. Every scene is full of tension as you Rama could get found out at any moment. Just like in The Godfather, I found myself being sucked into the lives of these fascinating criminals. In fact, some of the best scenes in The Raid 2 feature no action at all. Whether it's intense discussions with mafia bosses, or a tension-fuelled encounter with some prostitutes, The Raid 2 has a brilliant and tightly wound screenplay which makes its 150 minute running time fly by.The directing throughout is nothing short of masterful. It has the look of a crime classic, and there are some of the cinematography is just breath-taking. You feel the power of these people through every shot and every shot carries meaning. There is also some brilliant use of music. One of my favourite scenes is when Rama has been shown to his apartment by the power hungry son of the mafia boss he has befriended. Rama puts on loud, sinister music and phones the police chief to reveal his anger and fear. He then puts his finger in his ear to drown out the loud music as he phones his wife for the first time and the music changes to something softer and emotionally charged. It's a powerful moment and is masterfully executed.The finale is simply mesmerising. It harks back to the first film as it's basically a series of unbelievably amazing fight scenes, only this time there's a greater weight to them as they mean so much to the plot and characters in the film. I adored the intense battle with hammer girl and baseball boy, as well as the epic kitchen fight which feels like it's going on forever. They make the Mad Dog fight at the end of the first film look like a warm-up exercise! The Raid 2 is far more than a sequel needs to be. It's much bigger and much better, which is saying a lot because the first film was absolutely brilliant. It takes a gigantic dinosaur-sized poo on mainstream action films which people seem to love like, Fast Five. If The Raid 3 is any improvement on this, then it will end up being the greatest action film ever. Perhaps if Evans is given a gigantic budget, he could pull off a conclusion as epic as The Dark Knight Rises. We live in hope.",

The choreography is amazing and the audience feels every single brutal hit. The acting from all parts is amazing with Iko Uwais and Arifin Putra giving standout performances. The directing and cinematography are equally incredible both giving the characters and the fights life. The script is great providing plenty of twists and giving the characters and the world depth. THE BAD: Nothing really, maybe a bit more character development for some of the minor characters? (I'm REALLY nitpicking at this point)THE SUMMARY: I was utterly blown away by this masterpiece. I'm very happy to see a film that does not care at all about censorship and is willing to receive an R rating for it's gratuitous content. If you are squeamish I would proceed with caution however if you're not, I can't not recommend this film enough.

            "content": "So, this week I finally treated my eyes to the manic and extreme feast that is The Raid 2.For anyone living in a cage the past two years that don't know of the action phenomena that was The Raid. Imagine mixing John Woo with Tony Jaa, Jackie Chan and Sam Peckinpah all whacked out on meth amphetamine . The result was a beautifully choreographed violent masterpiece that sets a new level for on screen violence. Now films come and go that try to raise the bar with violence, but violence for violence sake can be too much, so The Raid's helmer Gareth Evans manages to keep the balance perfect without tipping over into overkill.So where does this leave us with his much anticipated sequel? Having The Raid's story contained to a tower block overrun by criminals, Evans continues his story, but expands it to the city and by having his lead infiltrate the criminal underworld. Like Takeshi Kitano's classic gangster movies, Raid 2 examines this underworld by planting the star in the middle, tasked with exposing corrupt officials. Now at 150 minutes long, Evans doesn't rush the story, he allows every criminal faction to have their story played out, but with his flair for quick and direct dialogue, he doesn't leave the viewer nodding off. For every scene of dialogue is simply a way of setting up action pieces, and boy does the The Raid 2 deliver on them. Without revealing any plot and storyline, I can honestly say that while The Raid was extreme, The Raid 2 is extreme and incredibly bloody. Where the first movie had its main henchman Mad Dog, a vicious killer who was involved in one of the best 2 on 1 fight scenes I have ever seen, The Raid 2 has 2 hit men simply name Baseball Bat Man and Hammer Girl. These two have the most memorable scenes in the film. Hammer Girls subway attack with dual claw hammers is wince inducing and ferociously violent, a classic in the making. So, this leaves us with our star, Iko Uwais as Rama is back, and with more skills under his belt to unleash the carnage on those in his path. When Iko fights, his arms are a blur, this guy make Bruce Lee appear sluggish in comparison. He wreaks havoc across the city, slowly chipping away at the underworld in some of the most breathtaking action sequences I have ever seen. Car chase, gun fights and hand to hand combat leave the viewer engrossed. I actually gasped for breath after the car chase scene, it was riveting and a classic in the making. Also the kitchen fight which lasted about 10 minutes and ended up with the white of the tiled room being painted blood red by the end in one of the bloodiest fights I have ever witnessed. So was I impressed, you might just say I was, and then some. The film flew by quickly, not a moment dragged and the pace was perfect. And while Gareth Evans takes a break between this and the third film, I can thank him and use this period to get my breath back. 10/10",

I cannot fathom how much dedication it takes to produce such brilliance. The only thing that annoyed me was that it has to end. Needless to say, i was chomping at the bit to see the sequel. Anticipation was booming and i optimistically pushed back any doubt that it wouldn't live up to the hype.Even if there was doubt it would have been buried after 30 minutes of this film. By the half an hour mark, i knew that it was only going to get better and better and better. And that it did. The characters are gruesomely compelling. The fight scenes are better than the first outing. The detail that goes into everything is unbelievable; each location milked of all its potential violence; squeezing the life out of all creativity that can be taken advantage of. It is perfection in its purest form. I was stoked to see Yayn Ruhain back; albeit as another character, but his skills where so pivotal in the fight scenes from the first film, that it was great to see him back.

That the makers were able to do what they did with the limited budget they had is just astonishing. I don't have enough praise to give to this film.I was actually skeptical about the sequel, wondering if the pace and energy could be maintained in a more open environment. The sequel could be seen as the grown up version of the first film. The filmmakers more than held their own with the bigger scope. Set pieces, camera angles were quite creative and exciting. The car chase scene in particular was very well done.The martial arts in this film is arguably one of the most brutal ever on film. Mr. Evans has a great knack for brutal, in your face action sequences; but also handled the bigger scope of the film very well with good pacing between pure action and entertaining dialogue. I felt that the writers allowed the plot to get away from them at times, but the action scenes with their rich characters more than make up for that minor gripe. After all, I paid a ticket to see some great ass-kicking, not August: Osage County! With an obvious sequel in the wings, I'm more than looking forward to what's next. Gareth Evans and his team are on fire and are showing Hollywood (with its lame, talentless directors/producers) how action movies are done. The Raid: Redemption & The Raid 2: Berandal are two of the greatest action films EVER made. 2 for 2 for Evans, Uwais & Co. I'm quite thankful for their efforts, it's a shame that more people can't appreciate what they're doing.

However, that being said, at a run time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, the action scenes are spread out over longer periods of time verses the first film. The first film was more adrenaline fueled and that is what made it so great. This is a more complex story line and we learn more about characters and have a lot larger cast. Adding a lot more interesting characters! Some do not get enough screen time, which is unfortunate given its long run time.Of course the Action is top notch. It adds some interesting characters with special fighting skills (Hammer Girl & Baseball Guy). The choreography is beautiful to watch, especially with the slow motion camera work. Though sometimes the camera is somewhat shaky. But at 2 hours and 30 minutes, the film drags at times. The film could have used a bit more editing and chopped it down the roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes. Any movie going over 2 hours and 15 minutes risks burning out viewers and losing the gravity of the situation it wants to create. The Raid 2 just barely avoids doing that.As for The director, he does do a phenomenal job. The close ups and slow motion scenes are fantastic adding some great tension to the film. They are shot beautifully. That being said, the cinematography is great. That seems to be a growing trend among foreign films.Overall, the Movie is Great, but ultimately a small let down. The film begins to drag and leaves several unanswered questions, especially the main \"objective\" of the film. I was hoping for a 9/10 or 10/10 film but 8/10 seems to be appropriate. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film very much, but went into it expecting just a little more! \"Best Action Movie Of All Time\"....Sadly NoMore Movie reviews here : www.simplefilmreviews.com",

            "content": "Please tell me this is the most popular movie out right now. Please, it deserves to be. This movie is without a doubt my favorite fighting film since Bruce Lee's and Tony Jaa's work. This is the best action movie in a long time. To understand why this movie is so amazing you really have to be a fan of martial arts or kung fu movies. A movie with a camera positions that's actually zoomed out far enough to see everything. Actors actually punching/kicking each other (not hard obviously) to really make it look legit. Fight choreography, that you can't see being choreographed. I'm so happy right now, I haven't seen a movie this awesome in a while. The undercover cop isn't anything new but the way they made their spin on it is perfect. I know they are Indonesian but I they seem like Yakuza to me with their traditions, honor, fighting instead of guns and pride for their territory.So details (no spoilers don't worry) Raid has always been high paced fast gory action. I enjoyed the Raid Redemption but as far as overall cinematic quality goes it was just gory awesome fighting, without context we won't really care who's fighting who. But Raid 2 provides that context and makes you immersed in it's story and characters. Honestly, I don't mean any offense but I'm surprised this was made by the same people. This movie has amazing shots and they give a great sense of character development by showing us who they are. So Raid 2 not only stands on a high leg from it's amazing action but the cinematic quality is just beautiful. The sad moments really are tragic and the actors display raw emotion which help builds the tension and atmosphere of a scene. And when a character is supposed to be blank, cold and brutal you see that too. Baseball bat boy... oh man he's awesome. The imagery in this film is just perfect. I really don't know what else to say. Yes it's a gory film, over gory? Maybe but it's realistic, if you shoot someone in the face with shotgun they won't have a tiny whole in their head... it will be in pieces everywhere. So I don't see over gory as much as somewhat realistic. Oh it has a lot of gory scenes but I don't think it's over the top.Please go see this movie, it deserves your money. It works hard for your money. It wants you to have a good time. And a good time you will have. Seriously I want to see more movies like this.",

Unlike the first film where it's almost like a video game, this sequel has more of a story with twists and turns throughout. But lets be real, everyone's question should be...how did the action compare to the first one? I will say that at over 2 1/2 hours it might not seem like it has as much action as the first and rightfully so, but when there was action, it was fantastic. The fight choreography was absolutely brilliant and also very gruesome. But really, it comes down to the final fight in a kitchen. And boy, it was probably the best fight I've ever seen put to film. I was blown away and even if you think the whole rest of the movie is boring, that final fight will have you leaving the theater satisfied.I personally enjoyed this one better than the first. I feel it's a different type of action movie and even though it's much longer, it didn't feel long while I was watching it. If you have doubts, drop them and go watch this movie.",

            "content": "Having not seen, or even heard of The Raid up until about 2 weeks prior to the sequel's screening, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from an unknown (to me) Welsh filmmaker directing a foreign action flick. After watching the predecessor, my next course of action was to immediately book tickets for the (apparently) long-awaited second-installment, and when the time finally arrived, Evans delivered once again. The first thing you'll notice is that The Raid 2 is quite a bit longer than the first film, probably because of the limited environment the original was set in. Not that this is at all a negative however; as soon as the film kicks into action with a jaw-dropping opening scene, time becomes a mere fantasy as you become lost in Evans' dazzling world of violence, gore and snippets of dark humor. As mentioned previously, the environment in which the new (and a few of the old) characters find themselves in is a lot more varied. This is one of the movie's main strengths, showcasing more areas for character interaction and more importantly for them to beat the hell out of one another, the ever-changing back-drop is the primary asset that maintains interest and keeps the picture afloat for what may originally seem an exhausting 150 minutes.And then there's the action sequences. Well. Just when you thought the violence couldn't get any more horrific, fast-paced or simply all-round spectacular, Evans brings in a host of new faces to raise the bar yet again. The wider range of characters and deeper plot provide an opportunity for a fairly intriguing story line to emerge, dispersing the action sequences between the moments of dialogue. If there had to be a criticism, then it may be that some of the 'talking' scenes seem a bit too prolonged at times. However upon reflection these really did contribute to the unfolding plot, and when the ever-more epic action did arrive, the build-up made it seem even more monumental (if that's possible to imagine!)All in all The Raid 2 presents a big step up from the first film - and trust me, that's saying something. No spoilers here, but when Rama says \"watch over me\" about 25 minutes before the conclusion is reached, fasten your seat belts - cos something's about to hit the fan!",

It was just a collection of action junkies laughing, groaning, treating phantom pain and just having a killer time watching the spectacle kick, punch and smash stuff across the screen.I will fully admit that there were points in the story where I felt it was handled a little bit haphazardly as it couldn't quite juggle all the activity going on in it and, like the last film, the movie does take some time to really catch its rhythm but, once it does, the film is just incredible. The action is more than satisfying and the fight scenes are choreographic epically\u0085not terrifically or fantastically. No, the fight scenes are put together in such a fast pace, jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring manner that they just aren't good and they are well beyond great.\"The Raid: Redemption\" felt like the high an action junkie looks for but was crafted from an action drug that was forged from a dying star while heavy metal blasted in the background and \"The Raid 2\" feels like another round at that feeling. While not as satisfying as the first one for me, the film was still all kinds of awesome and another example of the fact that Hollywood still has a lot to learn in the genre.Greetings!

So, \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" put a patch on this and now we have a production where everything is on point. The story is captivating and really tense, action sequences are improved, and there are tons of new locations, which also unlocked new possibilities for the director. Characters are deepened and the plot thickens with interesting details. For sure a very beautiful way to end Rama story and honestly I am happy that they stopped at the second movie, because I am pretty sure that there is nothing more to be told. Gareth Evan proved once again to be a great director and honestly I was stunned by this upgrade. The camera angles, the photography and the transitions between scenes are very creative and unusual, they used better equipment and better lighting.

Of course the plot should make sense, but we're really only watching this for one reason. That of course is the fighting, which is obviously incredible.Then there are the guns... either they were conveniently available or they weren't. There didn't ever seem to be any rhyme or reason as to who would have a gun and when.

This is a sequel, in case you were curious about the 2 in the title and there is a third Raid in the works. This is a martial arts extravaganza that, just like the first one, spotlights the Indonesian martial art of Silat. It starts off about 2 hours after the first one ended. Iko, the surviving cop, is recruited to go undercover and bust up a crime ring. Tio is one of the gang bosses Iko is after. Arifin is Tio's son and Julie is a hired muscle that goes by the name of Hammer Girl-in case you were wondering, she does not do carpenter work. She has a brother that is called Baseball Bat Man, and I'm sure that you can guess what his favorite weapon might be. There are lots of fight scenes; one in a bathroom stall involving about 50 guys-I'm not kidding, one on a subway train with Julie and her twin hammers, one that takes place inside one of the cars involved in a high speed car chase and one in a kitchen that is almost like a ballet. Oh yeah, Iko is the fight choreographer and some of the fights are unbelievable-I don't see how some of the actors/stunt men were not really hurt during some of the fights. It is brutally violent. The only complaint I could think of is that it is sub- titled-you have to read it-but that is a minor quibble. If you liked the first one, this one is better. It's rated \"R\" for the bloody, brutal violence, sexuality-including nudity-and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 30 minutes. I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",

Since the latter scene is just a preliminary bout in THE RAID 2, I'd have to choose this well-done sequel. The visuals in THE RAID 2 are mesmerizing, the plotting classical (think ROMEO & JULIET crossed with MACBETH, and a pinch of OTHELLO, minus any romantic clutter), and the fighting superb. You could also say THE RAID 2 is a cross between HAMLET (everyone dies in the end) and GONE WITH THE WIND (the Old Guard and its courtly ways are wiped out forever). This film is 150 minutes of non-stop action, with a deftly-done car chase and a surprising passage in English thrown in for good measure. Though the first RAID movie seems to have featured an actual police raid on a mob kingpin's stronghold, its sequel simplifies the police attack to a one-man wrecking crew named \"Rama.\" This \"hero\" is simply a young cop coerced into following orders. Of his 91 killings shown here, the most drawn out and painfully burned victim turns out to be another young cop coerced into following orders. Rama's final would-be savior (the mobster Eka) turns out to be another formerly young cop coerced into following orders. THE RAID 2's obvious lesson: if you're a young Asian cop, do NOT follow orders!",

            "content": "With having been disappointed for the last year or so that I did not got the chance to see a highly praised,gritty Action film from Indonesia called The Raid on the big screen thanks to it not being shown at any near by cinema.A few days ago,I was caught completely by surprise,when a fellow IMDb'er told me that The Raid 2 was going to reach the UK in a few days time.Searching round for showings of the movie,I was delighted to find that it was being screened 10 miles away,which lead to me getting ready to make a trip,so that I could finally join in the raid.The plot:Meeting up with an undercover cop called Bunawar after his brother Andi has been killed by a rising gangster called Bejo,and also having been involved in a failed raid of a major gangster's den,police officer Rama is offered the chance to work with Bunawar in a splinter group designed to uncover police corruption.Fearing that the gangsters behind Andi's death could next go after his wife,Rama accepts the offer.Being ordered by Bunawar to infiltrate 2 gangs called the Bangun's and the Goto's,who run the city's underworld. Rama decides to get hold of the Bangun's getting into a fight with the leading Bangun's only son,Uco,which leads to Uco and Rama both being chucked in jail,with Rama being given 2 years.2 Years later:Smartly spending his time in jail building a trust with Uco by showing that he can stand his ground against any of the prison gangs,Rama (working under an alias) is given the golden ticket,by being hired as a body guard for Uco and his dad.Attempting to stick to his plan his capturing the gangs using corrupt officers,Rama begins to notice to his horror that Uco is making power-grabs on his 'old man's' stomping ground,which will lead to this murderous underworld rising up to the suffice.View on the film:Keeping away from the limitations of the first Raid's one tower block location, (although a multi-storey building does feature) writer/director Gareth Evans unleashes his dream project with a tremendous stylised vision.For the movies eye catching appearance,Evans uses cold stainless steel colours and tough tracking shots to soak the movie in a tense Neo-Noir atmosphere and to also reveal the countless miles that the gangster's will battle their way across,in order to keep control of their ground. Along with the Neo-Noir atmosphere,Evans also shows a fantastic,uncompromising eye to the titles breath taking action scenes.Along with giving the film a touch of Comic Book thanks to the appearance of the perfectly named character 'Hammer Girl', (played by an alluring Julie Estelle)Evans splatters spilling blood right across the screen,with Evans delicately balancing good use of close ups with sharply angled shots,which allow the viewer to see every nose breaking move that the cast, (who performed all of the stunts themselves,with no wires or any CGI stand ins) deliver.Matching his tough as nails directing,the screenplay by Evans unleashes his murderous underworld with a deadly intensity,as Evans makes sure that each of the fight scenes is connected to the falling of the old underworld that Rama finds himself in the middle of.Along with giving the fight scenes a firm context,Evans also gives this gangster epic a very poetic feel,thanks to Evans gradually allowing for the rift between Uco and his dad to become exposed,until it is fully torn by the psychotic face that Uco has been keeping hidden under his mask.Taking on anyone that stands in his way,Iko Uwais gives an excellent performance as Rama,with Uwais giving the character a real heart and soul which Uwais shows Rama finding increasing tough to grasp,as he starts to head deeper into the city's underworld.Playing Rama's 'other side of the coin' Arifin Putra gives an extraordinarily creepy performance as Uco,with Putra showing Uco growing anger towards his dad, (played by a superb Tio Pakusadewo)which lead's to Uco losing all sense of loyalty,as he begins to plan his own raid on his dad's underworld legacy.",

            "content": "I first heard about Raid when Stallone tweeted that it was the best action film out right then and to think it's an Indonesian film that cost 1 million dollars. Anyway the guy knew what he was talking about \u2013 it was even rumored that Stallone would be asking the director Gareth Evans to helm Expendable 3. Anyway so the film after a short introduction phase turned into the last 20 minutes of John Rambo except it was an hour long. It was genius. Bloody, raw, gritty and violent. The only big problem with the film was the script and the total lack of a story. It probably didn't reform the action genre but it did give us something new compared to the other films that came out around that time. Not long after we were delivered the news that there will be a sequel, in which they promised that there would be a story and it will be more layered and complicated oh and the director would be the same. So let's talk about what happened. First up the story: Rama after surviving the trials of the first move finds himself in a painfully real predicament, he still needs to get away from the guys he messed up. The only escape route is going undercover but for that he has to go to jail first so he can get on the good side of the family running the underworld so he can bring down a couple of corrupt cops. There are problems with the plan and after the cruel years in prison Rama \u2013 who's been pulled away from his family \u2013 finds himself in the middle of a war between to underworld families that a mysterious third party instigates. The slow style that we associate with Asian cop films doesn't make the 150 minute boring. The first part seemed to have too much action while the sequel seems to go about it smarter but in the end you basically end up with the same result. The second part is definitely a step forward story, camera, music and drama wise. The new genre that the first one was said to create really comes to life in the sequel. Now it really became true that it's been a long time since there has been an action movie like this, maybe even never. Its nice to see the promotion of a film tell the truth. Its better and richer than the first one. It's a two and a half hour action-opera that will be appealing to anyone who likes action films. It's not hard to give the film a rating, it was easy the first time around too. I give it a 10 out of 10. It reformed a genre and takes it into a new direction that we have been waiting for for about 25 years. It's been a long time since I've seen a 10 but this definitely deserves it. https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1",

The movie is a relentless and adrenaline fueled action movie, that has countless amazing scenes that it's hard to pick just one as your favorite. These guys have proved once again that they produce some of the best martial arts action ever! It's more than just a martial arts movie, it is an epic. Combining action and drama very nicely. The plot is a lot more complex than the first. This one requires a little more attention to the details and is on a whole other level in terms of a movie in this genre as a whole.

It begins straight after the events of the first film and the next chapter has Rama undercover in a prison to gain information on a Kingpin to take him down inside the organization. It's not a very original story but it works and continues to be interesting, just something that never gets old. I didn't really think the characters would be so good, seriously great written. Of course Rama being the favorite but Uco is a close second. The larger length of the movie made it so there could be a much more deeper story and drama, fantastic drama.The fight choreography, just that alone makes this movie re-watchable, it's beyond amazing. How all the hand-to-hand combat was real says something how awesome this movie is, the actors and stunt performers really did some great work and should get praise for it as it is incredible. It's a very talented crew of filmmakers, the cinematography and camera work are one of many highlights. Just visually pleasing. Gareth Evans is once again the writer, director and producer and he Ups his game. The musical score is something worth mentioning, it's perfect and flows well with the fight scenes. It's better than the previous film's. The editing, just wow.There are many memorable and brilliant fight sequences, varying from small to large. Here's some that I liked the most.\n* Prison Yard Fight: it was almost too brutal but how it was shot was beautiful in a sense and then the killing began and it continued to be shot so beautiful with it looking if not it being a one take. The set was amazing and how every little detail matter like the fence and mud. Pure perfection. Memorable.\n* Vehicle Fight: From a technical standpoint I have no idea how they pulled it off, can't have been on a real road but it looks like it. Inside a 4 seated car, has to be impossible to choreograph but guess what they did and that whole sequence is another reason to re-watch this movie.\n* Hallway and Kitchen Fight: Iko Uwais is the star of this franchise and it shows in these two scenes, he kicks serious ass and the martial arts he's using is so satisfying to watch. The hallway fight after the warehouse has Rama against Hammer Girl and Baseball Guy, that's so comic booky but it works as it's entertaining. It was amazing, seeing him taking on then alone as he worked together with his brother in the previous movie to take on an overpowered foe. Directly after comes one of the best yet, the kitchen fight. It's a love letter to martial art movies, in a way in looking at the start of it then it grows into a 1v1 brutal fight. It's truly a fascinating and entertaining fight, re-watchable and its possibly one of the best fight scenes I have seen.",

Obviously that made me quite excited and hyped to watch this sequel. I can gladly say that this film did not let me down. It really improves on the first film a lot. Although, this sequel is quite different than the first one. This one is 2 hours and 30 minutes, and contains a lot more dialogue and plot. I have a feeling some may not like this because of the wild and crazy pacing of the first film, but I can say that it's well done and I enjoyed it. After watching it, the first film that came to my mind was \"Outrage\" and it's sequel \"Outrage Beyond\". Those are both films dealing with gang conflict and contain scenes of extremely violent but extremely awesome kills. That is a lot like The Raid 2. It establishes a story, gives you some amazing characters with great performances, every now and then giving you a taste of some of that amazing action, until the last 30 minutes or so where the action really steps up and starts to kick some serious ass. There is a final fight that I think is one of the best fights in any action film. Period. The director also really improved on the visual style. The first film had a constant blue tint and felt washed out. This time, the movie had a much cleaner look, and at times reminded me of \"Only God Forgives\" with it's interesting neon look. It even includes some great close ups on certain objects that increase the tension just before a fight. The director really stepped his game up and made a much better film then the first. This is a film that can be said to have a great story (although slightly clich\u00e9d at times) AND incredible action sequences.

Also added larger scale in storyline which hadn't found in \"The Raid: Redemption\" makes it more interesting to follow.Unfortunately, the movie isn't without it's fault. It suffers with overlong duration and some minor mistakes. Probably it's fun to see bloody violence and killing scenes but would feel too much when exploited almost non-stop in 2 and a half hour length. Despite some weaknesses, \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" is incredible in martial arts aspect and the last 30 minutes of the movie is an epic tense. Can't wait what surprises Gareth Evans could offer at \"The Raid 3\".",

It has a lot of style, a lot of enthusiasm, and I'm sure many found it completely riveting. It just didn't do anything to help me form an emotional connection to anything happening on screen. When action is nicely built and minimally used, I can find it effective (Drive) but if it happens every 10 minutes or so, some other fight, and I don't give a damn about these characters, why should I care? It's a shame because like I said, from a technical level it's hugely impressive. But it was honestly just not a good time at all. I don't hate it because it doesn't do anything that's offensive or beyond stupid or anything, but I didn't like it. It did, however, have quite a bit of clunky, laughable dialogue (which I'm sure some people will tell me is the point and the intention) but it just got me more annoyed, honestly. Not in a good mood at all.",

The sequel picks up right where the first film left off in the storyline, which gives a nice sense of continuity.Everything I liked about the first film returned and evolved in the second film. The action scenes are far more creative and diverse - you won't see the same thing twice throughout. As a forewarning to the squeamish, there's far more brutality than in The Raid 1: There were definitely a few scenes that had everyone in the theater cringing and uttering exclamations. For myself only one scene involving a shotgun was excessively violent, the rest made the action aspect of the film very visceral.The one thing the sequel far surpasses its predecessor in is the plot. The story is very intriguing, giving many of the roles much more character than you'll usually find in a martial arts movie. I even found myself empathizing with some of the villains after learning their background. In addition the very clever editing/cinematography seamlessly connect one scene to the next using some gorgeous visuals along the way. To sum up, it's a must-see for anyone who enjoyed The Raid 1. If you can stomach the violence you're in for a hell of a ride and I'm very much looking forward to The Raid 3 for which the stage has been set.",

            "content": "The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) is a hard-core action martial arts-flick and one of the best sequel I have ever seen! I love this movie to death! The Raid: Redemption and The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) are two different films on their both own way. The Raid 2 does not copy The Raid 1 and they are both unique on their own way. The Raid: Redemption is a police action martial arts thriller, that more focus on a police S.W.A.T. team trapped in a tenement building run by a ruthless drug dealer and his army of killers and thugs. The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) is a gangster martial arts action thriller that focus more on Indonesian crime syndicate that is feuding with an invasive Japanese Yakuza clan including corrupt cops in Jakarta that are working for the mob and a cop goes undercover to stop them. The sequel to me is far more superior and improvement over the original, it focus more on a story telling and delivers a lot of blood violence, action and gore tons slashers and blood. I love this film to death I love it! I love that movie followers right after the events that in the first movie ended.I love the scenes in the movie: Mad Dog ( Yayan Ruhian) from the first film played a different character in Raid 2 as Prakoso, who is the hit-man for Uco father ( the Indonesian Crime family guy), in the movie Prakoso was set up, I think, Uco lied, when he said he want to go out to take a leak, he actually deliberately left Prakoso alone so that Bejo's guys can come and kill him, Uco's intention was trying to make a war with the Goto family ( Japanese crime family) by sacrificing Prakoso, because Prakoso is his father's hit-man and is very close to him. Its a bit hard to tell which guys are working for Gotos or Bejos because they look similar, I think the Goto's family also hired some local Indonesians guys as their thugs....we will probably see more of Goto's family in action in the third installment. I love the most astonish masterpiece action fight scenes between Rama against Baseball Bat Man and Hammer Girl. Those scenes were brilliant and genius. The choreographer in this film was just outstanding, The acting in this film is real convincing and realistic. The acting Drama is believable, Rama was always wounded and you can see that, he is not a superman or some action hero like Steven Seagal with no bruises on it, Rama is a human been like you and me. I love that Rama gets screwed up by the people he was working for, he goes to prison, he was told he will seat for a only few months and he cuts for 2. years later. I mean gosh he sits in a hell hole for 2.years not few months, every scene is a twist in here. Like this guy murders his own father and viewers fearing what he will become when he kills his own father. Gosh that was so intense and astonish. That girl Alicia 'Hammer Girl' played by Julie Estelle as an Bejo assassin was a scary fantastic genius character, Julie Estelle played perfectly the character. That guy Baseball Bat Man played by Very Tri Yulisman was outstanding in his role playing the second assassin they were both awesome assassins in this movie. The bottom of line that I love this movie Rama goes in the warehouse and single handily defeats all the mobsters, he did not had any help in this movie. That is why this movie is a perfect 10, this is what it should have been in the first movie Rama (Iko Uwais) beats and kills with his barely fists everyone including those three assassins. Cecep Arif Rahman as the Japanese assassin was also awesome, he was great as the third Bejo assassin henchman.Everything is bigger and more expensive, the look is on the action it delivers the story and delivers the action! It is the best adrenaline-fulled action ride and an Action masterpiece! It is the reason that movies are made it is unique, it is the reason that Action movies are made!!! It is one of the bets action movies, you got to watch it! It is 2 Hr. and 30. min and is not that long, the effects are great, the music is great. Everything is great! This movie has great character in sense, sometimes it is not development, there is more arc, more development in this movie and I like that you aren't sure what, they are going to do with characters, movies are predictable. Every action scene was intense and different, always different setting always different view always different feel to the character been in a different world with each fight scene.I thought it is going to be a simple revenge movie based on the opening and it wasn't that at all. What I really appreciate in this action film it is so stylish it is, yes, It feels realistic at some times, this film is more bloodier than the first movie. This movie kicks ass and I am giving a 10/10 for been the best action movie sequel of all time! The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) is Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and The Godfather Part II (1974). Movies like this should be made in Hollywood.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Sony Pictures Classics Stage 6 Films Starring: Iko Uwais, Arifin Putra, Oka Antara, Tio Pakusadewo, Alex Abbad, Julie Estelle, Ryuhei Matsuda, Kenichi Endo, Kazuki Kitamura Director: Gareth Evans Producers: Ario Sagantoro, Nate Bolotin, Aram Tertzakian Writer: Gareth Evans Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hr. 30 Mins.

And the wait for this movie was quite long, especially given the fact that you knew it was on the way. And now, finally gotten to see it, I must say that \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" does deliver. It wasn't as impressive as the first movie, but with that I am not saying that it is bad, quite far the opposite actually.The storyline here is a bit more deep compared to the first movie, but it is the storyline that sort of tones the movie down a notch compared to the first movie. While director Gareth Evans do try hard, there are just too many loose ends and things throughout the storyline that just makes you sit there and wonder why it was put in the movie. A lot of scenes were just too random, and it gave the movie a little bit too much of a not fully completed feel to it.The action sequences were impressive, though, just as they were in the first movie. Lots of adrenaline-filled action sequences throughout the entire movie. And they were nicely filmed and executed, which just added to the enjoyment.What really stands out in the movie is, of course, the martial arts and fighting sequences. Just as in the first movie, these are off the charts. Lots of really nicely choreographed fighting here as well, and the fighting is realistic and seems quite physical, unlike many Chinese martial arts movies where it is way too choreographed to the point of almost being a dance show. I love the way that you see, hear and almost feel the punches and kicks impact during the fight scenes. And the way that the scenes are filmed with the dynamic camera right in the midst of the action is just mind-blowingly great.\"The Raid 2: Berandal\" does take the violence from the new movie to a whole new levels. There were more visually brutal scenes and inventive ways to add violence to the movie. I mean, the guy with the baseball bat and baseballs, and the lady with the shades and the two hammers. That was just a stroke of violent genius. It was a shame, though, that the hammer girl wasn't more in the movie, because the scene in the subway train was just impressive.This is, as the first movie was, a pure adrenaline- and testosterone-driven movie. The martial arts and violence are the core essentials of the movie, and once again the Indonesians put their mark on the martial arts action movie scene. And Iko Uwais still do impress and deliver the goods, proving that the age of \"wire-fu\" has passed, standing right up alongside Tony Jaa.",

He is invited to join the unit and go undercover in one of the main criminal gangs. To that end he is given a new identity and sent to prison. Here he gains the trust of Uco, the son of mafia boss Bangun. Once out of prison he soon becomes a trusted member of Bangun's organisation. Uco turns out to be a problem; he believes that his father should promote him and when he doesn't, he engineers a war with local Japanese gangsters. This ends a ten year truce and puts Rama in a very dangerous position.The original Raid film was almost nonstop action with a very basic plot; this has plenty of action but it also has a much deeper plot. There are multiple groups of characters; as well as Rama there is Bangun's gang, the Japanese and another up-and-coming gang leader who is quite keen to help Uco start a war that could eliminate his rivals. The action might not be non-stop this time but there is still plenty of it and this time it is more varied. There are lots of fights, including one that takes place in the back of a car during a car chase! The characters are interesting; Rama continues to be the good cop and the various mobsters are suitably dangerous. We also have some great minor characters; most notably 'Hammer Girl' And 'Baseball Boy' a pair of assassins whose methods match their nicknames; Hammer Girl is particularly impressive as she brutally deals with a group of knife-wielding thugs on a train using a pair of claw hammer! The cast does an impressive job making the story interesting and the action believable\u0085 at least within the context of an action movie. Our hero is not the sort lead that never gets hurt, far from it, he is left bloody and battered after all his fights. Overall I'd recommend this to any fans of the genre\u0085 it is pretty brutal but I expect anybody watching this will be expecting that.",

Tried to get the invitation to the premiere but I can't get any.First off, the action sequence is amazingly improved upon the first film. There's much variety of it, including car chase scenes, gun wars, and also the fight scenes. The scenes pace is very, very fast, like the first film. I was thrilled and finally ended up gasping every time the action scene ends.Next, the story. I could say that the first film's story is a bit too simplistic (the director said that the first film is \"an exercise\" before he did this). The Raid 2, well, is giving us a much larger story. It's the \"your regular gang wars\" story. Maybe with a bit twist. But it is a huge improvement over the first film.The characters in the film itself has their own background. They could even make a lot of spin off based of its characters. What interests me is the Baseball Bat Guy and Hammergirl's background.Overall, this is a must watch. Maybe there's a bit of letdown with the pace at the beginning of the film. But it all pays off with all the action scenes.And Gareth, I'll wait for the third film!",

            "content": "The Raid : Redemption was an amazing movie, can't wait this second sequel. Gareth Huw Evans's The Raid, released in 2012 but already a modern action classic, was a bloody masterpiece of claustrophobic narrative economy. Its simple, video-game-like conceit was that of a Jakarta cop stuck in a giant drug den apartment complex, being attacked by wave after wave of junkies and henchmen as he made his way to the main villains. The Raid 2 opens almost precisely where the first one left off, but then quickly does away with the typical sequel idea of staging the same film in a different environment; it abruptly, almost hilariously broadens its scope. If The Raid took place over a couple of hours, The Raid 2 takes place over years. If The Raid was mostly one guy fighting a bunch of other guys, The Raid 2 is many guys (and one exceptional gal) fighting each other in various head-spinning combinations. If The Raid was a tight, tough, flawlessly executed action flick, The Raid 2, while almost equally amazing, is a diffuse, ambitious, flawed gangster ballet. It's so sprawling that it feels like it could be a series. Maybe it should have been. But the big screen is clearly where such explosive cinema belongs. Source : http://www.vulture.com",

Conspiracy theories out the window!This movie is a masterpiece of martial arts cinema and is easily the best thing to be released from Asia in the past 15 years.Being a fan of the previously released Raid film, specifically due to its relentless overload of close quarters action, I was a little sceptical about the second film's plot expansion and how it would all work.My worries where in no way realised as this movie combines the abundance of action found in the first film with a well written and executed storyline that is both deep and easy to understand.Performances from the cast are all round excellent, everyone plays their part and does so with a sense of menace similar to that of old age Asian cinema.The way the film is shot is at times breathtaking, setting the scene with some fantastic panning shots of pivotal areas and the use of lighting brings these shots to life in beautiful detail. From a snow ridden back alley to a dark and seedy nightclub, everything is realised in such detail that it is hard to ignore what a great job the DOPs have done!The score is tremendous, building and crashing as the action on screen flows or complementing subtlety a plot developing scene in a restaurant or an office.Gareth Evans has far exceeded my expectations with this movie and originally I was again sceptical upon reading, prior to seeing this movie, that The Raid 3 would be set 3 hours prior to the conclusion of The Raid 2.. Essentially taking place during the second film.Now I simply can't wait to see how it all ends.A true masterpiece of Asian cinema, a must see for anyone who is at all interested in Asian cinema, martial arts or action films.",

This is the first time The Raid 2 screened in Indonesia.At beginning, the movie is a little bit slow and you might get confused if you haven't watched the first movie. But, when the fighting begins you wouldn't have the time to leave your seat. After every fighting scene, many audiences clap their hands with satisfaction in the theater. Every fighting scene in this movie is an ART. The prison fight, the train fight, the car chase, and the kitchen fight are all great and memorable. Thus, this movie should become a reference for any action movie in the future. I think this is the movie with the best fighting scenes, ever.If the first movie is a great action movie, then the sequel has a more complicated story and deeper character development. There are also some emotional moments from the main character. Especially, I think Arifin Putra's acting were quite good, he deserves nomination for best supporting actor.

            "content": "Following on straight after the events of the first movie we are back alongside Rama as he is once again lured into another mission, or should that be used in another mission. The last three members to survive the tower block raid are seen here together again, albeit briefly, as Rama is now wanted for an undercover job. Expect betrayal, blood, broken bones and a whole load of very similar looking characters.Right away this is the problem with this sequel, the plot, its meh. The whole reason why the first movie was so explosive was the excellent story. A special team of elite cops enter a tower block in the slums of Jakarta to bring down a crime lord. They start at the bottom and must work their way up floor by floor taking out scum, the whole premise was solid, tight, tense and claustrophobic, the perfect storm. This sequel sees Rama going undercover to expose a corrupt police official (Reza) who is tied in with criminal gangs, this means getting friendly with a crime bosses son (Uco) in jail and working for the enemy (Uco's father Bangun). Things get complicated when another crime Boss Bejo, obviously wanting power and control, teams up with Bangun's son to try and start a war against a rival Japanese crime syndicate, this act being against Bangun's will. The only reason for this mainly being Uco wants to show his father how strong and dependable he his, to prove himself. The other reason being Bejo thinks the Japanese are trying to sway Reza against the Bangun syndicate. Jesus I had to think about that just writing it! and this is the problem, the plot is really convoluted in my opinion with characters coming out of the woodwork. I've not even mentioned the betrayal twists involving gangs killing their own and then faking reprisals to kick start this war, not to mention corrupt police gangs and undercover cop twists on top!I genuinely had some trouble following what was going on from scene to scene, so many characters all kinda looking the same whilst scenes popped up outta nowhere with little reasoning (Prakoso the assassin I'm looking at you). Its only later on down the line I realised what that previous scene had been about and why, I had to rewatch scenes and read up on sections. It is good that the continuity is there from the start, they had the same two actors from the last movie briefly and it all smoothly crosses into this story which was cool. Alas at no point did I ever really feel the same adrenaline shot that I did for the first film, this could of been any action movie, its a generic plot that's been done before many times and I was actually bored periodically.Of course the movie is all about the fights, this is the movies forte, its reason for being. Does that disappoint? errr...kinda, in all honesty it did in places yes, let me explain. There didn't actually seem to be as many fights in this film, probably because its not set in a confined space, what there was became so outrageous and so long I again found myself getting bored. Yes the first movie had awesome fights that were ridiculous and long but this movie does seem to go that little bit further. You still have tonnes of faceless henchmen getting their asses handed to them on a plate which is standard procedure and fun. But the boss fights almost become a parody and just go on and on and on, the main fight towards the end in the kitchen especially. I realise that's because both characters are highly trained fighters in their art but you get dizzy watching this sh*t, the director just doesn't know when to stop, less is more guy! The blood and violence is sky high I might add it really is, non- stop bloodbath of epic proportions. Yet again I have to say its too much, less is more, there comes a point when the blood and gore is so extravagant that it loses all impetus, it becomes dull and non- engaging. I really found myself yearning for some good old fashioned fisticuffs that didn't involve various weapons that naturally result in gallons of claret everywhere, and I really disliked the assassins with their specific weapons. Seriously Evans are you trying to be the Asian Robert Rodriguez here? well don't, it ain't a good move. Don't any criminal gangs use guns in this world? would be easier.We all know what this movie offers, you know what to expect and it certainly delivers on that. I can't complain about the violence because the movie is all about pure violence...and a traditional practice involving mental, physical and spiritual development but anyway. My main issue is the fact it just feels like a run of the mill action fest that offers nothing new (accept another look at a newish martial art). The first movie worked really well because of the cracking story, setting and close quarters action, this has none of that, its just a gangster flick with lots of stereotypical stuff in it. Hell even the car chase looked crap, you can clearly see the cars are going quite slow with high speed sound effects dubbed on top. Yes it looks good, yes the fights are impressive when not drenched in blood and yes its a solid achievement for an Indonesian production...but it lacks the quality of its predecessor and just left me numb and weary.5/10",

While the first \"Raid\" was awesome, it didn't exactly have the best story in the world. This one, however, certainly doesn't lack for story. It's like \"The Departed\" meets \"The Godfather\". It's not on the same story level, but it really immerses you in the world. You actually become attached to characters and certain actions in the film will really affect you. However, the real reason this movie gets a 10 from me: the action. Oh. My. Word. I thought the first one was incredible. This one adds even more style and brutality in the best way possible. The action isn't non- stop, as it is paced out between story building scenes. But that doesn't diminish it. From the prison fight to the mud brawl to the very end, it is just freakin sweet. The end to this movie is epic and insane. Some of the scenes actually made my jaw drop. All in all, this isn't a movie for everyone. If you're not an action fan, you'll have a hard time liking this one. It is also probably the bloodiest movie I've ever seen, so if blood makes you queasy, stay away.

            "content": "It was an inauspicious start for The Raid 2: Berandal. Two weeks ago the planned Cineworld screening proceeded perfectly, but for the omission of subtitles, and concluded minutes later with the complete crash of the film. Still, despite yet another own goal from Cineworld, it did prompt the following gem from one of the knuckle draggers who'd made it past security: \"Oh, it's froze. 'E ain't talking Chinese no more\u0085\" And so, take two for Gareth Evans' sequel to his unexpected and breathtaking Indonesian martial arts phenomenon, The Raid: Resurrection.It has been said many times that for a sequel to be regarded as good as the original, it needs to be far better. The Raid 2 doesn't manage that. Not quite. Perhaps the novelty has worn off, maybe the impact has been reduced second time around. Whatever the reason, it doesn't quite hit the same highs. With more focus on plot (and that's a good thing!) the pace has been slowed and at times it trudges and feels a little protracted, whereas the original burst in with a scenario and immediately got down and dirty.Picking up hours after The Raid: Resurrection culminated, rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais) is 'encouraged' by a superior to go undercover to infiltrate one of the gangster families that own the city, to rout out the corrupt cops and politicians and end the gang warfare. In order to gain the trust of Uco (Arifin Putra), son of kingpin Bangun (Tio Pakusodewo), Rama commits a (relatively) minor act of extreme violence to wind up in prison. And then the fighting really begins.Though slower in pace as a whole, the demonstrations of silat (a collective term for the indigenous Asian martial arts) are still remarkable and Evan's camera just cannot keep up. Frequently the images are a blur and, like watching Shakespeare, one has to give up on trying to understand the minutiae and be content with absorbing the broader picture. Despite the limitations (or rather the extreme skill of Uwais et al), the camera-work is stunning whether setting the scene with a tiny corner of activity on a vast screen of static beauty, or packing every square millimetre of the frame with frenetic colour and movement.The choreography is again exemplary and we are treated to an excessive display of movement and gore. To steal my own line from my review of The Raid, this is again exquisite, bloody ballet! The violence is relentless; fight after fight, the ferocity flooding over us in waves. The weaponry is more varied, the mutilations more imaginative; one particularly brutal hammer attack on the tube will have you wide-eyed in awe and sucking air through your teeth in horror at the bloodletting. And watching baseball is never going to be the same again.You need to have seen the first outing to appreciate The Raid 2: Berandal. Beside the obvious need to know the story up to this point, you'll need to be prepared for the extreme brutality and the swift delivery of the gory viciousness.No, The Raid 2: Berandal doesn't quite have the 'wow factor' of the original, but it is still a powerful film that is beautifully shot, fantastically edited and wince inducingly brilliant. It leaves nothing to the imagination and I was worn out by the end.Bring on episode three.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",

This movie picks up almost immediately after the events of the first one with super cop Rama going undercover and infiltrating the biggest gang in Jakarta, in order to expose police corruption and protect his family. While the film is not as fun or as fast paced as the original it is (in many ways) a more grand and epic martial arts masterpiece. The story picks up shortly after the end of the first movie with rookie cop Rama (Uwais) meeting with Jakarta police chief Bunawar (Cok Simbara), who's in charge of an anti-corruption task force. Bunawar informs Rama that his brother, Andi (Donny Alamsyah), was murdered by a gangster named Bejo (Alex Abbad). He asks Rama to join his task force and tells him it's the only way he can protect his wife and child from danger. Rama reluctantly agrees and gets himself thrown into prison with a crime lord's son, named Uco (Arifin Putra). There he earns Uco's trust (by saving his life during a prison riot) and is accepted into Uco's gang (upon his release). From inside the gang he works to expose the masterminds behind Jakarta's dangerous criminal underworld (including dirty cops). Evans originally wanted to make this movie before 'THE RAID: REDEMPTION' but realized it would cost too much money to produce so he decided on a simpler and smaller budgeted film instead ('REDEMPTION'). Due to that movie's success he was able to secure the funds to make this one and came up with the idea of linking the two film's stories (by making this a sequel to the other). I like how wildly different the two movies are. This is a much bigger and broader themed film than the original; it's slower paced, longer and more drawn out but if you like character studies and complex stories it's worth the viewer commitment. While it's not quite as action packed as the original it still has plenty of amazing and awesomely choreographed fight scenes. If you like martial arts flicks you should love it (I'd say). I had a little bit of a tough time following the detailed story (and what was going on with all of the many different characters) but that was partially due to the fact that I couldn't always keep up with the subtitles. It's probably well worth repeat viewings, I think (to get more out of the detailed story). I'd say the first film is kind of like a martial arts version of a classic action film like 'DIE HARD' and this installment is more like the martial arts take on a great crime saga like 'THE GODFATHER'. It's truly epic and I can't wait to see what Evans does with the conclusion to this trilogy!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh0hmoLcuEo",

But, the fight choreographers made it all back in the last fight scenes! The kitchen scene is might favourite closely followed by the taxi scene.It's also set for a sequel if they want to and the tie-in to the first movie is a nice touch.

The copy in theaters right now is not dubbed so that made the movie viewing experience much more enjoyable. The movie is great for action junkies but the plot and storyline go everywhere. I went into this movie with the idea of seeing a great action flick with mind-blowing cinematic detail centered on fight scenes. I was impressed as you can tell the budget was much higher for Berandal than its predecessor. Gareth is an excellent director and he obviously took some cues from Takashi Miike as a few of the well known actor's from Miike flicks were in the film. You learn to make a film that will leave an impression on someone leaving the movie theater. This film did just that and even though I was the only patron in the whole theater it was money well spent. If there was one negative I would give this film is the director trying to build a dramatic storyline. My advice to him is to stick to what he knows and that is martial arts and action. My advice to you the reader is to watch this film and be ready for awe and amazement. Fingaz!",

            "content": "As I entered the London cinema to see this Indonesian movie, I overheard a bit of conversation between two people who had just seen it and were comparing it to the original. All I caught was a reference to \"more -ory\". I thought \"more gory\"? How could that be? But you'd be surprised what a man with a baseball bat and a girl with two hammers can do. Later I decided that the comment was \"more story\". And it is true that this sequel is altogether more open: over a period of years instead of hours; all over Jakarta rather than simply in one building; and involving three gangs rather one (not to mention corrupt police). So, if you enjoyed ultra-violent \"The Raid\" - and I loved it - you'll be more than satisfied with the gore-fest that is the follow-up which, while necessarily lacking the absolute novelty of the original, is - surprisingly for a sequel - just as good if not better. This is a contender for the best action movie of all time.The budget was bigger but still minuscule by Hollywood standards: just \u00a34.5M compared to a measly \u00a31M. Welshman Gareth Huw Evans writes, directs and edits again and Iko Uwais is back as Rama, the cop who is as hard and straight as a nail. So we expect a lot, but \"The Raid 2\" delivers with stunning action scenes in a whole variety of environments - the muddiest prison courtyard ever, a nightclub, a porn studio, a kitchen, a metro train, even a speeding car, and the inevitable corridor - and a terrific cast of villains. At times, one wonders why - like Indiana Jones in \"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\" - a character does not simply shoot his opponent rather than pummel him with hands and feet and why gangs of goons tend to line up for action rather than attacking all at once, but, heh, this is a martial arts movie and there are certain conventions to follow and the exposition of the Indonesian 'pencak silat' is no exception. In short, a fantastic movie.",

At one point, me and my brother literally stood from our seats from one intense kill. The action was literally jaw dropping and I never felt so much adrenaline from watching a movie.Aside from action, the story itself is great and deals with the clash of two mobs. Even when there isn't action on screen, I was still very interested in the dialogue driven scenes because they are too pretty suspenseful scenes. Being a 2 hour 30 min movie, it never felt like it slowed down and it kept my interest throughout the whole movie. If your a fan of action, crime dramas, or both. You will love this movie. 10/10",

It infused every fight scene as the good guy had nowhere to go but keep facing down those insurmountable odds (and the viewer was strapped right in with him). That kind of excitement doesn't happen in THE RAID 2 until a good two hours in, beginning with a mind-boggling car chase. For those first two hours, there's no shortage of fight scenes, to be sure, but they're so fast, furious and in your face that they actually (believe it or not) become numbing after awhile. And it's surprising how much of a backseat our hero cop takes in this movie, as the story plays out over various other characters. But it's when Rama retakes center stage that this movie gets back to its bread-and-butter: close-quarter combat. High-energy and dizzying fight scenes in cars, trains and in hallways, where the visceral action is in-your-face and unbelievably suspenseful. But when the end came, I didn't feel the fist-pumping adrenaline of the first movie; I felt like I'd been through an onslaught of grisly violence. Just one blood-spray after another.

            "content": "The Raid 2 is a long movie, but not a very interesting one. Starting up shortly after the last one ended, the hero goes undercover with the mob in search of police corruption, but the movie ignores that in favor of a perpetually uninteresting and occasionally confusing story centered on the son of the head mobster.It's interesting reading the reviews here because they are mainly favorable and focus on how much action there was even though I felt like the action was pretty thin for most of the movie. There are some big solid fights here and there, such as a muddy one in a prison yard, but there are also long stretches of action-less, tedious storytelling. I felt like I spent a tremendous amount of time waiting for anything interesting to happen, and it wasn't until very near the end that the pace picked up, notably with a big car battle and an exciting fight involving curved blades. User reviews describe this film as more action-packed than the original, but while there may be more action in total, I suspect there's less per minute; it doesn't feel packed by any means.I watched this movie because I really enjoyed the original, but before I compare the two I have to add the caveat that I don't remember the first one that well and am going from a general impression (I seem to have forgot to review it after I saw it).The first movie had a brilliant premise in that the whole movie was a cops vs. criminals battle in a single apartment building. Movies that close the participants in, like Die Hard or Alien, offer filmmakers a sort of built-in discipline, and The Raid was tightly focused because of its structure. The sequel, on the other hand, can go anywhere and does, resulting in something rambling and fuzzy.While I don't remember the details, I do remember it was one of those movies where I would say \"WOAH!\" out loud from time to time as something amazing happened. I did not say \"woah\" once during The Raid 2, although I did say \"ick\" a number of times. The violence is gory and sadistic, so even when it's clever and well-choreographed, as in some subway carnage involving hammers, I found it a bit much.With characters I didn't care about, a clich\u00e9d story that didn't make much sense, and action sequences spaced too far apart, this movie never pulled me in.

Since most people watch The Raid movies only for those scenes, I guess this is what you have to know.I, however, expected at least the semblance of a story, with actors that play characters that make rational choices or are just insane for some reason. In this film, a young cop accepts to go \"undercover\" in jail, where he spends several years, then becomes the right hand of the son of the man who he wants to trap, only to, at the end, kick everybody's ass.Why did he abandon his family to follow a long term plan that in the end, after an immense waste of time, he did not follow, no one explains. Why all those people are killing each other and themselves using short knives, baseball bats, metal rods, hammers, pickaxes, when they could just as easily carry guns is a mystery, as well. A sniper rifle would have been nice, or a grenade or two.I tried very hard not to be racist here, and I don't think I am, but with all the all member movements, loud shouting and exaggerated facial expressions, it felt like I was watching a movie about crazed monkeys killing each other. They all talked about how fast one should rise, the strategy of getting \"to the top\", but in the end they just talked and walked exactly the same, did the same pathetic things and moved around mechanically in order to fill the gaps in which the indomitable lead character fights everyone and defeats them with their own weapons.Bottom line: good action scenes, but as I could not understand or condone the motivations of the characters, it all seemed like choreographed ballet, with no story or evoking of emotion to speak about.",

The motivation and the character development were brief, but clear. The script was strong, but it was going only into one direction.The second movie \"The Raid: Berandal\" by the young master director Gareth Evans is a new look into the painful and elaborate world of pencak silat (the Indonesian martial art which flows through the movies of Mr. Evans). I would like to congratulate the director on achieving something new - he gave depth to the criminal organization behind the term \"bad guys in action movies\" which we rarely see in most of the movies from this genre. The script itself is nothing new - Rama (the main hero) goes undercover to avenge and to bring down the whole criminal syndicate which is the \"source for all the troubles in the world\". What I liked though is the way we see evil spawn from one generation to another. It is necessary to point out how Uco is different from his father Bangun. The most interesting thing for me was the expression of Uco's anger which generated from his lack of moral values and total egotism. We see different generations argue and fight over money, power and other silly things all the time, but it is important to note how the criminal environment can both spoil and bruise a young soul. It is so because the lack of love and compassion is so essential to the corruption of the human soul that it cannot be healed easily. One needs time to be able to reeducate and help. And even the family loses its value to the corrupted person. Thus being lost Uco cannot choose another path, but to end his own family in a disgusting manner. The moral blindness is irrevocable in many cases. That is why Bangun and Goto have rules - because they are not born criminals. They are not raised by criminals, they had to become criminals. Their part in this story is central because they help us spot the real criminal - the one soul which was born and raised as a criminal. And we all know - nobody is born to be only bad or good. We humans are all conflicted beings. We change, we evolve, we are not constant all the time. But Uco is. He can't escape his evil confinement because it is bred into him. And that is why Rama succeeds in ruining this whole syndicate - because nothing in life is one-sided. He uses his skills and knowledge to reach his goal - survive and win over them all - people who have rules and loyalty. Some things which Uco didn't have.So I think that this was a very good decision - to move the script towards this direction after the first movie.I'd like to point out also that there were several fight scenes which reminded to me about the ferocity and animosity of the first movie. This energy is essential for the success of \"The Raid\" movies after all...",

The result of such an exhausting length is that the quality moments - and there are plenty - are inevitably diluted by distention, languorous pacing and unnecessary padding. That's a shame because the fight scenes, though blood-soaked and sadistic in the extreme, are very well staged and executed. Ditto for the car chases. But they're ultimately no match for the muddled, often incoherent plotting that comes to dominate so much of the movie.There's a terrific 100-minute movie buried in there somewhere.

That's certainly not the case with The Raid 2, because I fell in love with it instantly.There are notable changes between this sequel and its predecessor, most noticeably being the story. 'The Raid' lacked any real writing, it had a story, but one so simple it was really used just to showcase the fighting. The Raid 2 features a story that, although it's treading on familiar territory, is engaging and believable, and contributes to making this sequel better than the first movie.The acting is great as well. Iko Uwais continues to do a great job, and I was particularly impressed by newcomer Afrin Putra. Julie Estelle and Very Tri Yulisman also deserve a special mention as they have very few lines of dialogue between them but are two hugely intimidating characters who are pretty ridiculous yet still hugely fun to watch. I always appreciate the actors in these movies a huge amount because of all the choreography they have to learn, which must be a very difficult task because the fighting scenes (like in the first Raid) are absolutely stunning.Every punch feels like it has an impact and cause actual pain. The violence is bloody, brutal and often hilarious. All the action moves so quickly yet I still feel as though I'm seeing everything that's going on and I'm not missing anything.

The kinetic was so over-the-top, it somehow reminds the audience why we adore this genre a lot. This sequel, The Raid 2, expands itself into some sort of a Hollywood like blockbuster. The difference here from the Western mainstream today is, this one is less artificial and is unafraid to show the true brutality and spirit of the action genre. Now it consists more psychopaths, corrupt politicians, and revenge. It may be a little soap operatic, but the hard-hitting punches and cold-blooded atmosphere still takes over the relentlessly fun experience.The first movie was just one mission gone awry, this sequel goes to the next level by turning the hero from law enforcer to a double agent. It is a tale which is strung by various subplots but only involving in one place, which is the corrupt side of society. There is too many stories to juggle on, apparently, which can feel quite heavy, but they are decently balanced anyway. It is by the way a two and a half hour experience, so there is more time to explore the arcs. Unfortunately, the only story we can find behind the main character, Rama, is his protection to his family. But really, we don't need much from the guy, because what really defines this hero is his fighting skills and that is already enough. However a more compelling character is Uco. His story might feel soap operatic at times, but when he finally turns to his violent nature, the danger of the plot becomes a big deal.The film indulges itself by adding more characters with ridiculous abilities to transcend the fights into something unique and way brutal. It may seem too campy for its serious situations, but the joyous of it makes it feel right for the story. This is in fact all about the martial arts, even when the story has gone out of hand with the flavor, the tension and the moves will still be the only things that would matter in the end. Every single set piece, it never stops surprising the audience. Each one has to be distinct, and of course, has something to do with destroying someone's body parts. It's an outright joy for releasing its intense madness.The direction is not only for the choreography. There are scenes that takes its time to breathe and think at the trouble that is about to happen or the information that is about to be revealed. It all goes silent, until it explodes like a ticking bomb. The version I saw is an English dubbed version and I can't really say enough about the acting. What I can only see in Iko Uwais so far is his skills are still badass yet able to be relatable. I can tell that Arifin Putra is ruthless as Uco, but also manifests a human grief beneath his sinister turn.The important advice for the viewers who don't speak its original language is to stick with the English subtitles. I don't know how many dubbed versions are out there, but the prominent one kind of negates the grittiness of the dialogue. Maybe at the original language, their line deliveries would sound a lot sincere. In other way, The Raid 2 defines how an awesomely dark action movie truly is. It can be a little silly, but it shows how real and none-CGI-ed stunts look like and it's not as friendly as your Hollywood superheroes tend to show you. The violence is the mind-blowing (literally and metaphorically) and the context is effectively grim. Just like the first film, it is enough to see a man beating up a load bad guys with his strength of five from one level to another. Except this one goes beyond your expectations.",

But decided in the end to go for a 9. Because there is quite the intriguing story, but also the action is quite phenomenal. So even with the lead not quite being there for the story (in my humble opinion), everything else works amazing. Don't expect this to be as action packed as the first one was. A bit of patience, but also downfalls when it comes to characters and story has to be there.When it comes to the action though ... bone crunching is a thing right? Like a literal thing. You can't be squeamish about these things. It will get brutal and the camera will not shy away from the violence. The way it is choreographed alone would have deserved a full point rating (see my dilemma again?). Gareth Evans is quite the talent when it comes to choreography and action related cinema.

The beginning was a tad slow for the type of movie this was, but once it got started, it became a veritable roller-coaster. The 3rd and final acts were primarily action, brutal and savage in its delivery. The subtitles seem to flow smoothly enough, and the early parts of the movie required more direct attention than should have been needed, as it bounced back and forth between 3 different times of the past simultaneously. Finally, Yayan Ruhian (Mad Dog from the first one) could have been better used than he was. He, and his character, would have made a much better final fight sequence -- though the one they did have was nothing to sneeze at.",

Several cast members went on to make cameo appearances in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.In Raid 2, Honest cop Rama (Iko Uwais) reluctantly accepts an assignment by an anti corruption unit to expose a corrupt chief of police Reza who is in league with city mobsters Bangun (Tio Pakusodewo) and Goto (Kenichi Endo.)Rama has to go deep undercover as Yuda, by being imprisoned and get close to Bangun's son Uco (Arifin Putra) which he does by saving his life in prison when a mob attacks.Two years later Yuda after being released from prison he is hired by Bangun to work in their organisation. Yuda discovers that Uco is unhappy with his father's conciliatory behaviour towards his rivals which he sees as a weakness. Goaded by a rival gang lord who is pushing Uco's buttons, Uco plans to take control of his father's gang. Yuda finds himself in great danger.The film's plot is inspired by movies such as The Departed and The Godfather. In contrast to the first film, the sequel concentrates on a story more than the action. I found it flabby and rather dull outside of the action scenes which were still frenetic and frenzied.",

            "content": "The Raid 2 is a movie that does many things right but most importantly it understands how important escalation can be for a sequel. The premise of the first film is pretty much a one and one done deal considering that it was as simple as the plot of a Martial Arts film could get without the inclusion of a fighting tournament. Conversely The Raid 2 aims to be a full blown crime saga with factions, character arks, double crosses all while maintaining the lightning fast, ultra-visceral style of martial arts filmmaking that was present in the last installment.After the events of the first film our hero Rama (played in this installment with a surprising amount of emotion by Iko Uwais) is drafted into an undercover branch of Jakarta's police force. He infiltrates the Indonesian dominated crime syndicate by way of the crime boss's son Uco. Once that is accomplished he soon becomes embroiled in a series of double crosses, secret allegiances, and the threat of a war breaking out between the Indonesian and Japanese crime syndicates in Jakarta. All of this is coupled with the ever looming threat of discovery and death at the hands of the very criminals he's betrayingWhile The Raid 2 unsurprisingly keeps up the high quality of action the previous film set up what is surprising is how well The Raid 2 works as a straightforward crime thriller. Both director Gareth Evans and lead actor Iko Uwais acquit themselves greatly in dramatic roles. Evans prior films illustrated that he was without a doubt one of the best action directors working today but they only hinted at his abilities as a suspense director and never hinted at his abilities as a director of drama. Yet The Raid 2 is filled with interesting, engaging characters on top a taut, tense and ultimately explosive story line that spans years whereas the first installment only spanned days.Thematically the story feels like a natural progression from the first. The first Raid illustrated what it was like to be on the front lines of Jakarta's inner city violence and hinted at the wider web of corruption keeping the status quo as it was. On the flip side The Raid 2 openly reveals that web of corruption. What results is something that feels weightier and more captivating on a narrative level than the prior film.The actor's also help the film a lot; Arifin Putra and Tio Pakusadewo in particular. Their dynamic as father and son is the most fascinating of the entire film. Putra is ruthless; but also brash and more than a little bit of a sociopath. Pakusadewo is reserved and calculating but also deeply worried about the fate of his son.As for the action; it is truly next level stuff. If there was any doubt that Gareth Evans is one of today's supreme action talents those feelings are squashed by the set pieces in this film. Every camera movement makes you feel the impact, every fight is perfectly choreographed. But when the film really hits its stride is when the fights start getting creative. Guns, knives, feet, fists, glass, tables, bats, pipes, hammers, doors, cars even baseballs are thrown into the mix. It's a level of dynamism that makes every fight feel unpredictable but satisfying.The Raid 2 is stellar on just about every level and makes for a perfect sequel. Bigger, weightier, and gripping The Raid 2 can stand toe to toe with any of it's contemporary Asian crime cinema counterparts.",

This is a truly visceral film. The action is filmed with long takes and I can't even begin to imagine the complications of focus pulling and the crew hitting all of their marks to pull off scene after scene. The filmmaking feels invisible, which is the highest compliment I could give a movie that's all smoke and mirrors, but actually looks like dozens of people were really pounding each other's faces in.

            "content": "When it was released back in 2011, The Raid easily took over the mantle of the greatest pure action movie since Enter the Dragon. Unknown faces, one killing machine of a cop trapped in a 30 floor building with 200 ruthless gangsters baying for his blood, and incredibly choreographed silat fights made for a glorious, uninterrupted gore fest. While it was made for a specific audience, who enjoy bloodbaths, but all those who watched it came back happy. The Raid revitalized the martial arts genre and raised the standard of action to a whole new level. Back then, who would have thought that The Raid could be bettered?Impossible is nothing.Director Gareth Evans comes back with the sequel- The Raid 2, that, incredibly so, betters the first film in every possible manner. The first movie was a simple black and white tale- good cops pitted against crazed thugs, and all the film-making creativity focused on the fights. The sequel is much more nuanced, with characters who are different shades of gray, and integrates Ang Lee style artsy touches that add depth to what is essentially a crash boom bang story. Out goes the singular location focused threadbare plot, in comes a sprawling, ambitious canvas, a crime thriller that draws from classic Asian thrillers of the past, such as Infernal Affairs, Hard Boiled, Oldboy and Lady Vengeance, to create a martial arts version of The Godfather.The film picks up right where the first one ends. No sooner has Rama (Iko Uwais) made it out alive from that killing zone of a building, that he gets pulled into an undercover mission to infiltrate Jakarta's underworld to weed out corrupt police men. It is an arduous and lengthy task-one that starts with him getting thrown into prison. Cut to the first fight- shot within the confines of a toilet, with Rama taking on 30 guys one by one, and creating a mountain of knocked bodies before going down. Rama's mission is to get close to Uco- the scion of a crime syndicate, and to do that he saves his life in dramatic fashion. Cut to fight number two- a bloodbath in the mud, where prisoners take on prison guards. Uco wants to emerge out of his father's shadows, and to this end he allies himself with a rival gangster, Bejo. Rama further wins Uco's faith in another fight sequence where he helps take down some rivals. Fight number three. The plot begins to get convoluted from here onwards involving themes such as crime family power struggles, corruption and daddy issues.While the lead characters are adequate, it is the henchmen and women that bring in their unique psychotic violence design that make things really interesting. There is a guy who bashes heads to pulp with a baseball bat, a girl in shades, wielding two hammers that smash and rip in unison, a brutally composed assassin who fights with two curved daggers, and of course Yayan Ruhian (Mad Dog in the last movie) as a vagabond killer. Each of them get a cult status entry that showcases their skills- so four more fights, including one in a snowing street. It never snows in Indonesia but who cares- blood looks damn good on white snow! Rama is captured when Uco kills his father and cleans up his old gang. Cut to fight number eight- a crazy car chase sequence in which Rama kills his captors and takes control of the car. But it is the final 30 minutes that I will take to my grave. Rama singlehandedly finishes off two gangs, including all the aforementioned star henchmen. The rules of martial arts movies are at play here- to maximize impact, the throngs of henchmen do not attack together but wait for their turn, and there are hardly any guns at their disposal. But the sheer brutality, intensity and energy blows everything away, and the end kitchen scene knife-fight is jaw-dropping in itself, easily besting the climactic fight in the previous movie, which itself was out of the world.That it took a Welshman working in the Indonesian film industry to revive the martial arts genre speaks volumes about the levels of globalization the film industry is undergoing today. Gareth Evans is probably the best action film director today. Merantau, The Raid and now this has definitely raised the bar for others to follow. No CGI, no wires, just pure, awesome action. While he has pulled plot threads from other movies, the impact is original, and memorable. The movie itself might feel a bit long, but is necessary to accommodate all the characters and their individual story arcs. The ending promises Raid 3, and for action fans, there could not have been better news in 2014.Impossible is nothing. 10/10",

            "content": "The movie opens with a long, wide, and distant shot of cloudy fields with something going on in the lower left corner. Some bearded villain has someone executed after giving one of those only-in-the-movies speeches. Next we meet Rama, the hero from the first raid, right after it's over. He's sitting next to some guy and facing some other guy who shoots the guy next to him. The guy in front of him now tries to recruit him to some secret off-the-books police unit to clean up the city. Rama rejects the offer but then accepts it. To the police brass he will be presented as another corpse resulting from the raid. Meanwhile he'll be undercover in jail, to get close to the son of the one of the city's bad guys.That gives us a couple of fights in jail, including a huge all-male mud fight for some reason. I think in that fight Rama saves the son of the bad guy who's now indebted to him. Years later he gets Rama out of jail and introduces him to his dad who hires him to work with his son doing menial tasks like dealing with problems of payment-collection. We are introduced to some homeless guy martial arts expert who works for the dad. We are told there's a 10 year truce in the city between the dad, the bearded bad guy, and the Japanese. Son is mighty frustrated though as he's being treated as a low employee by the dad. He wants to take the reigns of the organization. But he's also one arrogant elitist pig who thinks himself superior to everyone else.One day bearded guy proposes the son a deal--to start a war between the dad's group and the Japanese so the son will end up in charge. All this in exchange for some real estate the the Japanese own. Son accepts. The first move is to kill the homeless killer and blame it on the Japanese. But dad won't fall for it, he doesn't start a war. Bearded guy has 3 wicked assassins--a girl that uses two hammers, a guy with a baseball bat, and a martial arts expert. They orchestrate a simultaneous campaign to kill Japanese. Suddenly cops go after Rama. After beating them up, Rama arrives at the dad's office to find out the son is coming clean about his plans. Rama now has to reveal that he's not on the side of the son. Now the assassins go after him.The Raid 2 doesn't feature a raid. It really doesn't have a lot to do with the first part other than the presence of the Rama character and that the story starts soon after the end of the first. This movie is 2 hours 30 minutes long. And unlike the first movie, very little of that is fight scenes. There are occasional bouts of violence in between lots of story. But here's the problem, while the violence is quick and fast, the rest of the movie is s l o w. The story itself shouldn't take up that much time, but what gets in the way is the director's overbearing concern with style. And this movie is stylish. At times it feels like browsing through a modern interior design magazine, in slow motion. The director's signature shot of the camera rolling forward slowly a couple of inches in a rectangular space gets tiring and is pointless. When there is action it's violent, bloody, gory, Westernized. In fact it's less about the choreography here than about camera work and jarring editing. But only few action scenes truly stand out--the chase scene and the final confrontation with the assassins. The rest is just so-so. The entire jail scenes are lame. I don't understand what is it about jails that fascinate movie-makers. Probably that it's an all-male environment. And the mud-wrestling scene is utterly confusing, you can't tell who's who and what's the whole point. Well, the point is the mud-wrestling scene, but when it happens it not nearly as impressive as the director thinks. Another problem is that Rama isn't much of a leading character. He doesn't get to do much and for a good part of the movie seemed to just not be there. It's not easy for me to review this movie independently of The Raid: Redemption. If you're like me and were blown away by that movie and were looking forward to the sequel, then you'll probably end up disappointed as I was. Sure this movie is bigger, longer, more polished, with more story. It just lacks the exhilaration, the fascination, the madness, the genius of the first one. The Raid 2 perhaps is too ambitious for its own good. The director knows how to direct action...dialogue not so much. And he's a far better director than he is an editor. This movie could have been saved with tighter editing that focuses more on story and action and less on empty style. The Raid 2, while not as groundbreaking as The Raid 1, still puts Hollywood action to shame and is a unique ode to violence.",

Most of this is disposable too, simply style.In other words they wanted to be ambitious here, big, but their ideas about being big and cinematic are wholly uninteresting to see, and so the film in my eyes ended up being like one of the many fancy locales seen in the film, upscale apartments and restaurants, simply a lot of chintz and wallpaper, losing the concentration that made the first tick.There's still of course the fighting, it's bloody, but now in the context of all this empty-headed spending that ends up adding only size and aesthetic, and this is the same degree to which the story of corruption adds only plot, it appears overwrought and ignorant.",

Rarely do we nowadays get to experience the kind of high-octane rush that the first Raid provided. Let me stop there. Back in 2012, The Raid was tremendously lauded by many, delivering on brutality and satisfying action. For the first time, we didn't have to deal with banal car chases and humdrum gun fights. The characters herein got down and dirty, resorting to ferocious hand-to-hand combat\u2014the picture incorporating a little technique called \"Silat\" or, let's just say, martial arts in broader terms. All things being considered, The Raid was simply an immensely enjoyable, energetic action film at the end of the day. That's where the Raid 2 comes in, promising dramatic improvement and fully delivering. Most importantly, the martial arts are back, and it's more vicious than ever before\u2014the sheer amount of bone crunches and heavy-handed strikes that make you groan in your theater seat. The movie markedly ramps up the violence in this follow-up with greater pools of blood and gore. Not only are we presented with hand-to-hand combat between two fierce fighters but the film's also pervaded with shootouts, sword fighting, painful beatings\u2014oh, and a grandiose bout of mud wrestling in a prison! I can't begin to even describe just how many times I literally cringed in my seat at the sight of such purely merciless, tumultuous violence\u2014 limbs breaking, heads being bashed in, throats being slashed, etc. We don't get too many R-rated action films like this anymore, and it's likely because most moviegoers wouldn't even be able to stomach the vividly realistic violence depicted within. Now, along with the violence, obviously, we also have the highly entertaining brawls. The choreography is beyond that of amazing when considering the arrant swiftness and methodical nature of these fights (truly a jaw-dropping display). We really are treated with some of the best fights/action sequences I've ever seen\u2014incredibly fast-paced, excruciatingly graphic, and perfectly coherent with the help of the capable camera. Most of the time, action movies like this suffer from a terribly shaky camera, wholly inept at capturing the fights without confusing its audience. What's even transpiring in the scene\u2014who's hitting who and with what? In this case, everything's remarkably clear, which results in even more unalloyed enthusiasm as they proceed. The camera-work is brilliant, serving to be as immersive as possible (twisting, blurring, and dropping along with the combatants that it's following). As clich\u00e9d as this might sound, the viewers are thus placed as close to the frenetic action as they could ever possibly get at a cinema. In addition, the stupendously kinetic editing services the furious vigor of the moment as well, completely arresting our eyes throughout the entire showing. Rarely am I so engrossed but it seriously felt like I could never possibly tire of this movie. Moreover, not only was the action astoundingly engaging but as opposed to the first installment's rather weak plot, the story in this one felt extensively superior. A vastly enthralling crime-thriller narrative was implemented into the whole heat of the fray, and unlike most foreign martial arts film, it never felt like the clashes in between were randomly and lazily inserted or the story unnecessarily existing only to lead into the subsequent epic battles. No, a total game of politics, revenge, betrayal, jealousy, ratting, and gang wars demonstrates itself therein, and, wow, is it utterly exhilarating. With that being said, the substantially expanded plot can also occasionally step into convoluted territory due to the profusion of characters introduced and their ties. All in all, The Raid 2 is undoubtedly one of my favorite films of 2014 so far. In spite of the innumerable Captain America's, Pacific Rim's, and whatnot, I sincerely can say that I haven't had this much relish with and admiration for an action movie in a long, long time.",

An Indonesian cop/martial arts master/family man is tasked with raiding a castle-like fortress occupied by criminals waiting to be rewarded for gruesomely killing our hero. On the top floor is the big boss and the cop's brother, but before he gets there like any good console game he has to use his wits and skills to outsmart groups of progressively deadlier assassins as he scales the building to protect his family.There was a supreme mix of action and plot, just the right amount of character and background but not so much it drowned the story. It was enough that the protagonist had a brother and a wife he cared about and he was fighting for them. It's most comparable to Die Hard, no one really gave a damn about Molly McLane past the fact that John wanted her alive. McTiernan spent a bit of time setting this up and then had Bruce Willis scale FOX HQ for two hours to get her back.Many movies get it wrong. The recent 'Conan the Barbarian' film spent no real time on establishing the characters in a high fantasy cult world, there was endless action which no one understood or cared about. I saw Conan at the Empire film festival in London surrounded by a thousand other film nuts and Khal Drogo himself. No one applauded or said anything, we were scared if anyone piped up we'd get an Arakh to the face, or maybe a molten crown. The flip side are the appalling action films like 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' which only have a few minor action sequences and spend an hour establishing a relationship between Kenneth Branagh and Keira Knightly which we don't care about.Watching the Raid series is akin to watching Police Story or some of the old Jet Li films; the martial arts sequences are novel, the plots are brief and solely serve the purpose of furthering the action. The language is very blunt and the limited dialogue conveys emotion and motivation better than any character diatribes.The Raid 2 takes a leaf from A Song of Ice and Fire and kills off the protagonist's brother, the macguffin of the first movie, in the first three minutes to set up the story. Evans recognised that characters are secondary to the interests of progressing the plot and many are expendable to develop complex and visually fulfilling action sequences. The sequel takes the slaughter outside the confines of one building and spreads through nightclubs, prison yards and busy streets.Most notable are the contained fights which take place in small confined spaces like a bathroom stall at the beginning of the film or in the backseat of an SUV with four henchmen. In 1971 Sean Connery made history in 'Diamonds are Forever' by having a fight in a tiny elevator. Most fight scenes are spread out and involve widespread destruction of property, but when Bond drew his elbow back to punch the other guy in the lift he broke the glass behind him, alerting the henchman to his plan. Connery later joked that his next fight would be in a telephone box. Our hero manages to fight two outlandish assassins wielding baseball bats and hammers in a small hallway and defeat both guards and inmates in a mud-drenched prison yard.Please make more films like this, I don't go to a movie called 'The Raid' to find out about the human condition or the meaning of it all. What I want is a knight to scale the castle, slay the bad guys and rescue his honour and that of his family. Originally published on TodaytoKnights on Wordpress and Tumblr.",

However he finds out that the criminal opponents in the building were only small fish compared to the larger ones still out to stop, his actions and the triumph of the police force has attracted the attention of criminal predators in the hierarchy of gangland, as the only man left alive his family, his infant son and wife, are in danger. Rama's only choice is to go undercover in the criminal underworld, by posing as a criminal himself, routing his way around the competing forces and find the corrupt politicians and police officer pulling the strings and threatening the peace, therefore Rama takes on the persona of violent offender \"Yuda\", forcing him to leave behind his personal life and history, starting with a stint is prison where he mingles with the other inmates to gain their trust. In prison it is his mission to gain the confidence of Uco (Arifin Putra), the son of a prominent gang kingpin, and eventually out of the cell he is accepted as part of the gang, and slowly Rama lays his life on the line and manoeuvres ever closer to the head honcho. Rama is found out as an undercover police officer and has no choice but to battle his way through the enemy warehouse and various security guards, gangsters, criminals and killers to get out alive, the film ends with him killing Uco and all his thugs, those who placed him in this situation look ready to send him on another assignment, but he states that he is done. Also starring Tio Pakusodewo as Bangun, Oka Antara as Eka, Alex Abbad as Bejo, Yayan Ruhian as Prakoso, Julie Estelle as Alicia 'Hammer Girl', Cok Simbara as Bunawar, Kenichi End\u00f4 as Hideaki Goto, Ry\u00fbhei Matsuda as Keichi, Donny Alamsyah as Andi, Very Tri Yulisman as Baseball Bat Man and Cecep Arif Rahman as The Assassin. Whereas the first film was simply just a raid in a building, this has more of a feel similar to The Godfather, in that is not just a mission to defeat the villains, it is a complex power struggle to bring down the kingpins. You could argue that this sequel is a bit more chatty, and it is perhaps a bit longer than it needs to be, an hour and a half to be precise, but is doesn't matter too much, what makes this film what it is a B-movie feel, with its great high octane martial arts fight sequences, many variety of gun and metal weapons all over the place, and of course much more bloody ultra violence with the hero essentially ripping up the bad guys, an entertaining and inventive action thriller.

I went into it without any knowledge of what it was about. The action sequences in the film are done by truly magnificent Silat (Indonesian fight art)masters. There's no flying through trees or garbage from a fantasy land. This is technical, fast, mind blowing and often gruesome fight scenes! There are points you might feel the urge to turn your head but you just cant! Iko Uwais who plays the lead role is AWESOME! I'm an overnight fan! Yayan Ruhian choreographed the scenes and has a good role as well and he is also AWESOME! There are half a dozen martial artist in this movie that stand out HUGE and you will know who I'm talking about once you've seen it. If Hollywood is watching they would do well to scoop these folks up and get them to LA. Bottom line...watch it.

            "content": "2012's The Raid was one of the most efficient action films ever made, eschewing deep characters and story in favor of numerous action sequences. And the only reason it was made was because the writer/director, Gareth Evans, was unable to secure funding for his first-choice project. As it turns out, The Raid 2 was that project. After the success of the first one, and a few story changes to integrate the surviving characters into the previously-standalone work, Evans has finally made the movie he always wanted. And it shows. The Raid 2 is superior to the first in almost every way. The story is far more intricate this time, a tale of two major crime syndicates teetering on the brink of war. The action scenes have been enhanced as well, bigger in scale than anything in the first movie, and considerably more brutal. Suffice it to say that the squeamish need not apply. The Raid 2 is better written, better acted, and better filmed than The Raid, and is the best action film I have seen in recent memory. I will be very, very surprised if The Raid 2 doesn't end up in the list of my top three movies of 2014.",

            "content": "\"The Raid: Redemption\" has been one of the most exciting action movies of the past years and I was eager to watch its follow-up \"The Raid 2: Berandal\". I took quite a ride to watch this movie in a small cinema in its original language with English subtitles and this movie was definitely worth all the time and money.To my surprise, this movie was quite different from the first one. \"The Raid: Redemption\" is a fast-paced and emotionally thrilling action movie in a closed environment with a lot of shooting sequences. \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" is an epic gangster movie with a more complex story line, a high diversity of settings and much more physical fighting sequences that always surprise. One also follows different characters throughout the movie and not only the main character. These perspective changes keep the movie interesting until the end as it's a quite long film.On the negative side, it was sometimes quite hard to follow the story because there are a lot of new characters and names to keep on your mind. In the beginning, one doesn't always get who are Bejo, Bunawar, Eka, Prakoso, Reza, Uco and many other supporting characters. Main character Rama is working as an undercover agent inside the Bangun gang under the name Yuda to gain their respect and to investigate and eventually bring down their criminal activities involving other foreign and local gangs as well as the police itself. There are a lot of intriguing conspiracies going on in this movie. The whole story made me think a lot of the Korean movie \"New World\" that came out in 2013, starring Hwang Jung-Min, Lee Jung-Ae and the legendary Choi Min-Sik. With a running time of two hours and a half, \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" has though a few minor lengths in comparison to the first film but the story is overall more ambitious.Another minor issue I didn't appreciate was the fact that one could not really connect with the different characters. This was different in the first movie where some young police officers committed some heroic acts of bravery and where the main character had to deal with some very intriguing family issues. Right in the beginning of the sequel, the two other surviving characters of the first movie are out of the story and the main character's brother won't have its comeback either apart of a few unimportant scenes. Instead, one gets introduced to a lot of new and not very profound or sympathetic characters in the organized crime. Some characters feel even slightly ripped off from other movies. The Hammer Girl character for example makes me think of the South Korean masterpiece \"Old Boy\".On a side note, it was great to have Yahan \"Mad Dog\" Ruhian back on board. His initial villain character died in the first film but the actor is back in a new role as a loyal and poor assassin who has a troublesome life on the streets without his family. This character was pretty much the most human and interesting one in the entire movie. This actor simply has a lot of charisma.The action scenes in this movie are brilliant. They are even far above the quality of the exciting first part. The choreographies are maybe among the best ever done in a martial arts movie. The settings are highly diversified: cars, discotheques, factories, kitchens, prisons, trains and more. The different weapons are also addicting: baseball bats and balls, hammers, knives, sabres, sickles, different guns from sniper rifles to Uzis and off course hand and feet. The fighting scenes are sometimes raw and wild, sometimes aesthetic and virtuous, sometimes fast and ruthless, sometimes brutal and slow. One can see a lot of bones and necks breaking, heads exploding and diverse body parts flying around in bloody rain. The atmosphere of the fighting scenes also changes from desperate over disgusting to elegant. There are even a few macabre and humorous parts that help to digest the pitiless fighting scenes. They are diversified and original. They never get boring. This movie really sets news standards in its genre.\"The Raid 2: Berandal\" is definitely one of the very best modern action movies. Few people will argue about this. The action sequences are diversified and always spectacular. The choreographies and the settings as well as the camera work and the sound effects are excellent. The plot needs some time to unfold and has its strong parts but also a few minor lengths. The characters in this movie are of an average quality and mostly less interesting than in the first film. In the end, this will probably be the most exciting action movie of the year so you should definitely not miss it despite its minor flaws. I'm already eager to purchase this movie and get to see another sequel. \"The Expandables\" and Co. are kindergarten compared to this franchise.",

I kept thinking maybe they were showing something from the past. and that entire story-line was completely irrelevant to the story. they tried to give him a backstory with an ex-wife that won't let him see his son. he was introduced an hour into the movie and ended up dying not too long after. but not before adding like 20 minutes of useless story to the movie.",

The piece is undeniably larger than its predecessor - in scale, scope, ambition and, even, run-time - but it could be argued that the efficiency and purity of vision of that same predecessor has been somewhat lost. Instead of an unrelenting, pulse-pounding survival movie, this is a sweeping crime epic told through the lens of an undercover cop drama. Its protagonist, Rama, gets sort of lost during its midsection, treading water amidst a sea of crooks, killers and corrupt cops. He doesn't have all that much impact on the plot, outside of the finale, but he's still a compelling character for the audience to root for. At its core, the film is still an action flick. Along with its crime drama trappings, it does, of course, have plenty of brutal, balletic and brilliantly choreographed action. Some of this stuff must have been a nightmare to shoot, but it makes for some spectacular set-pieces. The fight sequences are all exciting, energetic and impactful. The finale, especially, makes excellent use of escalating tension and visual storytelling as our hero fights his way towards the big bad in one last attempt to finish things off. It's great stuff, enthralling and suspenseful. Though the film as a whole isn't quite as effective as its predecessor, it's still one of the best action movies in recent memory. Although the story sometimes gets in its own way, it's still an engaging and entertaining vehicle for the flick's fighting. In fact, it's clear that story came first in this case, leading to a holistic and satisfying experience that should keep you hooked throughout. 8/10",

The film lacks the originality of the first film in the sense that it is not as unique. It also doesn't have the level of suspense the first film had and the killings in the first film were more appropriate and acceptable. The police in the 'The Raid' were literally fighting for their lives, whereas 'The Raid 2' has killings left, right and center purely for the thrill of it (I suppose...). I also miss the thumping music that added to the adrenaline rush of the first film. This film is also much longer, and therefore slower moving. Be warned, this film is definitely not for everyone, as it is insanely violent. Some scenes were almost unwatchable due to the brutality. In many instances, I found it unnecessarily gory and graphic.Having said this, 'The Raid 2' is an exceptionally well made film. It is stunningly photographed with great cinematography. The fight sequences are incredibly well choreographed and probably the best fighting scenes you will ever see (for a while, at least). The chase scene towards the end was AMAZING!!

While The Raid was just over 90 minutes of heart-pumping, wince- inducing entertainment, it's sequel attempts to actually develop a plot.Starting just a few hours after the events of the first film, Rama (Iko Uwais), strikes a deal with Bunawar (Cok Simbara), the leader of an anti-corruption task force, to infiltrate the criminal gangs overrunning the city. After assaulting the son of a politician who opposed the family of crime-lord Bangun (Tio Pakusodewo), Rama is sent to prison, where Bangun's unpredictable and ambitious son Uco (Arifin Putra) is currently serving time. Rama saves Uco's life in a prison riot and earns his trust, so when he is released, Rama goes to work for Bangun as an enforcer. But with Uco growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of opportunities given to him by his father, he is drawn into a plot with Bejo (Alex Abbad), another criminal, to set up a war between the two rival families and prosper from the chaos.Like many Asian mob movies, The Raid 2 is littered with scenes in which indistinguishable overlords talk in dark rooms, talking in riddles and beating round the bush in scenes of heavy exposition that do little but over-complicate what is a rather simple plot. The film is confusing when it really shouldn't be, concentrating more on atmosphere rather than just getting to the point and letting the movie play out. It leads to a pretty exhausting 150-minute running time, and makes us wait a long, long time before unleashing a wholly satisfying, 45 minute blood-stained climax.If you thought the fight scenes in the first film were brutal, then Evans unleashes a whole new world of painful deaths and maiming. It's also more cartoonish, introducing a female assassin who carries two hammers, and another who seems to know every possible way you can bash a man's head in with a baseball bat. CGI blood is everywhere, and also facial burns, shattered jaws, and protruding bones. Evans also gives us his first attempt at a car chase, and it instantly becomes one of the greatest chases ever. He has a real gift for violence, and it's actually quite unnerving just how much enjoyment I got out of watching the mayhem unravel. Although it struggles to tell an interesting story, especially with Rama going AWOL for large chunks of the film, there is really nothing else like it out there.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

Therefore I must say, that even though it wasn't what I was expecting, it still was pretty effing amazing! I'm still amazed at how they managed to make all those stunts look so real, and just simple deliver more and more, every time going one step further. Although I still felt like the running time of 2 hr and 30 min, was too long, mostly because of all the plot and new characters being introduced. But once the action started going on one after another, I didn't want the movie to end. I felt like the second half was way better because it was all about the action instead of setting the story and characters. Two new characters that I really enjoyed and hoped they had more on-screen time were the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat Man' because the way they fought was very new to the movie, as well as extremely refreshing and gritty. But my favorite, hands down was 'Hammer Girl', not only because it was the first female to be incorporated in both The Raid movies, but also because of her skills. I really was expecting her to be more on the movie, or just to have a more important role, but at least when she was on-screen she kicked ass. And finally, the last fight was one of the best I've seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat and it just made a knot out of my nerves. It was extremely well staged and just unbelievably full of adrenaline. Overall, it is one of the best action films I've seen, and even though I'm not quite sure if it's better than the first. I'm 100% that it's nothing less impressive and action packed than the first movie, if not it exceeds it in unbelievably creative action sequences, while the pace of the story is not as great as its prequel. 5/5 Stars",

So in this sequel we follow our sole survivor, Rama, who must go undercover in order to protect his family from his new hardcore reputation that is making him popular in the criminal underworld. I'll start with the negatives, the first half was an absolute drag. This did not need to be 150 minutes long, at all. Could've easily established the power hungry Uco, who has major daddy issues, in a solid 20 minutes as opposed to an hour. So the long runtime and slow paced first half are my only complaints. This, as an action film, is absolutely insane. The Indonesian Terminator from the predecessor has now been substituted by a hammer wielding deaf girl, a well aimed baseball bat wielding guy (who can kill by hitting baseballs with insane precision...) and the ultimate blade wielding badass since Blade himself. That kitchen fight sequence was savage. The choreography was perfection, I've never shouted \"YEAH! STAB HIM!!\" so much. Evidently, watching this is releasing my inner murderous personality. The action set pieces were creative, from decimating prisoners in mud to a frantic car chase in downtown Jakarta...majestic. Some technical excellence from Evans, who performed such a great tracking shot that consists of going through 3 different cars in a chase scene. The use of blood and gore is ridiculously insane, great makeup effects. Even the no nonsense dialogue was insanely savage. Did I mention this film was both savage and insane?

We end up caring what happens to each of these characters, and though that has always been director/editor Evans' strength, right from 'Merantau'.I can't even pick my fav action sequence: should it be the car chase action, or should it be the HammerGirl+BaseballBoy on Rama action, or the final sequence in the Hotel's kitchen, or the prison riot, or the Koso-in-the-bar sequence? Not sure anymore.The first one did not get a theatrical release locally (except for a badly dubbed-into- local-language version, that I had no interest in watching), but I had the pleasure of watching it twice on the big screen, along with the sub-titles needed to 'get' where the story was going. The story in the first one was sparse, so it was no matter. This one's more dense, and watching the sub-titled version might have been a bigger challenge, but I ultimately ended up watching an English-dubbed version (both Indonesian as well as Japanese dialogues are now in English, but they retained the actual names of all characters, and the voice-acting was not as bad as the ones in the dubbed Cantonese movies I watched in the 80s and the 90s).The soundtrack, predominantly Trance-themed, is more than just apt for this, and enhances the impact of each and every sequence that its used in (and it IS used sparingly, since I could hear people breaking noisily into their popcorn/nachos during all of those sequences).Each shot is carefully composed, and the cinematography is top-notch. I just can't wait to watch this one (again) already, but it's outa the cinemas in 1 week, since there has been absolutely no pre-release publicity about the movie at all, and even the newspapers do not have a separate ad about it (in fact, if I had not gone to skim thru the show-times of a few cinemas, I wouldn't have gotten to know about it playing already, the same thing that happened to 'Nebraska').I do have a few complaints, esp. one about the sequence where one of the lead characters, who's shown to be very careful about making/taking calls using the 'right' number, for no reason, is not careful about the same aspect. Another thing - why the main leads chose the form of denouement that they ultimately did, is also something that either I am missing some key aspect about (or the censors made me miss it), or the writers were.All in all, those minor grouses aside, this is the definitive action masterpiece that needs to be enjoyed only on the big screen. And yes, you Do need a hard stomach to enjoy it unflinchingly.",

            "content": "The badass cop from the first film penetrates yakuza-like gangs by going undercover hoping to expose more of the corruption unveiled in his police force. There's the plot; in my opinion though, it's openly just a vehicle for the bewitching action sequences that put this series on the map.Welsh director Gareth Evans knows how to put together a fight scene. The hand to hand combat in particular was so brilliant in his first film \"Merantau\" and the original \"The Raid\" that the latter is now one of the most popular foreign language films on Netflix. Expanding on this, \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" attempts to go bigger and better on all fronts and for the most part succeeds.19 times. My mouth went dry 19 times, unbeknownst to me it just hung open during each fight scene and I think that reaction is exactly what the film is going for. These are some of the most inventive, chaotic and yet poetic action sequences filmed in recent years. Silat martial arts as well as a combination of other disciplines are demonstrated masterfully by the main characters, including a return of the \"dog\". Watching Iko Uwais perform all his own stunts was actually quite refreshing too as there aren't many people in cinema nowadays willing to take such risks. Furthermore, there are also lots of people firing guns which is always good.The first fight of the film is contained in a toilet cubicle in prison where Rama (Uwais) takes down 15 men on his own through rapid attack and defense. The handycam action is so engaging, it literally dances round the action. In fact, the cubicles in this scene were built on expandable hinges so the camera could slip beside and behind Rama as the challengers filed in, this and more was explained in the wicked behind the scenes videos available on Vimeo.Evans gives us fight scenes just about everywhere. Offices, restaurants, nightclubs and muddy prison grounds among others become battlegrounds and he uses each environment in combination with awesome choreography to make each engagement completely unique. On a boggy, muddy surface? Try and drown your enemy in it. In a bar? Throw every glass and smash every bottle in reach. The multitude of locations is much more visually stimulating and allows Evans to apply his own style to extra elements such as car chases previously unavailable as the entirety of the first film occurred in one building.The film is 50 minutes longer than its predecessor however and I don't think it needed to be. \"The Raid 2\" attempts to humanize characters that in my opinion are better off remaining one-dimensional and introduces a multitude of other characters which in some instances make the story a little complicated. At the same time though, Hammer Girl and\u0085 let's call him \"Bat-Boy\" (potentially inspired by Team Fortress 2?) are pretty astounding in the way their weapons of choice are incorporated into their fighting style. Also, the most convincing performances come from non-combat characters such as Bejo, our villain, and Uco, the overly- ambitious son of the Asian Godfather equivalent. In fact, an overly civilized meeting of the heads of the houses reminded me massively of \"The Godfather\" and also punching the wall in prison of \"Oldboy\", possible nods of the head?\"The Raid 2\" is a spectacle. If you loved the fast-paced brawls of the first one, the sequel is the same but on crack with a story that might rope you in emotionally too but probably won't.I loved it, 8 out of 10 from me.",

THE NOT SO GOOD: Suspension of disbelief is too much at times. The movie keeps trying too much to be like Kill Bill with a sense of predictability when any important character is about to fight 20 to 30 people..you know they are all going to be dead even though the main protagonist is outnumbered 30 to 1! The first half of the movie totally forgets guns were invented a century back and suddenly they appear and disappear in the second half based on how much martial arts needs to be shown..again the 30 to one ratio Kill Bill style!

They don't merely copy the formula of the first film. They expand. They go bigger. This movie is a whole different beast altogether. It's a full on crime story this time. That being said, there is loads more action here as well. The movie is a lot longer than the first film as it is two and a half hours long, I believe. I enjoyed that first film but this one is even better. For starters, the movie on a production level looks absolutely spectacular. The cinematography and art direction is terrific. I marveled at how beautiful this movie looks almost as much as I did the fight choreography, and perhaps more. But while we're on the subject of the fight choreography, it's possibly the best I've ever seen in a movie. It's crazy how these folks can make violence look beautiful with the physicality shown in their movements, even as they're tearing each other apart, lol. Artistically, I just greatly commend the effort that they put in. And I also just appreciate how well edited and directed everything is. They don't cut everything too fast. The camera is not still because they have to move but you can still see what's going on. I enjoyed all the performances as well. Gareth Evans, you are the man. I'm not totally sure if you need to have seen the first film to enjoy this one, but I recommend that you do for the simple fact that that movie was also awesome. Plus it would make an off-the-chain double feature with this one. One of the best martial arts films ever made in my opinion.",

The End. The film is essentially one long combat sequence.The sequel - again, an Indonesian movie written and directed by Welshman Gareth Edwards - is a much more complex affair. Running for two and a half hours, the first section takes place in prison following which our hero falls in on operational duties with the son of a crime family in a plot in which various factions do things to try to elicit certain courses of action from various other factions, sometimes quite confusingly - there is an element of \"who is that, and why are they trying to kill him?\" from time to time.It is still full of combat, however, although as someone who is not a huge fan of martial arts movies, I found the law of diminishing returns started to set in. Also I wondered at how often combatants continued fighting after getting smashed in the head with a baseball bat or similar. Or why guns were used readily during the car chase, but not during some of the hand to hand stuff. And I really would have liked a payoff whereby the undercover cop finally got to be reunited with the son he hadn't seen since he was an infant only two years ago.",

As for the Martial Arts, these were also a disappointment. Fight scenes way to long and drawn out and made unrealistic by the level of violence and injury that didn't seem to affect the main characters at all. As for that funny little guy who took on two others, sorry he wasn't in the least bit convincing. The main reason this didn't work though was the main character had zero personality. What made the early martial Arts films work, especially Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan was that the main character had personality and you found yourself routing for them.

Fights are blazing, choreographed with such precision that each death-inducing blow produces an impact across the cinema. Gareth Evans conducts a cinematic plays stringed by excessive bloodbath, his visions might be over-the-top, but they will leave both fans of the action genre and casual audience cringe breathlessly.The prequel had some poor unintentionally funny dialogues, even more so if one understood Indonesian. For this movie, the script has been polished and scenes are constructed more consistently. Granted, it's still troubled by some setbacks of usual action movies', but there are more engaging and personal lines to be had. Acting is improved with the addition of Arifin Putra as Uco, the son of mafia boss who is eager to prove himself. The character is ruthless in his actions and also passionately fueled by ambition and greed, Arifin Putra portrays it well with a hint of doubt or maybe even guilt.Alex Abbad as Bejo is quite harrowing despite his disability. There's a disturbing untrustworthy feel surrounding the character, the fact that he has legion of assassins make him more treacherous. This army of assassins almost seemingly pops out of some Japanese anime, akin to what inspired Kill Bill's or Matrix's. Among them there are not many that stands out in acting department, what makes them memorable are their choice of weapons and the body count they pile with them. A visually impaired girl swinging double hammers in a subway, that's gold.Iko Uwais as the leading protagonist performs respectably. He's a man with good ideology and equal ill fate; it's easy to sympathize for his cause. He has done a good job playing a difficult role, but his strength lies in the action sequences. To say that the battles are brutal is an understatement; these warriors unleash pure mayhem on each other. Every broken bones and limbs are executed with much gusto, blood sprayed from all angles, this may very well be the most brutal thing one can see on cinema.Cinematography is splendid, it's apparent that Gareth Evans was motivated by many Hollywood movies. Scenes are slick, utilizing different camera angles for best view of the action and often time follow it in continuous shot. The cameras seem almost glued to the characters as they rush and rip each other apart, yet they will pan or zoom out just in the right moment for the audience to appreciate the intricacy of the movie's complex action choreography. Its particular car chase scene takes the viewer swirling through the vehicles astoundingly; it's the best chase scene since The Matrix Reloaded.The Raid 2: Berandal has refined plot from the prequel and in terms of sheer action carnage none can rival it.",

There was no story in it, but a game style of presentation which focused mainly on stunts and I had seen better than that. For a sequel to that, I mean this movie was no chance to complain about in any level. The story, stunts, performances, direction all were top notch and easily can surpass to grab the title for 'this year's best martial art/stunt movie'. I had no expectations before a watch and after a watch got so excited for having it.After completing somewhat a successful rescue mission that took place in a tenement run by a ruthless gangster, now Rama is assigned to a new undercover operation. Temporarily says goodbye to his regular life and to his wife. To get in a position it takes months of hard work and he successfully makes into one of the members of the gang that he's after. Soon the ideas vary like to initiate new techniques to rule the underworld makes crack within the mob family. So the clash happens randomly to take over the top position from one another. In between the cop's role and the final stand brings the result to this story with plenty of awesome stunt sequences.Worth to spend our time for this 150 minute long movie, especially if you are the greatest fan of the mixed martial arts then you got a solid reason to go for this. For every 10-15 minutes there is one stunt sequence, all I can say is it was very well patterned in a decent story. Yes, the story was not a brand new, it was what we have already seen many times in the Japanese Yakuza, Hollywood, European et cetera undercover cop stories. But to see the new cast from the new region of the earth's surface it was fantastic. I have not seen many Indonesian movies, so probably this could be the best movies from there to the international standards. This country should take cues from this movie to make consistent from now on like what Tony Jaa's movies did for Thai movies. ''We may be after the same thing... ...But I'm not going to follow the path as you to get there.''Regarding the undercover cop theme, the lead character Rama was not the superior, but individually, many characters had produced incredible equality by exhibiting breathtaking stunt skills. Truly to say Rama vanishes in between all these guys. He's used only for the opening and the end portions, that's it. So that means this movie is beyond his presence that will definitely surprise the viewers. The gore was very strong, focused too deep details like ripping skin, breaking bones, smashing heads, hammering. Definitely there is going to be another sequel and my expectations rose high for that. There should be no 'I missed it' or 'not seen yet' in the mouths of movie fanatics because it is a must see.",

I liked the way that the storyline continues from the first movie and the new characters were a great addition to the franchise. After watching the bonus material on the DVD, I was astonished to see that this epic movie was made by an English guy. I just hope that he doesn't sell out and start going all Hollywood. Anyway, I don't think that you will ever see action like this in your lifetime and it really does put people like Jackie Chan and Jet Li to shame. A Great Watch!Round-Up: I'm really surprised that this movie didn't make more money because they should have got more money from the Asian audiences. Maybe they didn't like the fact that it wasn't made by an oriental director. Anyway, if you have seen the the movie in this franchise, the main character goes undercover to take down the corrupt cops and crime bosses. After spending 2 years in jail to try and get close to a crime bosses son, he ends up working for the mafia. From there the storyline gets manic because there is internal corruption which he gets involved in. Although the movie is nearly 2 and a half hours long, there is enough action and drama to keep you entertained.\u00a0Budget: $4.5million Worldwide Gross: $6.3millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there epic action movies about a cop who goes undercover to take down corrupt cops and mafia bosses. 8/10",

Normally I wouldn't go and see a movie like this but I am in the Philippines and my wife and I had time on our hands and the tickets were 141 pesos (why the extra one (its 2 cents) when it causes a hassle every time?) Not complaining though because its great value. So we went to see it. Well folks The Raid 2 turns out to be an excellent movie. In Hollywood movies there is usually what I call the gun solution. Everything is resolved with a gun. Either he should have had a gun; he should have been better prepared by having drawn the gun earlier; or she was vulnerable because she did not have gun; or if only he had a gun he could have defended himself; or why didn't he have a gun? Or the other person had a bigger gun, a faster gun, a prettier gun. And so on. Has it occurred to any body in America (pro-gun or anti- gun) that this is incredibly predictable, repetitive and tedious? I am saying this to contrast the absurd plethora of guns in USA movies with this Indonesian movie. Sure there are guns and too much shooting as in most movies but it wasn't the solution to every last problem. It was obviously fantastical but the conflicts were martial arts centred instead of based around the much lazier gun conflicts. To act in this movie you had to be an athlete. Most of our western Hollywood stars don't have to be this fit. Although I hate weapons and violence and despite the surreal fantastical nature of the fights, I found them gripping. I could not take my eyes off the fights whereas usually martial arts bores the hell out of me. These were done so well I was galvanised. Partly this was due to the very professional sense of tension in the screenplay. Someone in Indonesia knows how to get your attention and how to keep it. The main character was very charismatic and likable and all the characters were very convincing. The twists were real twists and quite unexpected. There are elements of Tarantino in this movie and I had to turn away from a couple of scenes. The sociopaths are convincing and the writer obviously knows his/her stuff about sociopathy. The prison scenes were refreshingly third world instead of the usual American jails of course. I would never have thought I would go to see a martial arts movie, let alone say it was excellent. But I did go to see it. I was gripped by it. I was never bored. I admired the acting and the screenplay and now I am assessing it as superlative. Life sometimes gives you what you least expect",

Now three years later, Evans goes for the jugular again with The Raid 2: Berandal, a sequel that knows what a sequel should be \u2013 bigger and better than the original. The Raid 2 picks up where the original left off. Police officer Rama (Iko Uwais) fought his way out of a building teeming with fight-to-the- death bad guys. But any attempt to go back to a normal life is thwarted when gangsters threaten the safety of his wife and child. Rama's defence will come in the form of an undercover assignment that will have our hero infiltrate the criminal underworld which reveals corruption at all levels of the felonious enterprise. Rama then fights and fights again and then fights some more in countless outnumbered battles choreographed to perfection. At a whopping two-and- a-half-hours, The Raid 2 has plenty of blood, sweat, kicks and punches to do last us the remainder of the action film release year. It is an exhausting punch to the face that will have audiences cheering at the conclusion of each action sequence. Watching Iko Uwais find the energy to kick, punch and stab his way through a virtual army of bad guys will have you embarrassed of the notion that Jackie Chan was still recently considered one of the best at his craft. What Rama faces in the first 45 minutes would have killed two Chan's and makes Jackie's films feel like a made-for-television After School Special. The Raid 2's buffet of violence uses every obtainable weapon available to the combatants. Knives, hammers, guns, fists\u0085if you can grab it, swing it, shoot it or throw it, it's a tool for your survival. Evans clearly knows how to film great action whether in large rooms or in the backseat of a car. He is relentless in his presentation you can't help but marvel over the preparation that was undertaken to pull off such a masterful stroke. The Raid 2 is everything we wanted it to be. And more.

Like many Indonesian counterparts its brutally violent and bloody. By no means, a film for everyone, even those who like wall to wall action.The pacing of this film is frenetic and the choreography amazing. The fight scenes mix very pratical street combat with larger than life spectacle in a variety of environments, each with the own benefits and limitations. Layers of opponents attack, offering the opportunity for some very creative use of hand and foot, wrestling and weapons, conventional and unconventional.Indeed, its the experimentally brutal and eviscerally cruel fight scenes that define this film but that's not to say, its all that defines it. Acting is solid and the back story whilst predictable is done convincingly. Cinamatogrpahy is also top shelf and its accompanied by occasional but appropriate, sound tracks.All in all a real winner \"if\" you can stomach the violence which even had me wincing at times.8/10.",

            "review_title": "Overbloated sequel that would've been more effective if edited down by 15-20 minutes",
            "content": "To start off this review, I want to say that I'm a huge fan of the first movie and I think The Raid 1 is one of the best action movies ever made. What the first Raid movie got right was the simplicity and elegance of focusing on one thing and making sure it is done right. Every action sequence in The Raid 1 is fresh, clever, and generally unexpected in some way or another that consistently juggles the audience's expectations as to what is going to happen next during a fight. Pretty much every technique and trick in the book is used in the Raid 1.The Raid 1 is the Mad Max: Fury Road of martial arts films.The Raid 2 is the Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome of martial arts films.I am genuinely surprised at how much love The Raid 2 gets when it is a severely flawed and jumbled mess of a film that has a handful of interesting action sequences that rarely ever reach the same levels of artistry as what the first film had. Bigger doesn't mean better, and while there are really cool set-pieces with a lot of stuff going on, the tension in those scenes is a lot lower due to the fact that 90% of the violence is happening to characters we don't know or care about.It's just violence for the sake of violence.Let me give an in-movie example: There is a fairly well known \"fight\" sequence that shows two assassins brutally murdering killing dozens of men to get to their targets. One is a girl with two hammers who cartoonishly slaughters a bunch of men in a dragged out incredibly violent action sequence and another is a guy with a baseball bat who brutally beats people to death. This scene takes up roughly 5-10 minutes of the movie and adds NOTHING to the movie and actually hinders the pacing and progression of the film while also decreasing the tension of the film. It does the direct opposite of its supposed intention, that being an attempt at raising the stakes by showing the villains our protagonist will have to kill. However, by giving them a pointless action sequence, all other violence in the movie looks tame in comparison and once the protagonist fights these characters, his fight with them IS SHORTER than their introduction.All the movie needed to do was show Hammer girl enter the train full of people. Cut to the next train stop. Show the girl exiting the train with her hammers and give the audience a peek into the train car full of dead bodies. It would take only 30 seconds to pull off and would give the audience a morbid curiosity and apprehension at who this deadly assassin is without ruining the pacing of the film.Less is more.There is also a very strange issue in this movie where an actor who played a major role in the first movie shows up in this film to play a completely different character, but it is never thoroughly explained or referenced that they are a different character because the character was never named in the first film. When watching the film, I was scratching my head as to whether or not this was supposed to be a new character or not. Regardless of who they are supposed to be, their character ALSO adds nothing to the core plot of the movie and it could've easily have been any other character who filled their role.Yet another character who is given multiple action sequences when none of them add to the narrative.Now, this next criticism might seem odd, but I genuinely think this movie is too violent for its own good. Usually, movies tend to scale the violence based off of how close the movie is to the end of the film, but this movie randomly spikes in violence every 10-15 seconds, making all of the action scenes feel too similar in intensity and ferocity. Violence needs to be used intentionally and in the first movie every bit of \"extreme violence or gore\" was always used to great effect by deliberately usurping the audience's expectations. A great example would be the \"door kill\" from the first movie where no one ever expects it to happen, but when it happens the audience always shouts out in terror or goes \"OH SHOOT! I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT!!!\". The Raid 2 doesn't have any moments like that because it is CONSTANTLY trying to outdo the violence in the first movie.The only real redeeming aspects of this movie are whenever the protagonist does something... which is RARE. The vast majority of the film's run time is focused on other characters running around and creating drama while everyone's Rama sits in the sidelines until the third act. Fortunately, the final action sequence of this film is REALLY well done and quite entertaining but it's a shame that it takes over 2 hours to get to it.After having written this review, I think it quite apparent to me that pacing is by far this movie's greatest issue. Whether it be pacing in violence, character introductions, scene length, or excessive dialogue scenes, this movie quite clearly has major pacing issues that should've been addressed in the editing room. If 15-20 minutes of this movie were removed, I think it would be a much more interesting and engaging product.If one has ever read Roger Ebert's review of The Raid 1, he infamously gave it a 1 star review, saying that the movie was overly violent, appealed only to the reptilian brain, and was essentially exploiting violence for no artistic value. I strongly disagree with that criticism of The Raid 1... however, all of those criticism can be applied to The Raid 2.",

            "review_title": "A great action movie worth seeing indeed",
            "content": "I'd use the full title here, The Raid 2: Barandal, The word 'berandal' is Indonesian meaning somewhere between punks and thugs, usually of younger age. The full title sounds better with Indonesian word on it.A bit of trivia though, the first movie was to be released titled the same but using Indonesian words \"Serbuan Maut\". It's true that each of those words hold a dark and intimidating meaning, as 'serbu' (the base verb, means assaulting in numbers, 'serbuan' is the derived noun) and 'maut' means deadly ('maut' is the base noun, meaning death, and in the phrase it is used as an adjective). But thank heavens they didn't go with it because \"Serbuan Maut\" sounds soooooooo gay, particularly due to so many \"fake\" Indonesian horror movies, self-defined horror genre movie with not scary whatsoever ghosts and a lot of selling womanly body parts which are able to pass censorship, that use those kinds of lame Indonesian titles.The story picks up right after the end of the first movie. Rama meets Bunawar, the man his brother Andi refers him to. Bunawar recruits Rama to go undercover to tie Reza, the corrupt politician mentioned in the first movie, with the local gangsters, Jakarta's own Bangun and the Japanese Goto-gumi. Rama then gets arrested to infiltrate the prison and earn the trust of Uco, Bangun's son. Rama succeeded and two years later Uco brings him to meet Bangun. Bangun takes Rama into his wing, particularly to watch over Uco, specifically because Bangun is paranoia even to his own son.Bangun turn out to be true. Uco, who is impatient for power transfer from his father, comes to a rising local new gang boss Bejo and make deal with him to start a war between the Bangun gang and Goto-gumi. They whacked Prakoso, a Bangun family loyal muscle-man, and try to frame the deed to the Gotos. The act failed as Bangun claimed responsibility and agree to pay the Gotos compensation. Seeing his plans don't work, Uco keeps on running his scheme with Bejo, ultimately killing his own father while Rama and Eka, Bangn's right hand who turn out to be another undercover cop, run for their lives. Eka doesn't survive his wounds and Rama goes back to confront Uco, Bejo and Reza. Rama fights his way through Uco's and Bejo's men, and through Hammer Girl, Baseball Bat Man, and The Assassin, and finally able to defeat, and kill Uco.There are a few notes from me about the movie. It's disappointing that Andi must have his \"walk to sunset\" moment so early in the sequel. Bunawar is depicted alternating between 'lu' and 'kamu' when addressing to 'you' and alternating between 'gua' and 'saya' when he is addressing himself. This is strange since no Indonesian do this.The Indonesian prison is being depicted so cool, but soooo wrong. It's wrong that for example just last year a class II prison in Jogjakarta let some army soldiers march right in and butchered a man who killed their commander.And I cracked my self up seeing Epi Kusnandar in the movie, and as an underground porn production man, and wielding a Gloc G18, a machine pistol that is so rarely used, let alone in Indonesia. Also the snow depicted in Jakarta make me laugh hard since here we can only dream of seeing it first hand.The fights are great action sequences. The moves are now more fluid and straight to the point compared to the first movie. Although there are still unnecessary moves performed by the actors that may confuse viewers on why they do them. Unfortunately this movie shows lack of good editing on terms of appropriate scene speed on the body-throws on fight scenes. The throws look far slower than the rest of the fights.Since the success of the movie, it looks like it's easier to enlist top names for the cast. I see top Indonesian actors and actresses, junior and senior lining up even for smaller, one-scene roles. Thus the acting is great. It's good that Iko Uwais can manage to balance the acting of seniors like Julie Estelle, Arifin Putra and Tio Pakusadewo.Arifin Putra is able to showcase his talents here. After we in Indonesia saw his \"stupid boy\" role performances years ago, now he nailed the \"psychotic\" role well. Also Julie Estelle manages well to get out of the shell of the teen drama girl slash horror main female roles. Although a role with no dialog seems to undermine her full acting capability.The costumes, makeup, set are done well in this second installment. Particularly the blood splatters are done well, just the right amount and directed logically. Although It's a bit nagging that Hammer Girl doesn't get to keep her skirt up to when she fights Rama. The feminine side is shown great through the wearing of the skirt on the train fight scene.What I regret from the movie is that there are many scenes that contributes greatly to develop the characters, but do not contribute well to the entire saga, due to the characters involved dies out quickly at the end, leaving no room for relevance in the next installment.Overall, From me it's a 7 out of 19 score, and a definite recommendation to see. It's a great action movie, and I see look forward for \"The Raid 3\".",

If The Raid hasn't changed your mind, this one will.This is best seen uncut and subbed. Never watch a foreign movie with English dub.I really loved The Raid despite the lack of plot & dialogue. I couldn't imagine how Gareth Evans could up the ante and make an equally engaging action movie. Now, obviously trying for complexity & character development, Evans serves us, not only a platter, but a buffet of interesting characters, unending action & gore, and a storyline that's bigger than a dilapidated building with cramped hallways. It may take several minutes into the film to be able to memorize all those names (especially if you're also trying to recall the names in the first film) but hey you know what? It doesn't matter. The minute the action starts, every little detail in your mind melts as you witness an insane amount of bone-crunching, blood-spurting, throat-gashing, jaw-breaking, ball-breaking, hammer-gouging scenes for more than two hours. While that amount of time may usually be a weakness to typical action flicks as they may need some time to cool down, Berandal just keeps on going and going and going with the same intensity as when it started - that is if not more.Iko Uwais as Rama is better than ever, and the new cast is absolutely charming in a gory way. I've read that Berandal was supposed to be a stand alone film but Evans decided to connect The Raid with it to make it a part of the trilogy. Well it shows, because there are times when Rama just disappears from the story and the film focuses on Uco (Arifin Putra), Bejo (Alex Abbad) and their \"family\" issues, which sometimes makes Rama a supporting character, and not the major driving force to the film's plot. And as much as I love Mad Dog, his sudden appearance seems out of place. It's like he was put there just because he played a vital and unforgettable role in the first film, and even though his scenes were relevant to Berandal's plot, it just felt forced.I also felt that sometimes the hand-to-hand combat was a bit repetitive but maybe that's me being sleepy & tired. My favorite is Hammer Girl and I would have wanted more scenes with her smashing and puncturing skulls & bones. Even if they seemed a bit too \"graphic novel\", being there more for style than anything else, she & baseball bat man are scene stealers. I just wonder how kick ass they would be if their enemies have guns. Then again we have to suspend our disbelief (as usual) since guns were rarely used in here.Still, The Raid 2 is in my list of best action films of all time - The Raid still a notch higher in my book though.READ MORE OF MY REVIES ON BLOGGER: http://strangereview.blogspot.com/#sthash.k9wDSUgJ.dpuf",

            "content": "I really enjoyed the first Raid film because of its simplicity. It was billed as a High octane action movie and thats what we got, relentless action. There was little plot with the action taking the wheel, which I loved.The second film however tried too hard to create a plot and diluted the action to the point where The Raid 2 can feel lime a bit of a slog and a chore at times. I feared this would be the case going in due to the 2h30 runtime and I was right. The plot just wasn't that engaging or intriguing. None of the characters were particularly interesting, and the dialogue felt quite cliche and lethargic.However, I didn't watch this film wanting or expecting a brilliant plot, I came to watch the action and I was not disappointed on that front. There are some terrific set pieces, culminating in a eye wateringly brutal final fight which is the highlight of the film. I was never expecting the action to be the problem with this film and it wasn't. 10/10 in that respect.As mentioned the only issue is that we get about the same amount of action, probably less in fact, than the first film, but the runtime is 50 minutes longer. The result is bad pacing and some scenes that border on being boring.Still a decent movie and worth watching if you liked the first and enjoy action films.",

Heads-up you poser LOSERS: this is an action flick. Not a \"fiiilm,\" not a drama, not a character study, not Shakespeare. A MARTIAL ARTS ACTION FLICK, you know, those movies that are for...martial arts action flick fans, perhaps? Therefore, accepting and understanding this movie for what it is, I give it a 10 because the action is off the hizook boi!! The 10 of course is strictly for the action, because, as is usually the case with such movies, the story line and plot isn't the best, but as far as action flicks are concerned, it isn't bad. It has some of the best fight choreography I have seen in ages, and probably THE best car chase/gun battle I have ever seen, as far as I can remember, except perhaps for Mad Max, which was epic. The final battle is edge of your seat material, and there's no high-wire or GCI bullshit. There are also no generic PG13 garbage fights for audiences of all ages, thank god! This one is for the grown-ups folks, so, when somebody gets blasted in the head by a shotgun, it looks like what it's supposed to look like.A piece of advice: It's pretty simple, if this kind of movie isn't for you, then stay away from the genre, simple as that. However, if you're going to review a movie, review the movie you saw, for what it is--not the movie you didn't see, just to go around feeling superior.To the martial arts action-flick fans: Go see this, grab a bucket of popcorn, and get ready for a wild ride.

            "content": "Is ultra-violence cool? Is seeing someone's head bashed in awesome? Don't get me wrong: I don't shy away from these movies. Given the right tone, I think violence can be funny (Kill Bill). Or in the context of an engrossing story it can be quite stunning (The Chaser). I'll try to think of a more serious-toned and prototypically-genre film I love. Another Korean thriller: I Saw the Devil. That movie has some fantastically violent scenes. But it's tense, engaging, and an interesting exploration of the 'revenge' theme.Maybe The Raid 2 was going for something like that - they certainly dedicate enough screen-time to telling the story - but it's uninteresting and over-complicated in its execution, and I've no doubt the film's appeal to fans is almost solely in its action scenes. But it's not fun like other martial arts films that put action above story, nor is it trying to be. Judging from its relentless violence, and propensity for having its humourless characters wearing pimpin' shades, the conclusion I've drawn about the filmmakers' philosophy: the more violent, the cooler the movie will be. But I don't find it cool so much as tiring.I was not a big fan of the first 'Raid', but I thought, given the additional freedom of this film (it's no longer confined to one location), they could do a lot more with it. And they sorta did; there are some pretty impressive sequences and far more colourful visuals - it isn't bad - but it's still hampered by the same dour tone as the original.",

            "content": "Double bill time, Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans has made a big splash with his action one-two punch which puts the Indonesian martial art \"Pencak Silat\" on a bigger map. Swimming against the tide of an inexorably digitized world, since the noughties, action movies have been experiencing a somewhat fundamentalistic revolution ushered in by ONG-BAK: THE THAI WARRIOR (2003), where a more tactile, point-blank and lethal combat style greatly relying on the performers' physical prowess sounding the death knell for a plethora of CGI-heavy schlock, and Gareth Evans takes the revolution further down that road, at any time of the day, it is more than welcomingBlanketed in its slate blue hue, THE RAID: REDEMPTION has a setting like a single-location entrapment horror flick, a catastrophic heavy blow incurs to a team of elite squad when they raid inside a tenement tower block owned by the crime lord Tama Riyado (Sahetapy) in Jakarta's slums, it turns out to be a set-up as a corollary of corruption among police top-brass. Assailed by not zombies but practically zombie-looking inhabitants (bedraggled drug addicts mostly) and a cohort of Tama's henchmen, they might find some painful irony (if they are still breathing) from recollecting the paradoxical pep talk of Sergeant Jaka (Taslim), who is leading the raid, paraphrasing here: it is a highly dangerous mission, but I don't want to see any of those seats empty when we return. The one who is bestowed with a protagonist nimbus is Rama (Uwais), a tyro in the forces and has an ax to grind in the game, when all the ammo is expended, his killer martial art skill starts to tip the scale in the bloodshed. Since its no-account story-line seldom fluctuates with plot development (barring a fraternal reunion), and although many tropes of suspense routinely deployed to the hilt, it is the action pieces taking our breath away, the go-for-the-jugular (joints, limbs, and other more cardinal parts) pragmatism and Evans' lenience on blood and guts, skewered together one set piece after another, our rapt attention becomes a given, and the brutal aesthetics reaches its crescendo in the close-range combat between Rama, his brother Andi (Alamsyah) and Tama's top muscle, a disheveled Mad Dog (Ruhian, who is a martial art virtuoso and the fight choreographer for both movies, also plays a completely different character in the sequel). After REDEMPTION successfully testing the water, THE RAID 2: BERANDAL (which means thug in Indonesian) is expectedly souped up by a significantly boosted budget and an ampler length (150 minutes, 50 minutes longer than the first installment). Mapping out an ambitious gangster turf war saga, Evans' script swiftly sends Rama to the joint to befriend Uco (Putra), the son of Bangun (Pakusadewo), one of the two kingpins of Jakarta's underworld, where a muddy m\u00eal\u00e8e during a downpour set alight the first frisson of excitement (it is a virtue Evans doesn't overuse the worn- out slo-mo shtick, after THE MATRIX 1999 and its countless emulators, enough is enough). In fact, the resultant story veers more towards Uco's ill-conceived subversion, and Putra, not quite a martial artist himself but commendably takes up the gauntlet as a pompous gilded youth, too thrusting and wanting both wits and patience to mellow into a rightful heir of his father's cosmic empire, particularly when there is nothing to imperil his standing, what is the fuss anyway? Maybe like in every patriarch's incubus, he is just a bad seed and driven at lengths to carry out a patricidal sin, Putra's performance is vehement, visceral and transforms Uco as the film's heart of matter, a grab bag of what is wrong with today's youngsters. In the action section, on the one hand, Evans continues choreographing striking fighting sequences of Pencak Silat, and playing up the possibility of orchestration within a two-by-four space (a prison bathroom, or inside a barreling car); on the other hand, in tandem with an enclosed fistfight, he also cuts his teeth into a sterling car chase set piece with an ace in his sleeve, and what an adrenaline rush it spurs! Although it would be remiss of me to not mention a congenital hiccup rather common in action fares, those conspicuous ready-to-take-the-hit poses or caesuras, mostly from foot soldiers during their fleeting screen-time, it immediately dispels the \"realness\" of all the onerously rehearsed teamwork. The most pyrotechnic eye-catcher is indubitably the final showdown between Rama and the karambit-knives-wielding killer, credited as the Assassin (Rahman), which makes Very Tri Yulisman's Baseball Bat Man and Julie Estelle's Hammer Girl quite bathetic in their gore-fest, not to mention the boss who prefers heavy weaponry but is inept enough to toss it to the wrong one when the crunch comes.Both movies are cracking genre pieces made with labor of love, devotion and dexterity, and Evans' directorial flair takes a crucial peg up under the sequel's grander scale, blissfully, one can see the potential in a filmmaker which can unbridle the genre parameters.",

            "content": "The only thing you need to know about 'The Raid 2: Berandal' is that you need to run to the nearest theater that's playing 'The Raid 2: Berandal' and watch it. This is the sequel to 2011's 'The Raid: Redemption' by Gareth Evans, and is even better than its first literal non-stop hardcore action movie from only a few years ago. This time around, we have a 2.5 hour film full of some of the best action sequences and fight choreography ever put on film. In addition to that, we have one hell of story to go with it, which was mostly lacking from the first film, which I'm not complaining about at all.The story is heavily borrowed from 'Infernal Affairs', or as you might know it as 'The Departed'. And Evans does an exquisite job of mixing the intense fight scenes and story very well, and it never loses its pacing, nor does it go off on a tangent like so many martial arts films have done in the past. If you've been waiting for the ultimate action movie with incredible fight choreography, then you are in luck, for 'The Raid 2: Berandal' is finally here. Now do you have to see the first film to see this sequel? Not necessarily, but it does help set the mood and the character, and also the fact that this sequel takes place only a couple of hours after the first film.After the events of 'The Raid: Redemption', we see our main character Rama (Iko Uwais), physically beaten to hell and is in the care of the head of the undercover bureau of investigations. This man tells Rama that he needs him to go deep undercover to take out a major crime syndicate and must get arrested and go to prison to get in with the son of one of the major crime lords. Rama is told he will only have to spend a few months in prison before he is released, which then we cut to many months later and he is still in prison. This brings us our first incredible fight scene inside a bathroom stall of the prison where it is Rama vs. dozens of prisoners.The second fight scene come in the prison yard during a rain storm between prisoners and guards and lasts about fifteen minutes. It's one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen on the big screen as Evans doesn't use quick cuts like Michael Bay would use, but rather lets his very skilled actors show off their exquisite martial arts skills in a few very long takes. It's bloody, raw, and choreographed to perfection. Once Rama is out, he becomes close to one of the crime lords as he works his way into dealing with over crime syndicates in order to take them down. This is much like Leonardo DiCaprio's character in 'The Departed'.As the film goes on, the crime boss's son Rama works is getting annoyed always playing second fiddle to his father and might conspiring with other gangs, which shows us that each gang is on the brink of complete all out war with Rama in the middle of everything. Through an impressive car chase and a few fight scenes later, we end up at the climax of the film where Rama has to battle 'video game' style a series of henchmen, a few boss battles that consist of a brother and sister team who don a baseball bat and deadly hammers, and one tough older man in a commercial kitchen setting. The results will leave you on the edge of your seat and sweating through your clothes.Evans has made quite the epic masterpiece with this action vehicle that sets the bar very high for future action films. The acting is very good from everybody involved, and Uwais is just put through the ringer physically and emotionally through the entire movie. If you are a fan of action movies in the slightest, please run, don't walk to your nearest theater to see 'The Raid 2: Berandal'!!",

            "content": "The Raid released back in 2011 was an instant classic, the film didn't work within its limitations so much as thrive on them, simple plot, minimal character development, single location and then going for broke with non-stop action scenes that thrilled. It's a risky move by director Gareth Evans to move on from ruthless efficiency and aim to make everything bigger and better with The Raid 2. Fusing its predecessor's action with an off the grid undercover cop deep in the violent underbelly of Jakarta, the result is a rather engrossing crime saga peppered with jaw-dropping action.But walking onto the same hallowed turf as the similar themed The Departed (2005 Oscar Winner) brings a very different sort of comparison to bear than the standard The Raid was judged against. Can it really stake a claim to compete with the best crime dramas of recent years? Of course it can't. But as the sometimes predictable plot twists come and go, families feud and double-cross each other, and the film's hero Rama (Iko Uwais) unsurprisingly finds himself in increasingly tenuous predicaments, it never seems like Evans is over stretching the mark. He knows we've seen the films The Raid 2 emulates and doesn't pretend this is the first time these story arcs and character types have been rolled out. As with his previous film, he pushes this one to its limits \u2013 of acting, pacing, audience buy-in \u2013 without overstepping them. At a paltry cost of $4.5million Hollywood will and should have its jaw on the floor in disbelief at what Evans and his team have accomplished for a mere fraction of today's Hollywood blockbusters ($200M average).As for the action, it's exhilarating. The fight scenes, car chases and bone breaking stunts are integrally intertwined with the narrative to actually drive the story forward to an epic final half hour. Characters called The Assassin, Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man sound like they belong in a comic book world but Evans blends them seamlessly into his vast crime epic to unleash all kinds of fury on our hero Rama. As the film closes in on its 148min runtime we are treated to the most incredibly complex one on one fight scene to ever grace action cinema. This 7 minute showdown is like nothing you have ever seen before and it alone is worth the admission price! However the real victory for Evans is that the crime drama elements that precede each action beat are so engrossing they provide the much needed down time to recover from the spectacular brutality, choreography and cinematography served up. 9/10",

            "content": "Coming off one of the greatest action films ever made, The Raid 2 was facing an uphill battle. Can it possibly top the first Raid? Can it capture the pure intensity and thrill that was Raid: Redemption? The Raid 2 is a very different film, but still has the high octane ridiculous action that everyone loved from the first film.This time around there's more of a story behind all this action instead of people just fighting for a few hours. Which don't get me wrong is exactly what made the first one so special, but story to go along with it helps. But my gripe with this movie is that truly we don't really care about the mob battle that's going on. We just wanted to follow Iko Uwais on another insane mission. The film is almost an hour longer than the first entry, and it doesn't need to be. There are certain films that we go to see for one reason and one reason only. For The Raid 2 we watch it for the action that no other film can even come close to displaying. Unfortunately it just gives us a little too much exposition at times.But my god the action far surpassed what the first film did. Particularly the mud scene and the ending kitchen fight. The mud scene had long shots of going in between different fights and it was just incredible directing. And the kitchen scene is one of the best choreographed fight scenes in history. I cant even think of one that beats it. As far as where the third entry may go? It doesn't matter for me, as long as there plenty more action sequences similar to those two and you will have me in the theater. I don't know how I feel about the North American remake. I don't know that you can capture that same sort of uniqueness. Nevertheless The Raid 2 is another great entry to the action genre.+Evan's superb directing +Kitchen scene... enough said +Making the unbelievable believable +Uwais is a star -Adding it all this story is perhaps unnecessary -Runtime should be cut down 8.2/10",

            "content": "There is some deliberate Meta referencing at the beginning of The Raid 2: Berandal when a gangster speaks about ambition and limitations. Coincidentally, these are the two most defining characteristics of modern cinema. A film limited by its scope and budget can occasionally defy its modest ambitions to become as popular as some of the more fancied mainstream Hollywood productions. The Raid: Redemption (2011) was a small hit from an unlikely source. Welsh director Gareth Evans is based in Indonesia and made the martial arts police film locally for only one million dollars. It was about a rookie cop named Rama, played by martial arts tournament finalist Iko Uwais, who cleared a tower block of heavily armed criminals after his squad was ambushed. The film earned a total of nineteen million dollars in revenue and was such a success that Hollywood heavyweights are planning a remake, which might feature the Hemsworth brothers. Yet filmmaking in any country is a greedy and complacent business. Directors are only solidified by being profitable. There is no money in unpopular art. The safest way to build on one success is to repeat and inflate the most successful elements and outperform the previous film. This sequel is subtitled Berandal, which fittingly means \"thug\". Predictably, it's a bigger, more expensive and longer film than its prequel. It is 150 minutes, nearly an hour more, and cost four million dollars to make. Evans wanted to make Berandal as a prison drama years ago but it was too expensive, so he developed The Raid instead. I didn't enjoy the first film and the sequel is as frustratingly short-sighted. If you are as easily bored by fight scenes as I am, particularly when the main character is invincible to an insurmountable number of blows, it offers nothing else. Its emphasis on mindless violence entirely overshadows and substitutes the themes and characters in the screenplay. It only proves how complacent Gareth Evans is about anything other than savage fistfights. He knows how to write because he has an M.A. in screen writing from the University of Glamorgan in Wales. Yet after Berandal establishes a small gallery of character who do have complicated motives this time, it retreats tiresomely back towards those action sequences. Though posturing as having a more complex narrative, it is diminutive in its achievements and ultimately limited. Despite having watched the first Raid recently, the opening scenes are very confusing in re-establishing old characters and introducing new ones. The narrative becomes further convoluted when adding in a gang war between the Indonesian and Japanese gangs. It's apparent that Berandal takes too many cues from Infernal Affairs and Martin Scorsese's remake The Departed. Rama must hide himself and protect his family by becoming an undercover cop and infiltrating a crime syndicate to fight police corruption. It's dubious and implausible that despite all the corruption no one recognises Rama or uncovers his new identity. There is admittedly more dialogue and more characters but it's in vain when realising the simplicity of the characterisations. Rama doesn't have a personality. He has a few verbal arguments with his superiors but no reaction to the people he kills, save for a cop caught in the crossfire, and no development. His wife and child feature so little that they don't forge an emotional counterpoint to the fighting. Berandal also thinks it's Shakespearean, resorting to clich\u00e9s about aspirational gangsters climbing the criminal ladder. In prison Rama befriends Ucok (Arifin Putra), the son of a crime boss, who is threatening to rise up against his own father. Being a violent, misogynist animal, he doesn't elicit sympathy. Other characters are ridiculous cartoons, like Prakoso who looks like a hobo and kills for money to pay for child welfare, or are sketches including a killer simply named Hammer Girl. She has a friend who murderers people with a baseball. The simplicity of the script is typified by Gareth Evans' adolescent work behind the camera. He simply loves violence too much. There are apparently nineteen different set pieces in the film. They occupy broader spaces than the original's claustrophobic confines. Each one is rhythmically predictable and similar: the characters prepare for a standoff in slow-motion and then engage in some of the most gratuitous, barbaric violence I've seen in years. People are punched, kicked, beaten, shot, bludgeoned, stabbed, run over and cut up with hammers. The frequency of the set pieces, particularly in the last hour where the story and themes are completely discarded, is monotonous in pacing and light on tension. The fights might look brutal and physical but we know they are choreographed because Rama rarely takes any damage. He shows no strains right after tending to a cut on his arm. The series' most adamant fans will argue that realism doesn't matter in a martial arts film. If it's not meant to be realistic then why does Evans insist on making the violence as graphic as possible? Using hand-held cameras and unbroken tracking shots, he scans meticulously over every single blow and snapped bone. Some people at the screening cheered and winced through the whole movie and others laughed loudly, which I'm ashamed to admit made me laugh a bit too. It was a result of how over the top the film is rather than a sense of enjoyment. Not everyone is as enthusiastic about violence as this sadistic and purposeless series.",

Claimed the best action movies ever, I struggle to see what makes them worthy outside of the intricacy of the stunts, which isn't necessarily anything new. The first is okay. A gritty claustrophobic labyrinth that offers little tension and investment. Admittedly, I've never been a fan of martial arts films, outside of The Matrix's adoption of kung fu, although all the friends of my adolescence adored them. I don't really get a kick out of it. The Raid 2 certainly deserves to overtake The Raid due to its ambition, scale, and polish in approach, this is what director Gareth Evans set out to do after all. But it's not necessarily operating a better level, at least not until its more coherent and tense final stretch and modestly executed ending.Otherwise it's shamelessly clich\u00e9 ridden, from its themes and premise to every tick in its action. I couldn't follow any of the story and frankly each scene could have been a new set of characters and it wouldn't have made a difference to me. The dialogue is either painfully on the nose or irritatingly vague. Side actors keep mugging at the camera. I can see how that doesn't matter to people because the adrenaline pumping action sequences do boast the effort put into the choreography. It's certainly shot a lot better than the first. It's brutal with the violence, gratuitously head on. but again, I don't get a kick out of it, never have. The only major compliment I have to offer is that the cinematography is incredible, especially the impossible shots. Unfortunately it's such a chore to get through and it took several sittings.

            "content": "One of the most anticipated movies of 2014 for me, The Raid 2 is perfect action movie mayhem. It's a sequel to The Raid, and this time has Rama going undercover into the mob to shut it down for good. The Raid, while fairly delicious action movie mayhem, was essentially a 1 hour and 40 minute action scene with little story and excessive violence. Although I was excited about this, I had doubts about it since it would likely once again be too violent and had a length of 2 hours and 30 minutes. Luckily, the film delivered on the promise of its premise and blew nearly every other action film of the 2010s out of the water. It isn't for everyone and those who don't like action films should stay far away. Like with the first one it's so violent that at times it can just feel a bit nasty and 2 and a half hours is just indulgent. There was also a feeling of the action scenes not developing and expanding with each one, so at times it felt somewhat samey. But who cares? Watching The Raid 2 is like getting punched in the face by Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is a painfully intense, relentlessly hard hitting and utterly mind blowing out of control thrill ride that doesn't pause for breath. The action scenes are brilliantly directed, impeccably choreographed and are totally devoid of CGI and special effects stupidity. It is also an interesting storyline and it follows the sequel formula with great skill. The direction is second to none. Gareth Evans is the next John Woo and I can't wait for his next film. At times feeling like a Tarrantino film, at others a Kubrick one, The Raid 2 is a ground breaking, jaw dropping action masterpiece powering through the TV screen. It's too long and too violent, but while most action films are CGI ridden, clich\u00e9d affairs this one keeps you guessing and emphasizes what action is all about. With white knuckle thrills galore, this will entertain many and although it's not compelling on an emotional level, it does come up with a good story. Some may find it indulgent and noisy, but the fact is there simply isn't anything else like it.9/10",

Started well: solid setup and background and the plot development seemed to be going well: devious, efficient criminals, cops in a predicament. Looked like we had a decent, gritty, realistic cop-drama on our hands. Then it all fell apart. First the plot started developing holes. Things started to seem contrived and implausible, and I kept thinking \"But surely they should do (that)\" and \"How is that possible?\".Worst of all, it suddenly became a martial arts movie. You know, the silly, over-the-top, very unrealistic, impossible-moves, impeccably- choreographed stuff. It started with one cop vs about 10 bad guys (and the cop winning of course), and then seemed to happen every chance the director got. It got to be so excessive, I was laughing (hey, maybe it was meant to be a comedy...). Not only were the fight scenes gratuitously plentiful, silly and contrived, each scene went on and on and on - they seemed interminable. I started fast forwarding through them after a while.By now the plot had left town, as the fight scenes were there to carry the movie, leaving the movie an empty shell.The Raid 2 is better than the first one, but not by too much. Plot is better, and stays decent until almost the end. Much grittier and more plausible than the first one. Almost Scorsese-esque in its grittiness and twistiness - reminded me of The Departed and Goodfellas.Plot wasn't perfect though - a bit jumbled in the beginning and there are moments towards the end where things don't totally add up, but the plot-holes weren't major.So, just when you're hoping this is is going to be a serious crime- drama, unlike The Raid with its comical fight scenes, the laughable fight scenes start up again. Sporadically at first, then gathering in frequency until the last few scenes of the movie just lurch from one outrageous fight scene to the next. As in The Raid, each fight seems to go on forever, and the best thing one can do is fast- forward through them.So, while for about the first half of the movie it looked like it was going to be more serious than The Raid, it ends pretty much the same as it. It's due to being grittier for longer that The Raid 2 is better than The Raid.",

The sole survivors of the original go to a \"good cop\" pleading for help and he accepts, with a hitch. They have to help him bring down some of the more corrupt people in the city. With in a short amount of time they infiltrate a very exclusive gang of sorts and proceed on bringing them down from the inside. One thing that seems to be an unspoken rule of sequels is for them to be bigger, louder, and (oddly) longer. Clocking at two and a half hours, 'The Raid 2' is an entire hour longer than its predecessor. But the question is, is it better? The answer is no. While it certainly does a lot of great things, and improves on things from the original, there are more negatives to this one. But we'll get into that later. The major plus here is, like the original, the action. And with a two and a half hour run time, there is no shortage of it.It takes what the original did so well and tosses in unique weapons that define characters. There are baseball bats, hammers, hooks, and even cars all used as close range weapons. And it was incredibly cool. The choreography is bigger and better than the original, which allowed the film to up the ante even more.Not only are there a variety of different weapons used, there is also tons of different sets that define certain sequences. Car chases, train fights, kitchen fights, shoot outs, this movie quite literally has everything that you could ever want out of the action. Not to mention the cinematography.Which, like the action, is leagues better than the first. Each shoot was very well composed, lit, and in focus. It employed many wide shots and close ups that helped elevate scenes to their dramatic fullest. It was clean, sharp, and compelling to watch. These are all very welcomed improvements on the original and make for a much more interesting and fun watch.But it's story is less than interesting. Not only is it very familiar in nature but it's fairly convenient too. What I mean by this is that, there are many many moments where things kind of just appeared or happened. A character would be in trouble and suddenly a gun would appear and he'd make it out.Other times characters just kind of did things with out rhyme or reason. But the worst mistake this movie makes is benching its main character. The coolest action star in years basically rides the bench until the last thirty minutes. He either does absolutely nothing or just flat out isn't in the movie.There are a couple of long stretches where I was left wondering how the main character was handling what was going on. Because he just isn't there. When it finally comes back on screen he seems to not really be there. He says a couple things than sits back and does nothing. It was hard to get into the story without someone taking the journey with you. Him, like us, are new to this world but he seems to not care about anything that is going on.So why should we? His fights at the end are probably the best fight scenes I have seen in any movie ever, but everything was so muddled up until that point. The main character is virtually non existent and things to just sort of, happen. It makes 'The Raid 2' feel long, uneven, and even boring at times. Thank goodness that this has some of the coolest action ever or this would hardly be worth recommending.",

Then by the time the hero is done with one person, the people running towards the hero still haven't reached him all at once, but instead just one person reaches him.The last couple of fight scenes are more interesting when the hero takes on the bad guy's guard dogs. Yet, the hero gets so injured it makes no sense how he could withstand fighting anymore as he progresses to each one. There is actually one fight scene in the movie where the hero fights a guy for like 30 seconds and only a few hits knocks the hero out. This is the most realistic fight scene in the movie!

I'm a little less in love with 'The Raid 2' - when it's good, it's very good, but it stalls a little bit too much to be a classic. Still, it is a very entertaining watch for action and martial arts junkies.The good bits: the fight scenes and action set pieces are majorly ramped up from the first film. More than likely, this is what most of us came to this film for and they do not disappoint. The fight choreography is great, and the sights, sounds and overall feeling of impact during the action is amazing. The camera whirs around at a frenetic pace in places which may be a deal breaker for some, but it suits the action perfectly. There is also some impressive technical shenanigans going on for some of the close quarters stuff. In fact, the film looks brilliant overall: vibrant and stylish in places, gritty and decaying in others but always nice to look at.The not-so-good bit: for me, the story didn't fit so well within the film. There were just too many strands to the narrative and consequently this killed the pacing for me. I can see what director/writer Gareth Evans was going for but I think there were just too many ideas for one film - it was begging for a shorter, sharper narrative. The police corruption and international underworld crime elements seemed more suited to a Kang Woo-suk, Johnnie To or Martin Scorsese film than here. Having said that, I would be interested to see Evans tackle something in this vein in the future as there is an inkling here that he could handle such a story.Overall, 'The Raid 2' was a little bit less than what I was hoping for but not to the point of disappointment and I still had a good time. If you enjoyed 'The Raid' you will enjoy 'The Raid 2' - it's bigger and louder than its predecessor which both helps and hinders it as an action film.",

            "content": "The Raid 2 \u2013 Berandal is a story of legacy, of what it means to be a man, of achieving greatness, and how much blood is spilt in extravagant and utterly disgusting ways in the meantime. It exists in a world where misanthropy is king, and where blood might as well ooze from every spark plug, sewer grate, and bathroom tap. To The Raid 2, the only way to become \"someone,\" as its characters discover (or not), is to kill absolutely everyone you come across with an array of awful weapons. Sometimes it's a machete, sometimes it's a broomstick, sometimes it's a man's fist pulverizing a goon's face into concrete, but in the end one thing is for sure: plastic surgery will boom, because there's a hell of a lot of facial deconstruction, whether someone's jaw is snapped off, or their face is ground to a pulp on a rough concrete wall. To The Raid 2, there is no friend, no ally, just a video game pile-on of ultra-violence as men charge to their dooms in a single file fashion \u2014 how polite, I thought, queuing for your reserved seat in Hell like you're waiting in line at the deli. Take your ticket, sir, it won't be long until you're the one on the menu.This morally reprehensible movie has its fair share of terrible and one dimensional characters, all of which should be a pile of bone dust from how much blunt-force trauma their uber-muscular square-jawed figures absorb. There are no female characters, no, unless you count an utterly useless wife figure of Disturbed Sociopath #1, a man who is so far up the sociopath scale that I doubt he ever loved in the first place. The first appearance of a breathing human female, excluding the useless wife, is a topless lady wearing a strap-on. The second is two 'skanks' who are paid to sing karaoke and sexually gratify Disturbed Sociopath #1 and Disturbed Sociopath #2. They don't get that far, obviously, because God knows Disturbed Sociopath #1 and #2 yearn for their fix of beating someone's face into the earth, so they're promptly disposed of after a thorough shake-up.If you consider this review cynical, you're only half-way down the rabbit hole. I'd say it's \"a taste of its own medicine,\" but The Raid 2 is a misanthropic, all-hating, violent beat-'em-up with no point besides that of one of its hyper-sharpened blade. Its cynicism cannot be rivalled by that of a particularly shaken and disturbed critic, like yours truly, who wished he had never stumbled across this abhorrent slice of awful. Just once, during this drunken brawl of masochism and ultra-masculinity, I wanted a character to open its mouth, scream, and run away from its ever-impending road trip through the depths of oblivion. I suppose some got half way there, opening their mouths to utter a guttural scream of \"Oh bother, why didn't I get a proper education,\" but it's only a millisecond before a sharp or blunt instrument pulverizes their face like a sledgehammer to an eggshell.It's a critics job to either decide the artistic merit of a film or gauge its quality of entertainment. So often we come across popcorn flicks, like the critically damned Transformers series, who are excused from the dinner table of the cinematic medium for being 'intentionally stupid'. The Raid 2 is not stupid. It shouldn't be excused. It is a popcorn flick. It exists to serve a plate of morally stagnant violence and martial arts choreography to its viewers like a plate of undercooked seafood. Sure, it might taste alright, but it's only a matter of hours before the horrid food-poisoning sets in, leaving you with a churning stomach and a raging temperature. Violence, when cooked to perfection, is a powerful medium. It can speak words of revenge, of love, of hate, of ambition and power. The Raid 2 speaks no intelligible words with its punches, just a garbled \"Blaghhh\" as it presents an audience of teenage boys something to practice not-flinching too. Because, you know, girls love a hardened and violent guy.It melds the Bruce Li kung-fu epic with the violence and moral confusion of Oldboy, yet its sting is accompanied by no bite. It's flat-faced, unflinching, and faces no consequence. Maybe it's far cleverer than I will ever be, and it's mocking the absurd ultra-violence of this genre, but it's a genre it helped build all on its own. This is no Gremlins 2 or Scream 2, just a movie where every corridor and carpet is coloured blood-red just so the carnage doesn't leave an obvious stain. That, or it used to be another colour. I hate to imagine the possibilities.Berandal, the sequel's subtitle, is an Indonesian word. It means, after quite some research, 'thug' or 'scoundrel' or 'bandit' or 'rascal'. It, unlike the former's (The Raid: Redemption), whose subtitle inferred some form of redemption that never happened, is highly appropriate. The Raid 2 is the kind of thug that would lure you into a shady alleyway to help find his lost puppy, beat the absolute snot out of you, and leave you whining in a puddle of your own blood. After that, he kicks you twice in the stomach and nicks your wallet and car keys. It, just like Disturbed Sociopath #1 through #99, is just an average goon. Today that thief took my proverbial wallet and left me feeling like crap in the shady alleyway of my desk chair. At least I still have my car keys.",

There's a lot more characters in The Raid 2 to The Raid and the film has an excellent cast with excellent acting by Iko Uwais as Rama, Arifin Putra as Uco, Tio Pakusadewo as Bangun, Oka Antara as Eka, Alex Abbad as Bejo and Yayan Ruhian as Prakoso. This film has a lot more Brutal violence, tense action, car chases and excellent fight scenes and this is what makes this film an awesome sequel. The fight scenes in this film are excellent, incredible and very powerful. When I watched The Raid, I loved it and thought it was excellent but The Raid 2 was also awesome but there were only some minor faults to this film. Yayan Ruhian who acted as Prakoso and as Mad Dog in the first film could have been used better in The Raid 2 and there could have been a better fight scene using him. Yayan Ruhian is very strong and has got excellent skills in the Indonesian Martial Art Pencak Silat and if a better fight scene was done making him using his powerful strength and awesome fight moves, It would have been awesome. Although the film The Raid was a bit too violent such as when the character The Hammer Girl used her hammer and strength to attack people on the train, the film The Raid 2 was a big step up from the the first film. Iko Uwais was awesome as Rama and his fights against bad guys in this film was also absolutely brilliant. This film is an awesome film and I do recommend it if you have only seen the first film The Raid.",

            "content": "In the eight years since I became a self-styled analyst of martial arts movies, I have watched and reviewed more karate and kickboxing flicks than many poor people will ever see in their lifetime. In addition to catching up on decades of spin kicks, I have kept fairly current on modern fare, delighting at seeing new innovators from around the world strive for creative leadership of the hand-to-hand action realm. Director Gareth Evans and star Iko Uwais secured that title so soundly in 2011 with their benchmark picture THE RAID that I thought it would be some time before anyone even approached their effort, so imagine my surprise when they not only matched it with the sequel in just a few years, but actually topped it. I had not seen the movie before tonight, and as I write, I am so drained by the high instilled by my experience that this review will probably need to be written in at least two sittings. I used to think I had seen the best of what there is to see, but THE RAID 2 has shattered that notion and humbled me. I've been rocked \u2013 not only by killer action scenes, but by a movie so roundly excellent that, without hyperbole, I am at a loss to imagine how any other martial arts feature will top it.The story: Immediately following the raid on the apartment building, Rama (Uwais) is coerced to go undercover and expose police corruption in the dealings of the fiercest crime conglomerates of Jakarta.Where to start? Well, it might be best to point out the major way THE RAID 2 differs from its predecessor: the complexity of the story. THE RAID was a fairly simple tale whose plot probably took Gareth Evans ten minutes to write out during lunch, but the first thing that the sequel does within its opening minutes is make it clear that its premise is going to be a very intricate business. Deeply layered characterizations, dynamic networks of relationships, and plot-veering twists are the norm of a screenplay so thrilling that the snobs among us will wonder why it was wasted on a \"kung fu movie.\" The answer is, of course, that Evans is demonstrating just how deep his talent for action filmmaking runs. I don't like to fawn too much, but the work that Evans did here is a transcendent, bar-raising effort that catapults him to the top ranks of creative talent in any country's film industry. His penchant for writing intriguing characters is at the cult level \u2013 never failing to nudge them over the top - while his ability to craft suspense through them is Oscar-worthy. Overall, the style of this feature feels more like Coppola than Tarantino, more Christopher Nolan than Prachya Pinkaew, and the film's ability to justifiably take itself more seriously makes for more memorable viewing.The brutal, innovative fight scenes of the first movie set a new standard for what martial arts stars must strive for, and the choreographers of the sequel met their own challenge determinedly. Not only does THE RAID 2 feature about four times as many full-length fights as its predecessor, it does them better. Iko Uwais is an absolute machine of the fighting arts, and he's both complemented and challenged by an exclusive set of fighting costars and a fearless stunt crew. Yayan \"Mad Dog\" Ruhian returns in a juicy fighting role, and he's joined by specialist talents like Cecep Rahman, Julie Estelle, and Very Yulisman \u2013 names which may not mean anything to you now, but who may join your list of favorites if you take the time to identify them. Together, they and many others craft relentlessly furious, inventive, and gory brawls that are bound to contain at least a couple new personal favorites for anyone watching. The long shots and gamely editing highlight more weapons-based brutality than any slasher movie, with Iko & Co. absolutely on fire with creative choreography in a variety of new settings. I was a little disappointed by the deficiency of one-on-one matches \u2013 or anything other than fights wherein one performer takes on at least a half-dozen opponents \u2013 but when these include the choreographic miracle of Iko fighting *fifteen* attackers in a toilet stall, I could forgive it.The length of the movie and the fact that it takes its time building suspense may turn off viewers who like their action flicks a little snappier, but seeing as the action nevertheless comes frequently and in generous portions, I personally had no time to be bored.While the original film was often described as the best martial arts movie ever, I believe the sequel has greater claim to that title. I have seen films whose fight scenes I collectively like better and movies whose story I found more appealing, but when considering the strength of the movie's writing, acting, and production values as a cumulative package in addition its highlighted action content, THE RAID 2 stands above almost all others. Modern Hong Kong fare looks fancy and fragile next to this, Isaac Florentine's work seems ironic, and even Thailand's stars are running to catch up to Gareth and his team. Seagal and Van Damme look like arthritic old dogs in comparison to Uwais and his costars. The movie is a kick in the pants to the film world at large as to how to craft quality thrills, and martial arts fans around the world have ample reason to celebrate. See this.",

Normally sequels suck right? However, this is a sequel that pretty much tops its predecessor in every way. The story is way more complex in this one. It is not simply about a raid like the first one, it's so much more. It envelops more characters and an even more epic Rama performance. At the beginning he is placed in an extremely tough situation but makes the most of it. Cheated, he still continues with his task. And in a way, finishes it. Of course, the movie has tremendous action sequences like never seen before. America, Europe, this is how action movies are supposed to like. Without extreme melodrama, CGI, cars exploding and whatnot. Fight scenes are so well done, it makes me think, how long did it take them to get this right? How long did the director and the stunt director have to think about each and every action sequence. Because all of them have something new in it. It's truly amazing. Music only adds up to the movie, which is always a good thing. The characters have quite a bit more depth than the ones in the 1st movie. Story is more complex, fight scenes are even better, crazier but realistic in most parts. Tremendous movie, easy 10/10",

Now, after seeing the Raid 2 (three times actually), I can say that this sequel is just like 'Empire Strikes Back' since we go deeper into this Gareth's alternate universe of Jakarta's underground world with bigger scope, more impressive characters, more action, not only martial arts but also car chase, prison riot etc. So two thumb ups for Gareth and team.My only complain about this movie, the story is a bit choppy, it feels like there are some scenes removed, which I don't see the point since this 150 mins movies flies so fast so additional 30 mins extra scene is still reasonable, combine with removing unnecessary plot (ie Prakoso's story).The prison riot, the baseball bat man's fight, the car chase ad especially the final fight are making this movies worth watching several times. And definitely has raising the bar quite high, even I can't enjoy those full CGI movies anymore. Feels too much artificial.And just like Empire Strikes Back to Star Wars, it is a great sequel and meet my expectation in any way possible. However, there are something on the 1st movies which stands out. I can't describe it well, but the 1st movies somehow feels more raw, genuine, a true masterpiece of modern martial art cinema.Sorry for my broken English.",

Sometimes confused, always derivative and oddly amateurish.But I didn't see this film for its Oscar potential. This is cinema that delivers such brilliantly choreographed relentless beats I almost needed an interval just to catch my breathe. Even some of the minor henchmen could leave the Avengers begging for mercy before breaking them anyway.This is now getting closer to a hot genre. And this in itself is exciting. Yes its Indonesian, there is a name attached to the specific fighting style but really that isn't the deal. Yes, it obviously borrows heavily from martial arts movies of yore, but so much is discarded. These fights are desperate, not languid. There is no thread of honour here, just a journey in and out of the sewer. There are no sweeping mountain scenes - much of the fighting is insanely claustrophobic. Nobody is one with nature.As if to question the very validity of Kill Bill, a girl with two claw hammers is as psychotic as the image suggests but remains somehow fragile. Guns are not taboo, they are simply a slightly anachronistic tool. It borrows from Hong Kong crime thrillers at points but it is not a bullet ballet.The film is gorged with names and characters, crime lords and henchmen - there is a semblance of a plot, but the focus is the current situation. I missed a few connections due not having seen the first film. The feel is more Korean in style than (say) Beat Takashi productions where you have almost no characters to remember. Many of the scenes hang together oddly, as if the fight scenes have pummelled the sense out of them. But there is enough to make do.At one point the hero almost seems to be telling his boss to stop messing with the script, so he can continue with the beats.

Do you watch war movies and complain \"no a-bombs\"? Too long? Why can't a movie be 150 minutes or even 230 or 500 minutes if it's good? Because too much over-stimulation has lowered our attention span? Then here's a good way to train it again(or the great \"Love Exposure\").Some complained that the story didn't make sense, that the first part had better fight scenes, etc...Naturally, the first part had to rely more on fight scenes, since they didn't have the budget for many locations or a bigger story. Here, we still get to see a lot of(creative) fight scenes, but we also get to see a car chase, some shootings, betrayal...For me, the only \"complaints\" are the snow scene(as beautiful as it is, it might as well snow in hell, it's Jakarta!) and...I think that's about it. And it's beautiful to watch, so it's not really a problem for me. Another small issue for me are the subtitles...my Indonesian is far from fluent, but I noticed that most of the time, the translation is far from what they're actually saying. Sometimes, it's just minor differences, but some differences are pretty big. For example, Uco refers to his father as \"Sir\"/\"pa\"(short for \"bapak\"). Now, \"pak\" or \"pa\" is indeed how you usually refer to older males in Indonesia(cab drivers, street vendors). But why would a son refer to his father as sir? But again, these are small things and especially the subtitles are not the directors fault, nor the actors.On the plus side, we have a real story this time. And it isn't just some cookie-cutter story line, but it's a pretty good one too! It has twists, it is exciting, it has interesting characters(and develops them). We get to see how Uco can't handle to stand in his father's shadow and how it eats him up inside...we can see how, despite being on the other side of the law(which he upheld so much in part 1), Rama realizes that the world isn't just black and white, good or bad...and that even among the \"bad\" guys, there are some who are really bad and some who may have strayed(Eka). Also, as someone who loves Indonesia and who's been to Jakarta countless times, I really love to see a movie in which we actually get to see this great city. It's a really nice change of venue and I wish a lot more movies would be shot in cities like this...it can be romantic(Thamrin at night, the underpass at Jl. Blora), it can be spooky and creepy(North Jakarta, parts of Grogol, East Jkt), it can be commercial(this city has probably 150 malls or more). Sure, it is unrealistically empty(anyone who's been to Jakarta will know that any street is basically NEVER empty, no matter how late at night or early in the day) and the car chase seems to be done, circling around the CBD only(which makes sense though, as Jakarta suffers from huge traffic issues and it would be a lot easier to stop traffic there than in any of the major roads). But at least it gives people an idea what this city looks like and might allow for more people to visit it.I hope that we'll get to see more good movies from Indonesia in the future, even with Gareth Evans having left the country. Before him, most of the movies they made were shallow soap opera-like romantic comedies or dramas, all of which not very appealing to non- Indonesians(and even many Indonesians, according to my friends). It's an underestimated country and I'd be happy to see it receive more international fame.",

            "content": "I gotta say this movie sort of reminded me of the video game \"Sleeping Dogs\"...And it's freaking awesome. The first \"The Raid\" movie is a straightforward entertaining action movie that is so darn well crafted. This is not a rehash, but a movie that goes in a new direction with a grander scale while still carrying familiar essences. In another words, this film brings about elements that makes it a great sequel. This time around it tries to carry through with a in depth story, now this could be a hit or a miss for a movie such as this. Fortunately it works for the most part and it's a enticing, exhilarating and adrenaline filled ride. Sure, some parts seemed slightly drawn out, but that is only a very small gripe when it comes to the total package. Gareth Evans is a director that knows how to make entertaining movies. In a interview Evans claims to make movies that he wants to see, like I stated in my previous review of \"The Raid\". And he knows what he wants to see in a sequel and I gotta say, I like the man's taste in movies and sequels. He brings about a sequel that shows how a sequel can evolve from the previous movie, kind of like \"Batman Begins\" to \"The Dark Knight\". The camera work when it comes to the action and fight sequences is so darn immersive, exciting and entertaining. There is clarity in these sequences without taking away from the suspense. In another words you can actually see exactly what is going on in the action sequences without those choppy, super close up, shaky cam, too many cuts sequences that is overly used in a lot of modern Hollywood movies these days...Which in my opinion takes away from the choreography sometimes. And the fight choreography in this is top notch and I could watch it multiple times. Even the chase scene in this movie is just spectacular and is ranked as one of the best chase scenes in my book. I have seen a lot of movies with crazy car maneuvers, but this has a lot of innovative and creative aspects to the chase scene. I could watch the chase scene in this movie multiple times over watching a chase scene that lacks creativity and has bunch of destruction and cars piling up on each other like in \"A Good Day to Die Hard\". The director Gareth Evans even played a major part in writing the script for this movie. Sure, I could tell he borrowed certain elements from other movies of this sort. But Gareth Evans knows how to emulate those movies into his own ORIGINAL script with those borrowed ideas. My only complaint when it came to the characters is that some of the villains didn't seem fleshed out enough. Like for the Baseball Bat Man and Hammer Girl, because they seemed like interesting characters. However Evans did the best he could to fit a lot of materials in within the 2 hours and 30 minute mark. Which is actually pretty long for a martial arts movie, but it mostly all works out in the end. Evans even decided to cut out the gang war scene which took up quite a bit of time and budget in order to keep up with the pacing of this movie. And there just wasn't a moment where I felt bored while sitting through it all. There are parts that seemed a bit far-fetched, but for a film like this it doesn't really matter and it doesn't go overboard. Even the soundtracks fits the sequences and the pacing and is cool to listen to. If you are a audience member that likes mobster or martial arts movies, this one is worth checking out...It might not be for audiences with weak stomachs though. Overall \"The Raid 2\" is simply what a sequel should be. Oh and the final fight part reminded me of \"The Man from Nowhere\" except it's 10 times better. Bravo! Gareth Evans, you keep evolving with your directing with each installment in your films. I am highly looking forward to your next project.9/10",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRama (Iko Uwais), the hero cop from the first film, returns. Witnessing police corruption whilst trying to bring a crooked cop down, he finds the only way to stay on the good side of his colleagues is to take an assignment undercover in prison, to get the lowdown on what's happening with the son of crime lord Bangun (Tio Pakusode) who's inside. When the mission is over, he finds himself taken in by the crime lord, who's facing threats from power hungry younger rivals. He then finds himself caught up in a vicious, bloody battle for power that will take more casualties than you might imagine.The original Raid film transcended the boundaries of foreign cinema, crossing over in to the mainstream and developing a cult following on the Atlantic. In an age where practically anyone can be an action star with the aid of wires and CGI, fans of the genre were still blown away by the silat fighting antics of lead star Kuwais and his natural, lightning fast, breathtaking ability. And so Welsh director Gareth Evans has returned with his bankable lead star and produced something on a far grander, more dynamic scale, in both scope and length, that seems designed to cater to fans everywhere. Whereas before the lightning speed and flexibility of Kuwais seemed enough to blow the fans away, here Evans and Kuwais respectively seem to be aiming to blow the viewer's mind by way of shock value too, with the fighting taking on a bloodier, more gory angle, with the hero proving more frenziedly psychopathic than many of the villains he's killing, chopping and slicing them in a manner that needs to be seen to be believed, with an end showdown that simply leaves the viewer stunned. Most of the action is martial arts based, and so the consistency is kept up for the full quota. Although it's still a foreign production, it still has a more polished, sleek look than it's predecessor, in line with the rule of law to sequels to films people didn't think would do that well. It's a worry that Hollywood would try and do it's own remake of it, but this looks perfectly like a mainstream film in it's own right. For something this large scale, it wouldn't have been unthinkable to have some kind of deeper, social message to it. As it is, it plays more like a Godfather 2 style study of family and the depths power can drive people to, which it manages fairly well and it doesn't feel out of place at all.For it's lengthy running time, the film is still consistently exciting and breathtaking. In spite of it's scope, it never feels over ambitious. Drawing from the success of the first film, the director and star team have learned lessons as well as being dazzled by their success and combined to make something pretty damn special. ****",

            "content": "It's an exhilarating feeling that cannot be put into words when something you've been anticipating for a long time manages to exceed all your sky-high expectations with effortless ease & leaves you in a euphoric state of pure bliss in the end. And something exactly like that happened this year when director Gareth Evans finally unleashed his follow-up sequel to The Raid (also known as The Raid: Redemption) which in itself is the best action film to come out in recent memory.Taking place 2 hours after the events of the first film, The Raid 2 continues the quest of Rama as he goes undercover to enter the criminal underworld in order to weed out more corrupt cops & politicians. The story then jumps 2 years ahead where we see him making a steady rise through the hierarchy of Jakarta's most powerful crime syndicate. But when the peace between the underworlds of Indonesia & Japan is disturbed by a new player in town, it sets in motion a chain of events that forces Rama to take them all out once & for all.Gareth Evans could've easily chosen the same route that worked so well in the original but it's good to see that he has greater ambitions plus the talent required to pull it off as The Raid 2 presents him ingeniously expanding on the premise of the first film, adding the complexity of mob flicks into its plot & taking the benchmark action of its predecessor to a whole new level. And even though he falls little short of making the drama work in perfect harmony with the mind-blowing action, he nonetheless cements his status as the best action filmmaker working today.Coming to the technical aspects, the production design moves away from the inhospitable look of the last film & comes up with set pieces that offer a wide range of diversity this time around. Cinematography shows a significant improvement over its predecessor & makes excellent use of the camera angles, focus shots, unbroken single takes or wide-angle captures in closed spaces. The action scenes are expertly edited however I can't say the same about its drama. And the music, although slightly inferior to the original, works very well for the most part & is absolutely perfect where it mattered most.And now, the performances. Compared to the handful of characters present in the last chapter, The Raid 2 features a huge list of diverse characters this time played by an equally interesting cast. Reprising his role of Rama, Iko Uwais has come a long way from the baby-faced Yuda he was in Merantau to the ass-kicking Yuda (the alias Rama uses in the underworld) he plays in this chapter. Although he's still improving on the dramatic portion of his character but when it comes to action, he's in an entirely different league & impresses greatly with his charismatic screen presence.Yayan Ruhian, who left a huge impression as Mad Dog in the last chapter, also returns but in an entirely different role this time. He plays Prakoso; the most loyal & dedicated assassin of Jakarta's most feared mob boss, Bangun. Arifin Putra plays Bangun's son who's desperate for more power. Alex Abbad plays Bejo; a self-made gangster with an arsenal of assassins ready to die for him. And it's his top-tier henchmen, namely Hammer Girl, Baseball Bat Man & The Assassin, who make up for the film's most notable characters & are absolutely show-stealing in their given screen time.Another thing that I just love about The Raid 2 is that despite having a production budget of a mere $4.5 million, the jaw-dropping cinematic experience it provides is far more satisfying than the combined input of all big-budget Hollywood action flicks released in the last decade. And that in itself is a big \"fuck you\" note to Hollywood which hasn't given a solid action entertainer in ages. As far as the action is concerned, each segment is better than the one preceding it & eventually culminates with total massacre splattered all over the screen.Gareth Evans is the real master here as every battle scene is his design & the action choreographers have done a fabulous job in bringing his ideas to life. In the end, fans will always be divided over which is a superior film amongst the two but there's less denying that both are supreme examples of its genre. The smooth manner in which all its aspects blend together & work in perfect harmony during its final hour alone makes it an instant classic and for the roller- coaster ride of emotions it provides throughout its runtime, it deserves to be ranked amongst world cinema's finest sequels.On an overall scale, The Raid 2 is an extremely ambitious sequel by Gareth Evans which dares to dream beyond its realms and delivers a cinematic experience so unique & extraordinary that it will remain unchallenged for the next few years, at least. Thanks to its outstanding direction, deft writing, brilliant production design, splendid photography, immaculate editing, dynamic score, sincere performances & genre-defining action sequences, it's one hell of an adrenaline- pumping, heart-pounding, jaw-dropping & ass-kicking cinema that's smeared with blood & isn't for the easily distressed.In a sentence, The Raid 2 is to The Raid what The Godfather Part II was to The Godfather, what The Empire Strikes Back was to A New Hope, what Aliens was to Alien, what Terminator 2 was to The Terminator & what The Dark Knight was to Batman Begins. It might not be deserving of its 5-star rating for there are noticeable flaws & pacing issues present in the drama but f*ck it. I'm willing to look past that because, in simple words, it got me high unlike any action film before. An insane exercise in endless carnage that's brutal, brilliant & breathtaking at the same time, The Raid 2 is one of the greatest action movies ever made.",

            "content": "Fans like me of the first film regard \"The Raid: Redemption\" as a nonstop action extravaganza. Those fans must be warned that this film does not try to recreate the same tone and pace of the first film. Although this is a sequel, it in many ways bears little resemblance to the heart-pounding original. What Gareth Evans is trying to accomplish is a larger scope ensemble piece that diminishes the screen time of our main protagonist. The pacing is deliberately slow to find nuance in moments of confrontation or other plot revelation. This also lengthens many scenes of plot development that work their way through. There are betrayals, ambushes, and many scenes of stewing tension. Many many scenes. Evans also edited this film, and this is certainly a director's cut at 150 minutes. It seems this is Evan's \"Godfather\" with a 'Fredo' character. I would not fault much with the pacing in general for an ambitious long unfolding saga, but the audience must be prepared for the film to take it's time in the telling of the story.Perhaps Evans overreached in his effort to make an epic masterpiece. I felt that things were getting too drawn out in all the supporting characters subplots. It also made one yearn for another action scene to arrive quicker, as the dialogue scenes seemed to drag, especially near the end. I think if Evans let himself be a little more ruthless in condensing the drama in order to find a more energetic tone like the first film, it would feel a little more solid. Having allowed for the director's ambitions, he certainly shows depth in staging character drama and eliciting good performances from his actors. As for the action scenes, they certainly up the ante, and would remind you of the kinetic fighting sequences that made the \"Bourne\" films so exciting. There are many well choreographed large fight sequences that do an excellent job of moving the camera around to capture the cacophony. Some select shots venture into graphic novel territory, with large Tarantino-Esque fonts and dramatic angles. However, these shots are few and far between, instead finding mostly nervous hand-held shots supplying the bulk of the cinematography.I also enjoyed the element of surprise as it was hard to know what to expect next as the layers of characters do their next dirty deed. I just wish Evans didn't push things in the drama to the length of near exhaustion as everyone eventually gets their due. When I compare epic gangster films like \"Goodfellas\", \"The Godfather\", \"Scarface\", with all of them clocking in over 2 1/2 hours, they have better pacing than this film. So unfortunately it is hard to recommend this as an action film, but would find it engaging for someone willing to immerse themselves in a story of corruption and rival gangsters looking for betrayal and revenge. The extreme violence the first film was known for is evident here, but does not break much new ground. There is an innovative sequence with a lady wielding two sharp claw hammers, but didn't wow me. The other moments of shock come from a bad guy getting his head blown off on screen, and perhaps another bad guy eating a baseball bat. So our protagonist seems to have superpowers as he rises to the level of your typical indestructible hero that audiences have grown accustom to in typical action films.I will give this film a 6. Despite being overlong and over-ambitious, it is still done with enough skill and style to rise above most low budget mobster films.",

            "content": "After reading all the reviews on this film I came to ask one question. Before I ask the question i just want to say that most reviews were dead on giving this film a 10 out of 10. I know that reviews are opinion not fact. However this film was absolutely INCREDIBLE. The 1st film was amazing and set a new standard for martial art films and action films. It set the bar really high. It had great acting and a really good plot too. Then comes the sequel and literally blows IMO of course the 1st film out of the water in EVERY single aspect. This movie had a great, plot great acting, but the choreography & stunt work was absolutely on a league of it's own. I have never seen in any action or martial arts film with the level of incredible stunt work and just brutal fighting in any other film. Most martial arts films (I've seen A BUNCH BTW) have great choreography and stunt work yet there imo is something always missing like a decent plot or it's campy. This has none of those. Also most leave out a lot of the absolute brutality. A fair warning this is probably the most brutal fighting film I've seen.So back to my question almost every reviewer gave it 10 out 10. I'm just wondering for those who didn't. What isn't perfect about this sequel? What does it take to impress you? Could you do better? There isn't imo another action film like this at all. Again I've seen a lot. I try to avoid the cheesy films. Yet I can't believe these people have seen a better martial arts film or action film. I would like to know what the name of it is. So I can see for myself. There is no down side if you like the first and if you like violent martial arts films with gangster mafia style movies as well this hits them all. I doubt any of the people who worked on this film will ever read this but if you do Bravo gentlemen. Give yourselves a hand and a pat on the back.As one reviewer said it became his favorite martial arts film ever & I would have to agree. The ending battle ALONE is worth the price of admission it is EPIC. Look at me I'm gushing like I'm schoolgirl. If you haven't seen this film yet and you want to. Stop what you're doing go buy this film don't rent BUY IT. Then show it to all your friends so they can BUY it as well. Standing Ovation on this side folks.",

            "content": "In a cinematic world filled with action films that are all cloned from 'Bourne' movies, i.e. where our hero is mercilessly pursued across one city after the next by relentless government agents, it's actually quite nice to see a change of style (and in a sequel, no less!).The original 'Raid' film was quite a condensed little piece, set in Indonesia it was about a police raid that went bad, leaving only a handful of survivors left alive. Part II starts only a matter of hours after the first one ends and the only honest cop left alive finds he's still in hot water when a secret team of police officers recruit him to go undercover and infiltrate what's left of the gangs who run the city's crime.Now the 'raid' is really a raid in name only. There's no raid in the sequel, just a story which revolves around our downtrodden police hero and his attempts to infiltrate those he has sworn to destroy. It does \u2013 naturally \u2013 have subtitles, so you'll need to be okay with reading them while you're watching.Strangely enough, for an action film, there's quite a bit to it. It's quite a long film \u2013 over two hours \u2013 and some might say that that is too long to just watch multiple martial arts scenes (did I mention you really need to be a fan of martial arts movies to appreciate this?). However, it never really outstays its welcome and actually moves pretty quickly.In fact\u0085 our hero almost becomes forgotten as a fair amount of the story is dedicated to the gang members and how they're attempting to doublecross each other. Some of the enemies almost become even more memorable than our hero, who almost starts to seem bland in comparison.Perhaps one of the Raid 2's strengths is the way it's filmed. If ever a film has a 'look and feel' then it does here. Every visual is striking and, even if you're not reading the subtitles, each shot is pretty breath-taking.Okay, so you need to truly be into action and/or martial arts movies to fully get the most out of the Raid 2, but anyone who loves film and doesn't mind the subtitles should appreciate the arty overall feel of watching grown men throw each other over toilet cubicles. Oh, yeah\u0085 and it's a little bit violent here and there \u2013 expect the red stuff to flow.",

It was quite simply spectacular, and praise was rightly heaped on it, and its director, Welshman Gareth Evans. He took advantage of the kudos he has earned to massively increase the scale of the sequel, portraying an epic gang war that ensnares other crime organisations from several different countries.The plot is labyrinthine, and can get a bit confusing at times, but that is par for the course in this kind of East Asian crime drama: The Raid 2 gets a great deal of inspiration from Hong Kong's Infernal Affairs, and the work of Japanese director Takashi Miike. It also ladles on the style, delivering an absolute feast of visual flair to accompany the acrobatic flair of the fighters, whose violence seems to have an extra visceral, intensely graphic edge compared to other, more balletic martial arts films.Despite being an athlete before he was ever an actor, star Iko Uwais doesn't disappoint in the greater number of emotional scenes he is called upon to perform. This film won't win him any Oscars, but he still has plenty of time to gain experience and hone his thespian skills, at the end of which I can see him fitting in even in non-action roles.The Raid 2 is not perfect, and certainly considerably more violent than many are comfortable with. In the UK, it has rightly been given an 18 certificate. However, if you are unsure, I urge you to try to overcome your squeamishness. There is a lot to be impressed by here, if you are of a mind to be impressed.For my full review, go to my independent film blog on Blogger, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",

It picks up immediately after the events of the first film and our main character, Rama, is almost instantly thrown right back into the world of crime that he only got a taste of in The Raid.This film excels in almost every way but lets first talk about it's main selling point: the action. The Raid 2 contains, as the title suggests, the absolute greatest action sequences that I have ever seen. Everything is brutally realistic to a point where you start to feel bad for the characters involved, but at the same time you never want the fights to stop. The martial arts choreography is something to behold, and the direction is absolutely stunning. There are very few cuts and every time there is one it is absolutely necessary and enhances the scene rather than detracting from it. The main actor, Iko Uwais, clearly did all his own stunts, which is something that you rarely see and is to be applauded.Speaking of direction and cinematography, even outside of the action this film is absolutely gorgeous. The director, Gareth Evans, has a way of making certain settings feel very real. Clean when appropriate, grimy when appropriate.The acting is great all around. Iko Uwais plays extremely well as Rama and he has a lot more to do in this movie than he did in the last. Arifin Putra does a great job as Uco, the unhinged son of a mob boss, and returning as a different character, Yayan Ruhian is incredible as Prakoso despite his minimal screen time.If I have to choose a flaw with this movie it would be that it is a bit overlong at 150 minutes, whereas the first was a comfortable 101 minutes. Despite this one minor issue I cannot stress enough that this is a must-see for any action junkie. The Raid 2 is truly amazing.The End",

            "content": "Very few films have surprised me when it comes to their sequels, as well as this film has. Some movies in my experience rarely live up to their original precursor films. Studios throw hundreds of millions of dollars to produce massive trilogies that rarely pan out in terms of storyline, and are often bloated massacres (Harry Potter, and that awful Hunger Games series come to mind). However, 'The Raid 2: Redemption' exceeded my expectations at every turn.There have been so many advances in this film, when compared to its first independent and low budget brother. I praised the original for its simplistic, catch-the-bad-guy storyline, but they really focused on telling a much broader and in-depth story this time around, that massively improves upon the first, lending more to the characters and their overall story. If you just look at the run times of both films, the Raid 2 is longer by nearly an hour, and by no means slower in pace. There are certainly better dialogue and delivery this time around, and it actually lends to the original by going further into the lives of the characters in the first film and connecting to the original right away. Every character gets a bit of background and that really adds to the overall experience. The main character, Rama (Iko Uwais), returns to action for a completely believable reason and it doesn't seem forced. The multi-layered and multi-lingual Uco (Arifin Putra), is aggressive, driven, and downright evil at times. His father running his corporate mafia, Bejo the conniving criminal and his influence over others. Even the homeless assassin Prakoso, (Yayan Ruhian who played 'Mad Dog' in the original) has enough storyline to make the viewer actually care about what happens to him as he fights through a sad and violent life. The Raid 2 is a massive improvement just in terms of storytelling alone.Another huge improvement was the advances in action and choreography in the fight scenes throughout Raid 2. I am by no means a martial artist, but I have a lot of respect for those who commit themselves to this kind of art form, and it shows with the sheer number of characters who excel their respective styles. The number of action sequences are frequent, and only broken up by moments that lend to the overall story. The muddy gangland fight notably stands out as one of the best choreographed brawls I've ever seen, and if you focus on the background, ever single fist thrown and kick landed looks real. The debt collection scene has one of the best hallway chase sequences I've ever seen with its twisting and obscure camera angles. One of the hardest sequences in terms of choreography was probably the hallway scene between Rama and the brother / sister duo of 'Baseball-bat boy and Hammer girl' (Very Tri Yulisman and Julie Estelle respectively). The final knife fight sequence in the kitchen shows off the proficiency of one of Uco's henchmen; Eka (played by Oko Antara) and his skill with the Karambit; a curved, cat-claw type of blade. Whereas, the first film mainly focused on Iko Uwais's abilities to stun with his skills in Penak Silat, the Raid 2 really focuses on more than one character's ability to fight. There are several other players that lend to this film's action and it really shows in every scene.Just on a final note, yes this movie is bloody and gory. There is a bit of overkill in that respect, which takes away from some of the action. Most of the violence has a lot of post production FX in terms of the blood you see and it can look a bit silly at times. Of course there has been a growing trend for gore in the action genre (mostly inspired by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez successes), and of course this film is no exception. The blood flies in ridiculous amounts and for me it loses some of its action credit that way.Yet, this is a spectacular sequel in the overall scope and sequence in direction and editing by Gareth Evens, the choreography of the actors themselves, and even the use of 'free to use' licensed music from none other than Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, this movie is bigger and better in so many ways.Do not miss this film.8/10",

            "content": "While reportedly conceptualised before the first 'Raid' movie, this high octane sequel actually feels like a reaction to what some critics did not like about Part One. There is more character development this time round, a more complex story (involving working undercover to take down corrupt police officers) and more dramatic scenes in between all the fights. Gareth Evans does as excellent a job as ever filming all the action, with lengthy unbroken shots as the camera follows characters who are thrown through glass windows and scurry around dilapidated buildings. The film's deflections from the first 'Raid' movie are a mixed blessing though. The antagonists are delightfully less clear cut and the film really lets one get under the skin of its protagonist, played by Iko Uwais. The claustrophobic nature of Part One is sorely missed though and the less frenetic pacing reduces any sense of urgency. Whereas the first film throws a bunch of police officers in a situation where they are unable to escape or retreat and have to fight to survive, there is less sense of a life and death struggle here. 'The Raid 2' does feature some great characters though. At first, it is confusing to have Yayan Ruhian ('Mad Dog' in the first film) pop up as a different character, but it is such a wildly different character that it reflects his acting range. Julie Estelle also makes for an excellent foe, though her screen time is sadly limited. While not the all-time greatest action film that some have hailed it as, 'The Raid 2' is certainly enthralling when at its best and undeniably memorable.",

            "content": "The title might be confusing, but that is precisely what Berendal does. It expands the scope of The Raid yet keeps most of the charm of the first installment.By themselves, both movies are very good, 8+ stars and definitely among the best action movies ever made. They're visceral, brutal and even interactive at times since most viewers might feel their bones creak with some especially nasty blows.Why did i rate this movie a 10? Because it is a proper \"Expansion and continuation\" of the story, making The Raid: Redemption more of a prologue to the main story taking place in Berendal. Going further, Berendal actually gives us the big players who made the story of Redemption actually take place. -Deduction- Tama (Bad guy boss) is basically loosely subordinated or affiliated to at least Reza (Pimp cane guy) and probably a former subordinate of Bangun (Big boss). Reza in turn sent the corrupt cop to raid the apartment building as both a threat and message of payment.\nThis is where our protagonist Rama comes into play - The raid actually succeeded due to his and his brother's actions, but since both the corrupt cop and Tama went down, Reza didn't get what he wanted and started taking out loose ends. Rama's brother gets executed, and Rama himself has no choice but to go undercover for the detective in order to protect his identity and his family.It's pretty much a flawless transition which brings us from an event (the raid) into the big league criminal world.Berendal itself is quite differently executed as compared to Redemption, as it has no sense of constant urgency but focuses much more on world building, character development and personal relations/choices. The action is there for sure, but it comes in big and small chunks with breathing room in between.\nBerendal is almost exhausting to watch, as there is even more brutality and a LOT more injustice taking place as compared to Redemption.All in all, Berendal is a top-notch movie, but it diverges a bit from Redemption with its big open world, fleshed out characters and no sense of urgency. I think it was the proper way to go as it feels like the stakes are raised bigtime.",

Although, now and then, you wonder why an enemy should be approached one by one through a close combat - in the era of firearms... \"Better\" characters are more elaborated than \"bad\" ones, but there are no annoying performances, and all leading roles are well presented (Iko Uwais is better actor than many of his Western counterparts in martial arts).On the whole, witty and stylish, well done again!

            "content": "\"In prison you'd be wise to pick a side. Loners don't tend to last long.\"The anticipated sequel to Gareth Evans' Indonesian film, The Raid, lived up to expectations thanks to some fantastic action scenes and well choreographed fighting scenes (amongst the best I've seen on film). Iko Uwais is back in the lead role as Rama and the film picks up only a few hours after the events of the first movie. If you thought Rama was off the hook after fighting his way out of the building infected with criminals, then you were wrong because this time he has to go undercover and infiltrate the criminal underworld. In order to do so, first he must go to prison and win the confidence of Uco (played by Arifin Putra), the son of one of the most important Indonesian mafia bosses. Evans takes his time setting up the action and although the first hour and a half does contain some entertaining action sequences, it is nothing compared to the final 90 minute of the film. Uwais may not be as convincing as a dramatic actor, but he shines in every action scene he's in. I wasn't sure what direction Evans was going with this film at first, considering it had a rather slow build up, but once he got that out of the way there was plenty of room for fantastic action sequences. Unlike most Hollywood action films, Evans doesn't use so much editing and allows the action to flow uninterruptedly. There was too much shaky cam at times, but the fighting sequences were so well choreographed that it was impossible not to be in awe. My heart is still pumping really fast after those intense action scene, but be warned this film is not for everyone: there is a lot of graphic violence. At times I felt like I was watching a Refn film, less stylized of course but with a heavier narrative story. I was blown away with the second half of this film, but I did find the first half a bit slow and confusing. I only got to watch the dubbed version so that may have affected my overall experience with the dramatic scenes, but the action was perfectly executed.I'm sure there won't be any other movie coming out this year that will top the action sequences in this movie. Evans knows how to deliver action and in the first Raid he was just getting warmed up because in The Raid 2 he delivers plenty of highly choreographed fighting sequences. Uwais is a star, but in this film we also got to meet plenty of other dangerous characters. Yayan Ruhian had played Mad Dog in the first film and he's back for the sequel but as a different character. An odd decision, but it was fun to get to watch this actor once again. The three villains Rama has to face off are also interesting. Of course all we know about them is that they are good fighters (there is no need for character development here). They have no name, but we identify them by their weapon of choice. Baseball Bat Man (Very Tri Yulisman), Hammer Girl (Julie Estelle), and The Assassin (Cecep Arif Rahman) who all prove to be worthy adversaries. The film is two and a half hours long but it is justified because the action scenes are done really well and there are several interesting characters as well. I didn't think I would enjoy this film as much as the first one considering I liked the constraints and tight spaces that the building provided in the original, and although here we have several locations, Evans still manages to direct the action in enclosed spaces such as inside vehicles, hallways, kitchens, and alleys. The film is ultra violent and the martial-arts action is unlike anything you've seen before. It may be too extreme and brutal, but it is great filmmaking nonetheless.",

            "content": "As it stands, I think the Raid films are the best modern action films out right now. Where the first movie felt like one very long fight scene (which wasn't a bad thing), this one went bigger and took its time to create a meaningful story for the characters. With the story I began to realize that this movie's plot had multiple themes. It took its time to touch on issues of gang violence and politics, family, and blind ambition. Some of these themes can make for some really uncomfortable sequences but I believe the actors gave good performances despite what they had to do.The fights are even better here than they were in The Raid: Redemption. One major gripe I had with the first film was that the action would sometimes feel too \"choreographed\". In other words, Rama, the main protagonist, would be fighting his way through a hallway full of goons and he would always know when and how to turn a corner to take down the next guy. In the interest in showing the vulnerability of the hero as well as general realism, extended fight scenes should not always play out to the main guy's favor as he/she should become more reactive than proactive to survive. This, to me, is especially true in cases like this, where our hero is almost always outnumbered. This is something that this movie improves on because there were multiple occasions where I could see how susceptible to fatal wounds Rama really was, despite the main character immunity he may have sometimes. He wasn't necessarily setting the pace for the fights with his fighting expertise, but rather reacting to each and every strike in his (and ours) hopes to survive.The filmmakers for the Raid movies really seem to have a passion for action, which is awesome. Not only do they know how to shoot these sequences well, along with the fact that the actors didn't have stunt doubles, the fights always mean something. Whether its setting the tone for the next part of the story or showing the audience a glimpse of a certain character's true nature, my eyes were glued to the screen for every second of those sequences.The John Wick movies are the only contender to this film and it's predecessor. Asian action films centered around martial arts are always going to beat American ones because that style of action is deeply rooted in the culture. Despite some of the fancy camerawork in The Raid 2 (slowmos and unique angles), the close quarter combat is always the focus when it comes up. The filmmakers didn't rely on music to set the pace or excessive CGI coupled with stunt doubles to depict killing blows. Yes I'm a sucker for good action movies and this is most likely my favorite one yet.",

Then comes the bigger budget..The Raid 2 surpasses its predecessor in every way. The action is better, the tone is better, the cinematography is better, choreography, directing etc Everything was better and, most importantly, the plot was too.There was actually something to cheer for and villains to understand. Things weren't as dictated as the first movie and you are more understanding to its violence and gore as a result.It seems Gareth didn't want to only up the levels from the first film, I also got the sense he wanted to outdo himself as a filmmaker. The way he holds the shots after every climatic moment lets you take in what's just happened fantastically. The uses of mid-shots for most of the fights lets you appreciate what the choreographers have worked so hard to achieve. This film was a piece of art crafted from someone who cares about this genre and understands what he wants to show us. The gore is cut off in extreme moments and left to the imagination in others. There isn't an instance in the film where the gore felt like it was there to be gory, it was more an addition to what was being shown (like how CGI is used to add to the scenes in other films)The additions of some characters (like Hammer Girl) were brutal but brilliant, and this specific character added a nice break from the other uses of female characters in this movie (being nothing other than prostitutes)Overall, it's a brilliant film and builds on the strong foundations of the first.

            "content": "Berandal takes place a few hours of the first Raid film, with Rama now finding himself in a tight situation of consequence for the actions he's caused from the first film, with Dunawar giving him an olive branch of going undercover for him and work his way up in the criminal underworld to get evidence of corrupt politicians and police officials and if he does so, his family will be protected.Rama is put into prison to get close to a fellow inmate, Uco, who happens to be the son of crime boss Bangun, and from there things begin to spiral out of Rama's, now under the identity of Yuda, control and he wonders whether he'll actually be able to get out from his mission.Now I was surprised by the first film when it came out, simple story and premise with a hell of a lot of fight sequences in it. The sequel (which was originally planned as the first film but Evans couldn't get the budget required for it) is ambitious in scope and scale, especially coming with the fight choreography, where as the first film took place in a tower building, this time we go from a prison, to a nightclub, to a car chase/indoor car fight, warehouse to kitchen at a restaurant, I literally can't remember anymore there's just that many throughout this two and a half hour film.The initial fight scene in the prison toilets pretty much sets up for what to expect in this film in terms of the brutality and effect of every punch and kick and the scale of it in comparison to the first. While the first had a basic simple premise, and the film itself being very good, it didn't feel as groundbreaking from what I heard from others as I came to The Raid party late. Here though I can definitely say that I enjoyed the sequel a hell of a lot more mainly due to the bigger scale, the bigger story and most definitely the bigger fight sequences that take place.Iko Uwais has a lot more acting wise to deal with here as Rama coming to grips with being undercover whilst also trying his best in particular moments to not lose sight of the man he is and go beyond the white and black line and does extremely well here, in my opinion. Another actor that comes across well and given the same length of screen time is Arifin Putra as Uco, a son of a crime boss that's doing his best to please his father but yearns for more responsibility. The only bit of casting that could definitely confuse some people is Yayan Ruhian returning to this film but as a different character (he played Mad Dog in the first Raid film) and has a significant role in proceedings. Otherwise the general story was easy enough for me to follow throughout treating me like an idiot and it paced out the talking moments and fight sequences together. A duo that will become iconic, probably one more so than the other is the duo of Hammer Girl and Batboy. Obviously Hammer Girl will be the more popular of the two, still quite possibly the most violent.As for the final fight seen? Think of a as a ballet performance, so well choreographed that it's beautiful to watch, as well as violent, that you won't witness anything like it, maybe never again. Every fight scene you will see from now on will be tame in comparison. of I could live five lifetimes I still won't be able to learn the ability to do half the moves in this film. A stunningly ambitious sequel to the surprise hit The Raid, with terrific action set pieces from the char chase to the choreographed fights, including the final one which will go down as one of the best of all time. Well paced action flick and one can only wonder where Evans goes from here.",

Now with the sequel, what Gareth Evans has done here is expand his own universe (which admittedly was a pretty small universe to begin with) and made an action movie yes, but also a pretty grandiose crime epic. In fact the crime story at hand is so good it would have made a fine film all on its own, but like its predecessor The Raid 2 knows how to play its cards right and balances storytelling with incredible fight scenes. There is absolutely no conceivable way you can criticise the action in this movie, it's just not possible. Every fight scene has been shot, choreographed and edited to perfection. Several scenes in particular near the end of the film are likely to go down in history as the new benchmark for martial arts film-making. I will admit the plot itself and some of the characters had me lost at times, but this was overcome after the halfway point once I understand the characters names and the story retracts into simpler focus. Some characters are so likable and memorable that they don't even need names like Baseball Bat Man and Hammer Girl. I did not care for Bejo however, his crooked teeth, greasy comb-over and limp made him too hammy to be taken seriously. Also two major characters from the first movie reappear way too briefly and I think The Raid 2's biggest missed opportunity was to under use them the way it did. But it's Iko Uwais once again who steals the entire movie, his movement and speed is really the heart of the action, and while a lesser actor might have ruined the legitimacy of the quieter moments, he steals every scene he's in.Because of the presence of a story to make you care about the characters, you stay invested through all the fighting, all the ups and downs our heroes go through we feel it too. Maybe it's too long and maybe there's a few too many fight scenes than necessary but for action fans this is a Must. I will never look as Baseball Bats and Hammers the same way ever again.",

If you are not a total enthusiast you will probably feel dragged.The story is somewhat shallow - and partly irrational. There were a handful of scenes were you would just shake your head. It just didn't make sense. Even if you manage to keep up with the names, most dialogs will seem flimsy or far-fetched. When they started talking about people, who weren't even introduced properly and who were killed off in the next scene anyway, I stopped caring.None of the actors are engaging. While most do a convincing job at the clobbering even the main actors fail to convey the correct emotions. Maybe stony faces and insincere smiles are really the common way the mob interacts, but running over two hours that just doesn't cut it. Anger and grief don't carry a story either, if it's so sudden that it's unconvincing or so clich\u00e9d that you feel annoyed.Overall this movie is a waste of time.",

The story really does well to add more emotion and motive to the characters to keep tensions high, leading to a very thrilling climax.Gareth Evans played his cards well. Though criminally underrated, the Raids 1 and 2 proves that a talented cast, dedicated production crew, and a creative director with a focused vision, trumps that of any major motion picture from Hollywood with big names and a big budget but has a hollow script and sloppy execution.As an interesting aside, it's pretty cool to see the inspiration that the John Wick trilogy takes from The Raid and even have some of the actors from the main cast join the third John Wick film as well.",

What ensues is a non-stop bloodbath with some of the most innovative action scenes ever presented. It is advised to watch the first movie before this one, to remind you of the characters and also to remind you of how f***ing brutal the action is, because it only escalates in the sequel and is not for the squeamish.The performers in this movie are clearly immensely talented, but it's the director who stands out as a genius here. To have the vision to create these sequences is astounding. The way we get these long, tracking shots of multi-stage fight scenes makes me realise how uninspired most recent Hollywood action movies really are. I really hope that someone gives this director a big Hollywood feature to play with, if nothing else so that this quality of action can be brought to a wider audience.Now they could have played white static in between each of the fight scenes and I would have still given this a decent rating, but there's also an engaging plot that makes you care about the characters and makes them much more than just vehicles for the next stunt-filled set piece. The father/son relationship between Uko/Bangun is a great example, a believable relationship which kept me glued to the screen even in the downtime between action.I have very few complaints with this film. I had a little trouble following the plot at times, a lot of characters have very similar names(Eka, Uco, Bejo, Goto) and I struggled to remember what part each of them played in the overall system. I'm aware that this is more a fault of mine than with the movie, but I can't give it a 10/10 without watching it again to fully understand the roles and motivations of each character. I was also a little disappointed when I found out that Mike Shinoda was not doing the score, since that was an aspect of the first movie that really stood out to me as great. The score here is by no means bad though, it does the job very well but is just less noticeable than in the aforementioned original.I had concerns about the 150m runtime but I can safely say that this is not an issue, the time whips by and I'd happily watch another 3hours of this perfectly executed carnage. If you're a fan of the first movie then I can near guarantee you'll love this film. 9/10",

            "content": "Gareth Evans scored in 2011 when his Indonesian action film THE RAID grabbed everyone's attention on the festival circuit, and it earned instant classic status from anyone with an appreciation for on- screen carnage. It was a brutal movie that avoided all of the usual mistakes you'll find in the average Hollywood action film. The plot was paper thin and only really served to keep the action set pieces moving along as the hero battled his way to the end. Evans has returned with a second film continuing the tale of Rama (Iko Uwais), an Indonesian police officer and one of only a handful of survivors from the building raid in the first film. Instead of falling back on the action-heavy formula of the first movie, Evans injects a hearty (if familiar) story into the movie and actually spends an equal amount of time weaving the plot as he does breaking faces. While THE RAID was an exercise in excessive violence and how to do it right, THE RAID 2 adds an element of crime drama. It begins almost immediately after the events of the first movie. Rama is eager to return home to his family but he's approached for a new assignment: an undercover mission where he would infiltrate one of Jakarta's largest criminal organizations to sniff out the corrupt cops who are cooperating with them. Meanwhile there is another\u0085a stone-cold killer named Bejo\u0085who would see the established crime families crumble so that he might rise into position as Indonesia's most powerful.You can tell the success of THE RAID gave Evans enough attention for studios to give the man a budget this time around. For starters, this movie is gorgeous. The first film had limitations. It was all shot within the confines of an apartment building and there weren't a lot of opportunities to get too creative visually. It was dark and gritty. THE RAID 2 is the polar opposite. The filmmakers must've had carte blanche because they make full use of their new expansive budget to give us an array of arresting locations, from a mud-filled prison yard riot to the colorful world of Jakarta's nightlife. With the new possibilities at hand, Evans was able to tell a more complete story. It's nothing we haven't seen before but it's Evans style that makes THE RAID 2 stand out. He brings the same frenetic energy to the table that we've come to expect after his first film. The fights are still fast-paced and the blows land even harder this time around. No matter what problems people might have with Evans as a storyteller, no one should have a negative thing to say on his finesse in staging action scenes. He's outdone himself in the second film with every fight scene more insane than the last. We're even treated to a killer car chase because Evans apparently wasn't content in just rising above his action from THE RAID, he wanted to do it at deadly speeds as well. Just to drive the point home.Rama has got his hands full this time around. He's not just trudging through waves of stoned junkies and hoodlums here. He's got some competition in the form of Bejo's three assassins: the creatively-labeled Hammer Girl, Baseball Bat Man, and\u0085 well\u0085 the Assassin. Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man are pretty self- explanatory. Their gimmicks are in the names, and their fight scenes are nothing short of awesome. Fans of the first film should remember Yayan Ruhian and his character Mad Dog. Yayan's fight scene against Rama and his brother was the big bloody finale in THE RAID, and he returns with a minor role in THE RAID 2. Nothing major. He's just a plot device who pops in for three or four scenes, just long enough to remind us how dangerous a man he can be. Whereas the first movie didn't give Iko Uwais much to work with other than a pregnant wife to come home to as motivation, this movie gives him a little more. Though not much more. Rama is still the hero but this story isn't necessarily his. It's really a story about Uco (Arifin Putra) and his father Bangun (Tio Pakusodewo)\u0085Uco grows tired of living in his father's shadow. He wants more responsibility in the family business but his father doesn't believe him ready, and this leads Uco to drastic measures that could lead to an all-out gang war. Our hero's just along for the ride. It's not something you expect from your protagonist, such a passive role in the film (if you can consider wholesale beat-downs by the bucket-load passive).THE RAID was a great film and served as a showcase for what Gareth Evans was capable of as an action director. THE RAID 2 is a natural progression as he expands his storytelling and ramps up the action to crazy extremes. If you're a fan of action films, you'll love these films and recognize Evans as a director who's career will continue to be worth following.",

No ifs or buts, this is currently THE action standard by which other films need to be judged. The action starts as top-notch and keeps improving as the film progresses.It also has a decent plot although possibly overlong in this respect. We don't expect a classic musical to have the world's best plot, so why an action movie? So many critics fail on this point!The director, Gareth Evans, is going to be seriously big in the industry as are his cohorts Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian who contributed the unbelievably good action sequences.The fact that this was produced for an estimated under $5m is shameful on Hollywood.Watch it, be amazed, get a huge fix of adrenaline, and wonder why Hollywood can't get close to the raw intensity generated by these action scenes.",

            "content": "The latest film by Gareth Evans is the kind of film you'll either love or hate. While the first film in the Raid franchise was succinct and moved along at a breakneck pace, The Raid 2 is slow, building a complex criminal underworld as well as a series of compelling and memorable characters. Clocking in at two and a half hours, martial arts fans will walk out with a smile on their face but that's only because the last twenty minutes are insane. They'll otherwise tell you that it wasn't a very good movie compared to the first as it focused more on things that the Raid: Redemption didn't.The Raid 2 is one of my favorite movies of all time because of that. It combines exceptional, tight storytelling with a great cast, fantastic cinematography, some of the most visceral scenes of martial arts violence ever put to film, and it excels at nearly everything it sets out to do.Following the events of the first film, Rama takes a new name as he is said to have died in the raid on the tenement building. He goes deep undercover to expose the crooks in the police while also gathering evidence against various gang lords. He winds up joining with a local gang who have some internal issues that lead to an eventual gang war and a lot of violence.The plot of the movie is deep and complex, weaving and turning, giving us a variety of characters playing all sorts of roles. Rama is the good guy, but he's focused on a lot less than he was in the first film. This is about scope, something Evans couldn't do with his previous, lower budget films. He's stated that this is, in fact, the film he wanted The Raid to be.While the shaky camera returns in this film to a degree, for the most part the film is gorgeous. The attention to color and aesthetic is intricate and lends beauty to nearly every shot. A lot of thought went into every single photograph taken and that appeals to the film critic in me.The martial arts film critic in me is happy with nearly every fight scene. There are so many brutal moments it's hard to choose a favorite. This movie makes a fight in the backseat of a car brutal and entertaining. And don't get me started on the final battle in the kitchen. It may not be the singularly greatest fight in the history of film, but it's the most visceral. There's a sense of speed, power, and hatred that runs through the final battle and creates something otherworldly. You have to see it for yourself to understand as words can't convey how powerful that final fight is.This film isn't Redemption. It isn't self-contained, it doesn't move at that breakneck pace, it focuses more on story than thrills. But I'll be damned if this isn't one of the greatest crime dramas ever made, as well as one of the finest martial arts films. Most martial arts films hinge on the fighting; very rarely do they have the cinematography or story that makes a movie memorable and inspiring. Okay, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon type films have those, but they don't have the action. Wirework takes me out of the film. The Raid doesn't have that. It's all blow-by-blow action with nothing but CG blood tarnishing the otherwise very real fighting. This is a film that combines everything I love about movies. Action, story, characters, cinematography. It is a movie that, as a film critic, you can love for being a well-made film, and as a martial arts fan for being fantastically choreographed and brutal.",

The films are extremely well shot and very entertaining.",

            "content": "Note: Check me out as the \"Asian Movie Enthusiast\" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) (Indonesian Action).Viewed on March 28th at the Regal E-Walk cinema in the heart of New York City.After surviving the apartment building raid, Iko Uwais goes undercover to take down an Indonesian crime syndicate that is feuding with an invasive Japanese yakuza clan in Jakarta. Things get out of control and everything goes to hell. That's the plot in a nutshell.The fighting is the main draw of this film. Martial arts films are frequently under-appreciated because critics tend to downplay the artistry of orchestrating a fight sequence. In some ways it's like staging a complex dance with extremely difficult performances by physical talents who have spent their entire lives perfecting their craft. In many cases it can be even more challenging than executing a good dramatic moment. With that said, \"The Raid 2\" is an exquisite ballet of death with an incredible variety of expertly crafted action sequences that have a grounded, realistic feel to them. It's hard to describe, but despite the insane action there's very little outrageousness present. The choreography here is some of the best ever put on film.There is no question that Uwais is currently the premiere martial arts star, and there is certainly no question that Gareth Evans is the greatest action director on the planet. This man is a genius in terms of visually expressing action through vivid, mind-blowing camera-work. This guy never directed a car chase sequence in his life, and yet his very first attempt is impressive. I did notice a bit more shaky cam in this film when compared to its predecessor, but one can see everything so it's not a problem. Evans is also a pro to create a crescendo of action where every fight seems to outdo the one before it. This generates an absolutely thrilling final hour that will go down in history.The gory violence of \"The Raid 2\" is a big \"screw you\" to PG-13 action movies. Some critics are already whining about the graphic bloodletting, but these are the same guys who hand out 90% approval ratings to movies with incompetent action and no edge - *cough* \"The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire\" (2013) *cough*. The gore in \"The Raid 2\" isn't just randomly thrown in either. It's a logical consequence of the situation and characters, and it is applied in very creative ways. I have heard that Evans was only coerced to cut a few \"frames\" due to the MPAA review, but I have no idea which frames those were because the now infamous shotgun kill is present in its full, unadulterated glory.The $4.5 million budget is an even bigger \"screw you\" to mega budget Hollywood blockbusters. \"The Raid 2\" has more thrilling action than every $100+ million superhero movie I've ever seen . . . at less than 4.5% of the cost. It's almost unbelievable what these guys can do with a limited budget.Given the exceptional quality of the action, the 148-minute runtime puts some pressure on the story to maintain its momentum between the violence. The first \"Raid\" received much criticism that asserted a generic story and undeveloped characters, but I felt that it nevertheless established a \"feel\" for the characters without the need for long-winded exposition. That \"feel\" can add quite a bit to an action film. \"The Raid 2\" spends more time setting up its premise, which results in some genuine plot and character development. It attempts to do this by taking a generic gangster template and infusing it with a sprawling crime saga that implements many characters. This is essentially a \"chess board\" setup where numerous pieces are first put into place, allowing for many possible confrontations. The viewer is therefore able to relish the moment when a particular piece attacks and takes down another, revealing the actual outcome amidst the countless possibilities.I really liked some of the supporting characters in this, and actually felt a bit sad when they died (even some of the villains!). I am a bit disappointed that both \"Hammer Girl\" and Baseball Bat Man\" are only given a few scenes, but they are certainly memorable. I really liked that brief moment where Hammer Girl picked up her hammers on the bar shelf. It was slightly child-like and innocent, like she was going out to play with friends. This brief, split-second moment can communicate a lot about her character.I suppose it helps to already be a fan of the actors and actresses here, since there are a number of familiar faces from both Indonesian and Japanese film industries. Needless to say, the performances are top notch. The Japanese actors have their little moments, but they could have been given more to do in this. Maybe \"The Raid 3\" will give them more time in the spotlight.Overall, \"The Raid 2\" is a very satisfying action film that justifies its hype after just one viewing. It's simply spectacular.",

The sequel however substitutes the simple premis of the first movie with a rather complicated and incoherent plot punctuated by some of the most gratuatous movie violence I have ever seen. It makes Quentin Tarrantino look like a Disney movie. It was all a bit too much for my taste and because of the tortuous plot it is way overlong at 2 1/2 hours. While it is technically spectacular the fight scenes looked a little too staged and over choreographed, like a ballet of death. Give me John Wick any day.",

            "content": "The sequel to the well-received THE RAID: REDEMPTION, THE RAID 2 is one of the rare sequels that surpasses the original in every department. The story, unlike its predecessor, is grand in size and scope. Instead of being confined to a single location, Iko Uwais' Rama is sent undercover to ferret out corrupt cops who are being paid off by the gangsters who run the city. To do this, he gets sent to prison where he befriends the son of an Indonesian crime lord in order to get close to the family. Once he gets out, the story really takes off and you get an epic tale that recalls elements of THE GODFATHER and THE DEPARTED. You also get even more of the incredible fight scenes and over-the-top violence that made the first one so good. If there's one complaint I have, it's that the movie does bite off a little more than it can chew, though it doesn't lack for ambition. I did like the attempt to give some characters more depth, like Prakoso (Mad Dog, from the first RAID). Still, I would assume that most people come to these types of movies for the martial arts on display, and this one sure doesn't disappoint in that area. There's so many action sequences, I think I lost count and the good thing is that they don't really run together. Each one has a distinct quality or setting or something that sets it apart from the others. The standouts were a prison brawl towards the beginning, one that expertly cuts across three different locations, a riveting car chase and the final fight. The one that cuts across three locations also features two of the most interesting characters in the film: a guy whose weapon of choice is a baseball bat (and ball), and a deaf (and mostly blind) woman who wields two hammers. I'll give them extra points for creativity there. The cinematography and fight choreography was also improved from the last film, and Gareth Evans really showed his talent for exquisitely composed images, fluid camera-work and comprehensibility in the action scenes. The score also enhanced the visuals by adding tension, but there were also moments of quiet which were just as effective. Overall, THE RAID 2 is a considerable improvement over the first, even if the story does lag in parts. However, the action keeps things moving along at a nice clip and you won't feel like you've just watched a two and a half hour movie. One of the year's best so far, and one of the best modern action films period.",

The action is still there, extreme and over the top (not a complaint), but Evans has still kept the tension that made the original so extraordinary. The final fight scene is immense and superior to the confrontation in number one between Rama and Mad Dog. Where that was raw and gritty, The Raid 2 produces an exchange that is technically amazing and visually stunning.I was worried that stretching the run time from 100 minutes to two and a half hours would damage the film.

My favorite action movie ever, The gory violence of The Raid 2 is a big \"screw you\" to PG-13 action movies. Some critics are already whining about the graphic bloodletting, some people hate movies bloody movies because the movie is so glory ? what ? what about story ? what about actors i have no idea why people watch the movie without knowing what it is ? but these are the same guys who hand out 90%approval ratings to movies with incompetent action and no edge \u2013 *cough* \"The Hunger Games 2: Catching Fire\" LAME (2013) *cough*, *cough* Robocop (2014) *COUGH* LAME even it got really worse ? Wolf Creek 2 (2014) that was worst movie ever made RAID 2 never has a Cough the Raid 2 was better sequel then Wolf Creek 2 i can be a defending movie The gore in \"The Raid 2\" isn't just randomly thrown in either. It's a logical consequence of the situation and characters, and it is applied in very creative ways. I have heard that Evans was only coerced to cut a few \"frames\" said on review BEST sequel 10.10",

And to its credit, this one was much bigger all around and way more ambitious.As always, the film looks great, the action is amazing, the actors are great athletes and solid actors, it's overall great film making. The only problem is some of the writing/story contrivances.This world is very realistic and keeps the tone throughout. Almost grimly sadistically realistic...so it does the film a disservice to resort to Kill Bill like style villains with really campy weapon choices.Come on people...a deaf woman in designer shades wielding two hammers? A guy in a hoodie who's really good at hitting baseballs at people?This is laughably weird and would fit in an X-Men movie, but not one of this caliber.And what is with these ultra-violent mafia members in Indonesia...sometimes they use guns and sometimes they use hands and martial arts or melee weapons? How did any of these idiots live this long? I can suspend disbelief like in the first film when one character said he'd rather use his fists than a gun, but in this film there is absolutely no reason for cold blooded gangsters to NOT protect themselves at all times with some type of firearm. They very randomly choose their spots of when to use weapons from the 21st century and sometimes from the stone age. A bit laughable and contrived.And like kill bill, too much of a good thing gets boring. We love the action and fight scenes, but it gets a bit long after a while and honestly the story and drama behind the scenes with the mafia family rivalry were way more fascinating than the elongated fight scenes. Entertaining and well done, just missed a big opportunity to keep it more consistently serious and could have reached a higher level than it did. Still very well done.",

            "content": "Whenever a sequel comes out to a great original, one thing is almost certain is that it won't live up to the original. However unlike many Hollywood spin offs, the sequel to 'The Raid' was already planned while the first movie was being filmed, in fact this is part of a trilogy. 'The Raid 2', titled 'Berandal', follows on from the exact point that the first movie ended. The lead; 'Rama' now has to go up against the entire underworld as he is instructed to find the corrupt officers within the police force. This movie has great action sequences, good suspense and enough blood to satisfy all fans of the original 'Raid' movie, however what it lacks is originality. Despite the heroics of the much awaited sequel, sadly we have seen it all before especially if you enjoy gangster movies from the Far East. The reason why 'The Raid-Redemption' is now a cult classic is that it had a unique concept, a SWAT team trapped in a high rise tower block habited by vicious criminals. It was like 'The Hunger Games' for adults and it was compelling. The sequel however offers nothing new, and the only thing that sells it is the fact that it is the sequel to 'The Raid'. As a standalone film, it's worth watching but it is not and could not be what it's iconic predecessor was, but hopefully this should not put you off.",

This film will waste your time if you're watching mainly for the violence. The story is hard to follow, the dialog is not really good, and the acting is at least somewhat decent. Other than that, the violence is spectacular. Awesome combat and great thrill. One other thing is that I really don't get why this film is rated higher than the previous installment. After 1 hour and 20 min I actually skipped to the fighting scenes, and I rarely do that. It just shows this that Gareth (the director) was trying to make us care for the story and it didn't work well.",

            "content": "The popular Indonesian frantic gruesome martial arts saga is back with a bang with Rama again in the middle promising more of what made the original so effective. With no expectations whatsoever, The Raid Redemption became a sleeper hit both with the audience as well as the critics with none having a clue of what hit them. The dynamics have changed now and people tend to expect and compare from which very few attempts hit the mark. This story starts from where its predecessor has left off with Rama (Iko Uwais) is getting debriefed at an unconventional location. A police chief coerces Rama into going undercover to both unearth another corrupt cop and also to take heat off from him and protect his family. Rama infiltrates the syndicate run by Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo) a wise patriarch through his hot blooded son Uco (Arifin Putra). He has to struggle to keep his identity a secret, discover the secrets, collect evidence and miss his wife and newly born son. When Uco comes up with his own agenda, can Rama survive?Since this story is out in the open world and not constrained within an apartment building - it is both good and bad. The innovation to excel within its limitations is where the original made its mark but in the open world - it is just as any other movie. The director tries to squeeze everything into it like the prison riots, car chases, modern gadgets along with its famous punches and kicks. He even brought back his Mad Dog Yahan Ruhian in different role with a completely different look. Everything looks like they should from a technical stand point but many things doesn't add up from dramatic and emotional point of view.The original had the relentless pace, even before the previous action set piece is concluded a new one is already midway. The same cannot be said here as it invests in a bigger story, more characters and their development which doesn't seem to be the director's strengths - leading to a bloated runtime. Its plot drivers are riddled with holes like what happens to the injured guy who will be taken away for treatment in the beginning, Rama is seen extremely struggling with an injury and a moment later he is fighting off dozens of bad guys without a sign of the injury and many such continuity issues. Bringing the story to the open world also introduces us to a long list of characters like the 'Hammer Girl' who is similar to Gogo from Kill Bill, the baseball bat guy, Uco and his father, his Japanese friend/rival and his son etc. where most characters get uninteresting in a short-while.With the element of surprise gone, the sequel struggles to compete as a regular action movie.",

            "content": "Firstly I'm an Indonesian, so without a doubt, both the first movie and this one makes me very proud. Good job everyone!Secondly, I'm going to be as subjective as i can. The first movie had a very simple plot (maybe even too simple..?) but that simplicity made it super exciting and had me on the edge of my seat for 80% of the time. This second movie however, does nothing of the sort. The fight scenes were perfect, shots were beautifully choreographed with appropriate slot- mo effects, awesome sets (mud prison fight! Woohoo!), and pencak silat skills were pitch perfect. Car chase scenes seemed to need more tight editing. Every time we return to Rama's car, it feels like they were replaying their fights a couple of times. I thought the guy on his right was tied up with the seat belt, but no, the next time we see them he got tied up (again) during the fight. Nevemind the odd geography (who cares if they can transport themselves from south Jakarta to north Jakarta just though a tunnel and back, or drive in oddly empty otherwise jammed roads!) but the speed of things, the rush.. Just wasn't quite there. I DID solely go to see the Raid 2 to watch them ruin a bus-way station, and it was awesome!There's a sense of too many story arc, back-stories, too many characters, too many names we can't remember. Too many for one movie. Everybody next to me was wondering who Reza was when the Japs mentioned that he was in Bejo's restaurant. I can see how the back-stories help, but by doing them, we lose focus of the main characters and each story becomes somewhat underdeveloped. Hammer girl and baseball guy were one example.. Are they lovers? Siblings? Friends? Frenemies? (And where can one get a baseball bat in a non-existent baseball community in Jakarta? Nevermind, lets not nitpick.)I get the idea to use Indonesian sounding names but Uco? Bejo?? Can't the young master, son of a mafia boss be named something cooler or modern? Ah, don't nitpick. Eka's final confession reminds me of the same car confessional scene in Infernal Affairs. Lets also get that out of my system. All of that up there were jarring (yes i did not mention mad dog because everybody knows it already) but the worst and unforgivable was the snow. In. Tropical. Jakarta. Snow. That one minor detail pulled me out of the movie, broke the fourth wall, because i thought hey maybe they were in Tokyo to attack the Japanese mob. No, wait, there's Mie Ayam (chicken noodles) stalls nearby. Which means that the scene was physically/ weather-wise impossible. The kitchen fight was superior than that of any other i've ever seen. Best showcase of pencak silat ever.Otherwise, the too ambitious movie presents a convoluted story and characters and felt somewhat unfocused. I did not get the same adrenaline rush as i did in the first movie, ie. remember that scene where Rama was hiding behind a wall and almost got killed by the sword that nipped his cheekbone? (Yes, notice the scar on his cheek, good detail!) I almost died watching that scene. But here, there's a sense that Rama won't die. Either because he doesn't, or because the scenes just weren't life threatening enough? I really don't know, but i was calm. And you don't want me calm during a life-and-death fight scene.Overall: great fights, albeit lacking rush. Convoluted mob plot with lots of pit holes. And snow. That damned snow.",

            "content": "I am not going to talk about its story at all. There is a decent bit of plot but you can read it on Wikipedia :) What I want to talk about is the direction, how many action scenes does the film have and how good they are.There are only 3 fight scenes in the first half each one of short duration. Two fight scenes are in prison. The first prison fight is like the Oldboy scene which was done in a narrow lane with a gang attacking one person. That scene had only one camera angle which was the side view angle. Here some more camera angles are used \u2013 side, top back and the fight is more intense. But its very short may be 1-1.5 minutes duration and ends abruptly. Not much in terms of any innovation in choreography but camera-work is good. There is one shadow boxing scene right after this scene where Iko Uwais displays tremendous box-speed on the wall. Its a vast improvement from his earlier outing in the Raid Redemption. He has bettered himself in terms of speed and seems to have got some training in Wing Chun boxing.The second fight scene is a prison riot where Iko saves the son of the gangster. Visually its like the riot mission of GTA Vice City PC game. It was a good opportunity to choreograph a one-vs-many fight but the director Gareth Evans limited it to one-vs-one and max one-vs-two fight. The fight is choreographed well but there is too much shaky camera work in this scene. Background music is very good in this scene and also throughout the film. Cinematography is quite good. Slow motion is used at appropriate places and never during the fight which was good. The third fight scene is in a warehouse and its a regular fight scene evading the possibility of one-vs-many.The film has better action scenes post intermission. It starts with the fight scene of a female henchwoman \"Hammer Girl\" with a gang of armed men in a train. The scene reminds you of a similar Uma Thurman fight scene in Kill Bill but unlike that shitty OTT scene directed by that idiot wannabe action filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, Gareth Evans has done a good job. The scene is very bloody and gory but quite realistic. Julie Estelle as the Hammer girl is not an exceptional talent like a Jeeja Yanin but she did well being an Indonesian model. There is one fight scene of Yayan Ruhian who played Mad Dog in part 1 and those who have seen part 1 know how good he was in the climax fight scene. He has 2 fight scenes in this, both choreographed very well. In fact his scene is better than even the scenes of Iko Uwais. He has knowledge of parkour combined with Penchak Silat. His death scene is classic not to be missed.The climax has 2 good fight scenes back to back. One is Iko Uwais vs Hammer girl & baseball bat man and another between Iko Uwais and Cecep Arif Rahman (guy in the first pic). First scene is a medley of Kama and baseball bat fight scene using techniques from Penchak Silat, Kung Fu and a bit of Kali. Basketball bat is used as the stick fight from Kali while the Kama is used for Silat and Kung Fu style. Iko Uwais uses Silat, Taekwondo and couple of Jujitsu ground techniques (joint locks, leg locks etc) this time which we never saw in part 1. So this was good.The final fight is a one-on-one between Iko Uwais and Cecep Arif Rahman and its the best choreographed scene technically. Various forms of fight styles are used and it ends with Kama fight with Iko Uwais slitting and slashing every part of Arifs body and then slashes his throat out, not recommended for fainthearted.Overall, I found that the film has good action scenes, better than any action film released in recent years but there is no one-vs-many scene in entire film. The USP of the film is the gore and violence, not technique and choreography. Mostly what we see in usual films is when bullet is fired or sword slashes the body, the screen blacks out cut to the next scene. But director Gareth Evans likes showing what happens after a bullet hits the head point blank, how the skull tears apart, how the Kama slashes the throat and how the veins and meat come out and so on :DA word on Iko Uwais in comparison to Tony Jaa, Micheal Jai white and Scott Adkins:Iko Uwais has bettered himself a lot in this outing. He has learnt some more fighting styles which I talked above. But I will still put him behind Tony Jaa and Scott Adkins as of now. He is surely the more quicker among the 4 but he is not yet ready to give us a good one- vs-many believable action scene. He has to learn some parkour techniques. I would put him above Micheal Jai White though.",

            "content": "My Thoughts:I am a really big fan of the first movie which is why I spent my own money and went to the theater to see the sequel. I thought the over the top action in The Raid was great and that Iko Uwais who plays Rama was a great action star. Sadly The Raid 2 just does not live up to the first one.The story in this movie is Rama agrees to go undercover to find out who the corrupt police officers are and report back to his new boss. Needless to say things go bad quickly. Instead of being in prison for only a few months Rama has to stay inside for two years. This helps him solidify a friendship with one of the underworld bosses son Uco (Arifin Putra). Bangun (Tio Pakusodewo) repays Rama by bringing him into his organization and becoming Uco's shadow. From there we find out that Uco is not happy with his position inside Daddy's organization and tries to make a deal with Bangun's rival Bejo ( Alex Abbad).The opening of the movie is very hard to follow due to the chop scenes that flip flop back and forth between happening right after The Raid to seeing Rama in prison, to other peoples story lines.I think one of the things that helped the first film is that it all took place in one location and the storyline didn't really matter cause you knew it was Rama going up against an apartment complex full of bad guys and we were in for a great martial arts film. This time we are outside and there are tons of different scenes and really the storyline is very generic and been there done that. One thing I kept looking for really is the next action scene because they do not disappoint be it the big prison fight, to hammer girl, or baseball boy. The martial arts action scenes are just great to watch. I just wish I could say that the story will keep your mind occupied while you wait to get to the next one.So if you just want to see it to watch the great action scenes I couldn't fault you but with an 150 minute run time it might be worth it to just wait so you can flash forwardMy Recommendation:Sadly I wish I could say go to the theater but I cannot.

            "content": "'The Raid 2' is a richly enthralling crime saga punctuated by extraordinary action that's as elegant as it is savage.Taking place immediately after the first film, it doesn't take long before a criminal underworld is established and Rama must go undercover for his family's safety. In doing so, he risks all, as he begins another terrifying odyssey of violence.Primed to quench anyones bloodlust with its onslaught of furious brutality, this Indonesian action thriller is unbelievable at times. It's seriously awards-worthy stuff, and particular mention must go to Gareth Evans' masterful direction who is in complete control of his craft, aswell as the inventive cinematography - every fight is expertly designed and executed, lingering with many long takes, and letting you relish in the thick of combat, which is a testament to all involved.This time it trades the grimy corridors of a drug-infested apartment block for a city of sordid corruption. Warehouse dens of criminals and mud-soaked prison environs are the playground for a series of ultra-violent set-pieces in this sequel; a film that manages to surpass the original for stylish choreography and gory kills. And once again Iko Uwais is the leading man, dishing out a brutal barrage of hurt to low-life scum adept at martial arts.This is a long film, but it earns its length, never squandering a minute. Fleshing out its corrupt world is first and foremost on Evans' mind, and the characters that inhabit it are given enough content to become an integral piece of the puzzle. And like any martial arts film, there are more than just the ordinary, disposable villains. Several of them can be best described as \"boss\" villains, and they serve to make life difficult for our persevering protagonist. They each come with their own unique skillset to mix things up, such as Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man (self-explanatory), who are given sufficient, entertaining screen time. But no one is a match for Rama, whose fists in hand-to-hand combat are as lethal as any gun or blade, and the last hour is chock full of demonstrations of his talent.This is as good as action gets, and the level of skill on display is evident everywhere you look. Gareth Evans presents another masterpiece of filmmaking, and it's as bloody as it is brilliant.",

I've come to realise how there are few times in life, and especially during the final exams, where you can take chances without worrying about the consequences. Watching this film vindicated to me that if you pick the right movie, watching film can be a mesmerising experience.Where to begin? The visual style of the film is expertly constructed with a varied colour palette and highly symbolic shots that pay homage to classic gangster films like The Godfather and Casino. Accompanying this feature is ingenious editing that makes you a participant of the action rather than an observer. It quickly becomes clear just how much work the filmmakers have put into making a highly realistic, gritty and visceral masterpiece.Most action films these days, despite the great effects, fail to capture your investment in the characters and sequences. Fortunately, this film forces you follow and care for the variety of characters, regardless of their moral high ground (or lack thereof). The way the seemingly unstoppable assassins of the film are established immediately convey how the protagonist is in for a rough and bloody ride, and set up the stakes with noticeable maturity. I found the story to be perfectly paced, despite its two hour thirty minute runtime, and enjoyed the balance between originality and tribute. Of course, despite the ride I enjoyed while watching it, this film is excessively violent and confronting in nature, and I'm glad that this movie holds a hard R18+ rating. I don't condone the violence that is portrayed on film, and I am giving a warning that this is a bloody and brutal film that might be challenging to watch. If that doesn't put you off, it's well worth hopping onto Netflix or iTunes to watch one of the most authentic albeit grizzly action films of all time.",

I have not seeing this much of hand to hand combat action after The Raid Redemption (2011) and this bone breaking second installment is fantastic. It packs a heavy and a lethal dose of adrenaline for the action movie lovers and that much of a does come seldom with effectiveness. Just like the first movie Raid 2 starts off calm and quiet and gradually builds its plot while becoming bloody and violent from floor to the ceiling.Raid 2 picks up from the end of the first movie. Rama (Iko Uwais) who is a cop in the Jakarta police force sent undercover to discover evidence of a large crime syndicate. To do this he must commit a crime and get himself in prison and get close to a son of an underworld boss who is serving sentence. While his initial undercover plan last a few months, once in prison he realizes that the game is uglier than expected.Raid 2 is exactly two and half hours long. And by the look of it it's an insane long for an action flick. But once the action hits the screen and plot starts to reveal the viewers will forget the clock entirely. (or maybe the clock got smashed in to pieces by all the punches and kicks). Not like the first movie which totally takes place in a 20 story drug run apartment Raid 2 hits the streets. And it hits the prisons, night clubs, subways and even road sides like action madness. And this has elegant looking yet blood thirsty bunch of villains and the most wanted element of a thumping action movie, car chases. Imagine all this combined with the sheer amount of punching power of the first movie. It's definitely bigger and better and this is something seldom I can say about sequels.I must keep a note about the action of Raid 2. It is obvious at a glance that it's natural and performed on location. As this is rare in movies these days the action choreography and pulling it off in such a brilliant way is truly commendable. And the viewers can actually feel the awesomeness of a pure combat with long action sequences and that's mind blowing. There is a high chance that you might miss lot of details in one viewing so just as I did maybe you have to pause, rewind and replay to catch them all. It's lightning fast!Though Raid 2 is violent and gore it is not violent up to the extent of unwatchable insanity. Therefore most viewers should be able to digest it. And violence is not the real thing to be worried about. It's the ample amount of kicks and punches and forever panning camera movements. If you manage to get through them and survive the cracked walls and shattered glasses Raid 2 will be one of the best action movies you have ever seeing. And this movie will go to my archives of repeat watch worthy action movies and believe me when I say this there is only handful there already (Including The Raid Redemption).",

            "content": "I'm giving this 8/10 for simply being good, but if you like the first Raid movie and want a sequel of a similar caliber, you are in for a disappointment. The first movie is unique, first of all for it's amazing fighting choreography, but also - in my opinion - for being a movie that has a 10 minute intro, and then the rest is pure adrenaline, with a story line that progresses simultaneously with a task force fighting and killing their way through a big building. The curve goes straight up from start to finish. It worked REALLY well. The second movie is, as said, good, but it's not the same by a long shot. The story plot is far more developed, and while it has interesting characters and plot turns, I was finding myself a little bored, just waiting for more fighting scenes. The adrenaline curve goes up and down, and there is no \"raid\" like in the first movie, just the same main character. Unless you call one person going 1 vs many in a hostile environment a raid. While I might come of a little negative here, not very open to change and all that, I'm simply writing this to adjust the expectations for whomever is reading this, so you can enjoy the movie more. I managed to rid myself of expectations early on in the movie as I understood and accepted it was going to be different, and enjoyed myself quite a bit. The fighting is just as awesome and brutal as in the first movie, but you are in for a more up-and-down type of build up, and a lot more talking. Enjoy! :)",

In both movies, the story flowed well, and the fight scenes had to be seen to be believed. I just finished watching RAID 2, and while its touted as a sequel (after all, the events happen 2 hours after RAID) it really isn't. A couple of characters from the first film make an appearance, but are quickly dispatched. If there is ANY connection, it would be Reza the police chief, but he is really kind of an afterthought in this film. RAID 2 is a mafia film without the guns, and the violence amped way up to 11. Coherent story line, characters that are very interesting, and fight scenes that words can't do justice to. Speaking of characters, Hammer Girl and her brother Baseball Bat Man definitely deserve their own spin off and I for one would love to see their back story. My chief complaint would be that they did not get enough screen time. Also Yayan Ruihan (Mad Dog from the first film) has a great part as a loyal assassin who kills to take care of his estranged family. His part was the most emotional and shocking of the film. There are so many stand out scenes in this film. There is a prison riot sequence that is outstanding, as well as the triple assassin sequence that needs to be watched. My favorite (well at least one of them) was the kitchen scene. Oh that kitchen scene. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I'm watching this one over and over again for sure.",

In terms of style, it's what Nicholas Winding Refn's 'Only God Forgives' could only wish it had been. It also benefits from a western director who knows his music and what film fans want.In terms of story, it could actually put many an acclaimed crime thriller to shame.

            "content": "\"How could you apologize to them, using their language, in our land\" -- UcokUcok (Arifin Putra), was the prince of Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo) family. He thought he would have his own charisma as how his father was. He was wrong. He got into a fight with another spoiled brat and was taken into prison. In the prison, he knew better, he should use his father name to scare people instead of relying on his own. He gathered a group of muscle man to protect him, lead by Beni.Those run well at the beginning. The prison guards let him walked with his gang, even let him brought knife everywhere inside the prison. Until a new guy came into prison and put on a show. Several person was beaten by the new guy alone in the toilet stall and this guy refused Ucok's offer to be part of his men.The new guy was Yudha (Iko Uwais), a man from nowhere, not affiliated to any group. Eka (Oka Antara), Bangun's caretaker, had run a background checking and confirmed to Ucok, Yudha did not came from any rival groups. Ucok took interest on him. But not until the incident of the prison riot, he could gain friendship from Yudha. In the riot itself, Ucok learned that he couldn't trust anyone, not even his own men. Two years later, when Yudha had been released from prison, Ucok personally picked him and drove him to his father. Ucok wanted Yudha to be part of his family. His father approved and put Yudha to be Ucok bodyguard. Yudha himself had successfully proved to be a great killing machine in his first task.Somehow, being a bodyguard, didn't mean Yudha would follow whatever Ucok wanted. The Karaoke incident told Ucok that Yudha had his own thought. While Yudha might be a killing machine, it seemed he could not enjoy the nightlife as other thugs. Worse, it seemed Yudha had his own moral code.Meanwhile, the Karaoke incident made Ucok learned that while his father was in power, it didn't make all people respect him. Yes, some people may aware of his father existence and afraid to insult him yet it didn't stop the other people to disobey Ucok. It didn't make Yudha, his own bodyguard, obey him either.And then, a mysterious call came. It offered Ucok to fulfill his ambition, to raise him into a new respected guy in a higher position than he was. The call came from Bejo and he invited Ucok to his restaurant.\"even by being a simple garbage man, I would have been considered as more successful man than my father ever was\" -- BejoBejo (Alex Abbad) came from a low class. He kept reminding himself how he came from a low class and he did not shy to tell that to other people, including his enemies. He was a social climber, a calculated one. He knew who should be ridden and who should be taken as company. His action, no matter how aggressive it was, was still considered as a small thing. Even though some Yakuza had suspect his move, they could lay hand of him since the scope of his action was small enough. The best they could do was report him to Bangun.However, Bejo was now ready to take a giant leap. He invited Ucok to his restaurant and offer him to build his own legend, to create his own charisma. In a humble proposal, he told Ucok that he only wanted a small land with no liability of protection money.Bejo told Ucok that to create a legend, they need a war. They had to unbalanced the structure so they could rebuild a new empire. Ucok had to sacrifice his own palace to raise the battle cry.And then start the battle scene which being praised by the audience in Sundance and SXSW Festival 2014.Arifin Putra, I've seen him in previous Indonesia film, Badai di Ujung Negeri and I was surprised he could actually act. The most amazing scene of him and also the scariest one was the Karaoke. That was so real and Yudha, the good guy, couldn't do anything on that scene. The karaoke girl could be slashed to death and there was nothing the protagonist could do.Alex Abbad, I loved when he played in Merantau. I knew I would be in treat when I heard he would be Bejo in this movie. And he didn't disappoint. Oka Antara. I have seen his movie a lot. Most of them were about being a kind and full of smile guy. I knew he tried to be different character. One of his movie where he tried to be 'bad guy' was Killers directed by Mo Brothers, yet I still saw him as a nice and kind guy. In The Raid 2, he was different. He became a serious guy on his job and there was no good guy anymore.Tio Pakusadewo. Uncle Tio is a senior actor, just like uncle Ray Sahetapy who played as Tama in the first movie. Here, he played Bangun, an old father who wished his son could learn patience.Yayan Ruhiyan. The Mad Dog of The Raid Redemption, returned as a totally different character. He played as an assassin and also an old servant of Bangun family. In return, Bangun family considered him as a close member of the family. When Ucok needs someone to express his anger, he would call Prakoso, the servant.",

The highlight of the film was a bad guy named \"Mad Dog\" who was the best fighter, but not able to take Rama and his brother.But on to Raid 2 - a much better movie. Plot better with Rama getting thrown purposefully into the slammer so he can get close to a crime lord's son. A number of good fight scenes - with the best being the \"mud fight\" in the prison yard - CLASSIC. Warning - this movie is non stop violence - so unless you are really into that - Stay Away.

            "content": "OK, best thing ever. Well best action film ever, but the out of control eye-bulging, gory choreography and its attempt to have a more elaborate plot than its predecessor catapults this film to nearly the top of my overall fav films list! There are only a couple small bb gun sized holes in this plot that make me scratch my head with contemplation during and after the film but certainly not enough to make me dock this film any stars. Just me being a critic and wanting this film to be as perfect as it seems. I wish I could just KISS Iko Uwais! Maybe I don't know much about pencak silat, the Indonesian martial arts discipline he has been training under since he was a kid, so I'm just too impressed with him, even though there's so much graphic, fast, brutal movement in each action sequence in this film. So sometimes I think the choreography was less about aesthetics, forcing Gareth Evans to try and keep up, or maybe the shakiness was intentional to add to the chaos. Or who knows? Maybe I don't know much about film direction/cinematography, so I'm making excuses for him.The occasional feeling of getting lost in the rough-housing in very long action sequences (particularly that orgy of violence in the muddy prison scene) in between scenes with more dialogue than the 1st film, and more complexity, are the only issues I have. I still need some help understanding Uco's relationship with Prakoso, and Uco making a deal with Bejo, and what all this has to do with Rama. So while trying to figure this out I was thrust into another mental action scene lol And I just told myself to forget it so I could indulge in the bloody drama on the screen again.Maybe this is why many action films seem to say \"to hell with plots and character development; let's just delicately (mostly lazily and sloppily) transition from one fight to the next.\" Something the 1st film \"The Raid: Redemption\" traditionally stuck to while still kicking so much visual ass unlike any other film in its genre and actually many other non-action films. Its simplicity was beautiful, and somehow \"Raid: Berandal's\" complexity was also something to appreciate. I just need to link the plot together a bit as I come down from the epic violence! Basically I can guess that Uco was naive in his decisions, and Rama had to stay lowkey as a right hand man with his own secret goals to not only do his job (to catch crooked cops working with Uco's dad) but to avenge his brother, who was done wrong by Bejo, that being a massive understatement. All the while Bejo and Uco end up teaming up, an unforeseen event, so Rama ended up in the right place afterall with the conveniently right vendetta. However, how would Rama have got close to Bejo if Bejo and Uco never teamed up? Something to do with the crooked cop Reza, I'm still unsure. Anyway, Prakoso, Uco's foot soldier who is scarily talented in street slaying, I think was the catalyst *(I was completely lost at 1st since the man playing Prakoso is the same man playing Rama's defeated foe Mad Dog in Raid 1)*. So either Uco was totally stupid and made a decision that afforded him his best fighter and \"family friend,\" OR he is so ruthless to do that to not only a \"family friend,\" but to try to coerce if not have a tantrum demanding his father to take the wrong perpetrators on FOR Bejo, of all vermin, swine and serpents! If it weren't for talk of \"The Raid 3\" coming out I would've thought the last scene was Rama's last scene; he was afterall doused in blood of his own and his opponents from vicious gashes and bullet wounds. The version I saw on TV translated in English subtitles, \"I'm done,\" as Rama's last words! So I was in too much shock to cry but felt like it! I thought he was surrendering! But everyone looks at me like I'm loopy, like they know something I don't!? And an Indonesian swore to me that it's not \"I'm done,\" as in honorably surrendering like he's about to die anyway, but that he was saying, \"Enough,\" as in, he wants out of this mission. I'm not sure. In any event, there's some themes of fatherhood and non-biological brotherhood here. That whole...not wanting to feel emasculated in a patriarchal environment, and that whole...foolhardy vengeance for a man's wounded ego in a dog eat dog world, and that whole...standing together against traitors and the world theme. All the while traitors were among that very brotherhood. So that's a new theme that the 1st film didn't have because it honestly didn't need it. It was simple: go inside, shoot, survive or not but we're rooting for you. I did love that there was a kick-ass female fighter here. I would've liked a BIT more brutal power, something always ALWAYS missing in action films!? The best female front I've seen in action martial arts films is Thailand's \"Chocolate\" but while her skill was totally evident, the power still wasn't there, just rehearsed keeling over when she touched someone.Well anyway I don't need to tell anyone anything about going to see this film before you die or before the night is up. All I can say is every time I come across someone who HASN'T seen this film...I can only shake my head and excuse myself from the conversation going nowhere with them.",

No catchphrases here, just an awesome action scene that lasted about 2 hours. So naturally the sequel might have run out of energy, boy was I wrong. This is WITHOUT A DOUBT the best action film of all time. Every fight scene was brilliantly created. The mud fight will be copied for years to come, the toilet scene will haunt Michael Bay for years and Watchofsky siblings will be amazed at the car chase cinematography, Tarantino will use the baseball gimmick for his next film and the club fight will be the shortest cool fight scene ever choreographed. And all of this for only 4.5 million dollars? While Bay spends 210 million on metal hitting metal and Aronfsky gets 140 million dollars for a stupid ark?

Iko Uwais cements himself as one of the best martial arts actors around today and I'm definitely a fan. Rama (Iko Uwais) barely escaped with his life after the events of The Raid: Redemption. The criminal element and corrupt cops he battled in the original strike back hard by going after his family as payback. It becomes painfully clear to Rama that he and his family will never be really be safe until he eliminates the upper upper echelon of the crime syndicate that now wants him dead. To do this, he must infiltrate their ranks by befriending the son of a king pin (Uco played by Arifin Putra) and gain his trust before exacting his revenge.The story is a bit more ambitious this time around, but is not overly complicated. All of the elements of the original are once again on display. The choreography is again, excellent; the fight choreography of The Raid: Redemption and this sequel are the best I've seen since the IP Man movies. The soundtrack is pulsating and sets the tone well for the action scenes very well. For a 2.5 hour long movie (I was shocked when I saw it was this long at the start), this was very well paced. At no point did it lull or meander and there was enough of story to keep me intrigued. I also enjoyed that the dialogue wasn't horrible (unfortunately that isn't always the case with many action movies) and wasn't over the top. Iko Uwais (The Raid, The Man from Tai Chi) is once again Rama. He's clearly a really talented martial artist and proves that the original was not a fluke. Unlike most action stars, he actually has a strong on screen presence and is also able to carry an emotionally subtle scene. But what I love about this sequel the most is is how creative and memorable the villains are. I loved Alex Abbad's performance as Bejo! He's the kind of memorable villain you've seen before, but with a few tweaks that make him seem fresh and new. He steals just about every scene he's in and takes this movie to another level in my opinion. Julie Estelle and Very Tri Yulisman (unknown actors to me) shine in some fairly unique action scenes (let's just say they are very creative with a few hammers and a baseball bat). Like the original, the action is non-stop and looks very believable. There are no clearly visible phantom punches or anything that looks staged. It definitely looks like these guys are actually beating the bleep out of each other! I couldn't have been more entertained. Honestly, the fights so thrilling at times I couldn't help but spontaneously applaud and were so gruesome at times I couldn't help but laugh. If you went into this for action, they made sure you were not going away disappointed; believe me when I say that. This movie oozes cool. Whether it's the brazen subway battle, the amazingly shot prison yard fight (especially the lead up to it which featured some great camera-work) or the impressive car chases (which reminded of The Matrix: Reloaded a little) there's a lot to love. They were all filmed with such style and flair that I was reminded of Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies; kudos to the director Gareth Evans. Evans doesn't over do it with the the artsy slow motion or scene staging, it's just enough to keep it from being cheesy or over used. I will definitely be looking for more of his work (more on that to come). It's not all perfect however. The drawback of this sequel is that in it's attempt to be be more daring, it does succumb to some of the usual genre pitfalls. The bad guys never seem to have the guns when they really need them (this was brutally obvious a few times) and at times the bad guys attack one at a time, one after the other, etc. When they do have the guns, they seem to miss a lot of point blank shots. But hey, it's an action movie, so none of that is surprising really. But one thing I just couldn't look past was the return of a character who died in the original. I get making that move in different film series, but to bring back a character that already died in the same series without any attempt to alter the character? That's a no go, at least for the sake of continuity. Apparently this is a common thing in Asian cinema, but it's something that's hard to look past as it was a prominent character from the original. Having said that, it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film, not for a second. The Raid: Redemption and The Raid 2 are setting a new standard for martial arts films. If you're an action film aficionado, be sure to watch this, you won't regret it. There is already a rumoured The Raid 3 that will star Tony Jaa along with Iko Uwais. Um, where do pre-order my tickets? As for as I'm concerned, The Raid 3 can't come soon enough!Was my review not horrible? Great!

            "content": "After reviewing the worldwide cult hit 'The Raid' in 2012, I knew there was going to be a sequel. As good as this Indonesian action film was, you had to ask yourself 'How on earth is the director going to top this?'. Welsh director Gareth Evans simply makes 'Raid 2' bigger, louder, harder, faster and nastier!\u00a0Easy really.'Raid 2' starts almost immediately after the conclusion of 'The Raid', where Rama (Iko Uwais) intends on ending police corruption in Jakarta, Indonesia. He approaches a shadowy internal affairs team, who convince Rama to go undercover in prison in order to get close to the local crime lord Ucok (Arifin Putra). Ucok's father Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo) is one of the big cheeses in the district who soon becomes embroiled in a gangland war. 'Raid 2' is an all-too familiar story of family, business, betrayal and police corruption, and Evans doesn't break new ground in the story.The only reason to watch 'Raid 2' is for the action, and by heck does this Welshman know action! He throws in some new characters to the mix; from the returning Yayan Ruhian who has morphed from Mad Dog into Prakaso; Baseball Bat Man, Hammer Girl, and the Assassin. Baseball Bat Man's comedy outweighs his fighting skills, he certainly knows how to make his bat go 'ping'! On the other hand, Hammer Girl (Julie Estelle) is a sight to behold, not least in a breathtaking tube-train fight scene. Just imagine what she could do with a fully kitted tool-belt! The Assassin (Cecep Arif Rahman) seems hell-bent on emulating and bettering Mad Dog's viciousness in the original. Crime boss Bejo (Alex Abbad) gets the prize for comedy villain, every time he was on camera he reminded me of Peter Sellars' Dr. Strangelove in Stanley Kubrick's aforementioned film, with possibly the worst side-parted hairstyle i've seen since Javier Bardem's barnet in the Coen brother's 'No Country For Old Men'.Rama has a face-off with all of them and many many many more. The first films success allowed Evans to script a bigger story on an even bigger budget, relishing the opportunity to expand his repertoire, and he doesn't disappoint. Crafting jaw-dropping set-piece after jaw-dropping set-piece, the cinematic inventiveness on show is breathtaking. And it isn't just fight sequences that he's now regarded in awe, unleashing an astonishing car chase which will leave you scratching your head in disbelief. This car chase is part of a glorious final act which effortlessly usurps anything in 'The Raid'. The inevitable fight between Rama and the Assassin is a seismic masterpiece of technique, editing, camera-work and choreography, especially in the lightening-fast close-up action shots. Contrasting the two fighters within a pristine white kitchen adds grace to the bone-crunching mayhem on show.Evans hasn't lost any of the claustrophobic intensity of the first film, who now shows off a whole new world of dangerous possibilities. The premise for 'Raid 2' may be simple, but the execution is anything but. 'Raid 2' is so good that you wonder why anyone would bother watching the first film (please do though!), a sequel that eclipses the original in virtually every way imaginable. If they haven't already, Hollywood or Hong Kong has got to put Gareth Evans on their payroll, as 'Raid 2' is an unparallelled action film that will embarrasses anything produced from those countries this year. Over to you South Korea, can you top this?",

This is probably the best fighting movie i have ever seen and it also has a deep immerse story which only adds to the flavor. The violence in this movie is brutal but so satisfying and the fights are just raw. You cant tell its been choreographed as the fight scenes are just so fluid.The only issue i have with the movie is the realism as there are times where you would expect some of the body guards to carry projectile weapons and just shoot the guy instead of using a knife but i guess you cant have more ridiculous fights if you just gave everyone a gun. Another thing is that our hero(Rama)is like Chuck Norris or Jack Bauer in this movie. The second he looks like hes too injured to fight then next thing you know he fights even better that hes all beat up. i would have like to see how people would have countered weapons more often than just making it easy to display the fight scenes. I personally find the scenes with guns involved that progress to fist fighting the most satisfying. Other then that minor complaint the story is good and the fight scenes are just jaw dropping. This movie is worth every penny.",

Lots of actions, no silly scenario, lots of tension and adrenaline. It was a fantastic movie. \"The Raid 2\" is not a bad movie, however you rarely get any excitement for any of the characters or for anything they are trying to achieve. The story is complicated but not very interesting. The new characters are borderline ridiculous (a 45kg lady with two hammers taking on 20 trained guys in the underground, a guy killing people with a baseball and a bat about 100 meters away). If you like comics so much, watch \"bad-ass\" or \"spider-man\" however that's not what I wanted tonight.Overall it's an average sequel, very disappointing considering how incredible the first movie was.",

But my fears were allayed, writer/director Gareth Edwards surpassed himself in just about every way possible over the original \"Raid\".What sets this apart from most action movies are what I call the \"in-between\" scenes, which are basically scenes that set up the next action sequence. In this movie, they are not just filler; they add a layer of depth rarely found in action movies. In this case, most of them relate to the central theme of ambition and how it can drive people to do dangerous things.Another thing I noticed in this movie is the brutality of the violence. This isn't over-the-top gore like you see in slasher movies, but rather what you can expect when two people meet with the intention of killing each other. In most martial art movies, the fights usually last until one fighter is too beaten to continue; in this it is usually to the death.If you like your action with some depth that is unflinching in its portrayal of violence, look no further.",

This is in no way a movie that can get to a complexity of its IMDb rating. It should have been around 6 as a bad scenario version of Jason Statham movies.

            "content": "Gareth Evans and Iko Uwais return for this eagerly ambitious and undeniably impressive martial-arts, action sequel, originally intended to be the first 'Raid' film. 'Redemption' took its place as the first instalment after funding for 'Berandal' fell through, successfully amassing a strong word-of-mouth presence - and therefore the word 'cult' constantly attached to it - and subsequently green-lighting the production of the sequel(s). This has allowed the dedicated Welsh director to finally put together his main event to what is now clearly the starter course of the first film, featuring choreography designed years before The Raid was even in the public consciousness that is so finely tuned and expertly executed it brings some of the most entertaining and memorable fighting set pieces you will see for some time. It is safe to say that true fans of the first film will be in some kind of delirious heaven, as I was, watching the follow-up, but those who attend based solely on the hyperbole of the TV spot proclaiming it to be 'The Dark Knight of action movies' (?) will likely leave after the first fifteen minutes. Hold your breath brain-dead straight-to-DVD action flick fans: this movie has . . . drama!Berendal states its intentions early with a slow-burning, exposition-heavy introduction, picking things up two hours after the events of Redemption, replete with smart graphic matches and parallel narratives. Rama (Uwais), one of the few survivors from the building-sized massacre of his first outing as a rookie cop, must now accept a mission to go deep undercover into the criminal underworld, of which what he faced before was just the tip of a very corrupted iceberg. It is a confident build-up featuring steady drama as a pre-cursor for the fairly complex, Infernal Affairs-like plot which is to follow. Suffice to say, if you had no idea as to the story of the first film, and do not follow the characters and key events at the beginning of the second, you will be lost as to what is going on, as Evans is admirably intent on providing an accompanying substance to The Raid's inimitable style. The story is not just a presence to provide space between fight scenes \u2013 the standard to which many action fan-pleasing flicks aspire to \u2013 it is important and detailed, and here is where the Dark Knight reference can at least be given some credence. The Raid: Redemption is a genre film, and The Raid as a franchise could easily have been a genre franchise, but what Berandal, and indeed The Dark Knight trilogy are desperate to do if nothing else is to weave deeper dynamics into the genre film. Sure tick the boxes of the genre, but here's a believable and well-conceived foundation for it all to take place on, because the drama and the world it takes place in are taken just as seriously as the action. Indeed, Evans is critical that action films are under-looked in terms of the recognition of dramatic performance, and in Berendal, he succeeds completely at displaying action as dramatic and emotional.Of course, Berandal is also here for its genre-stipulating action scenes \u2013 and oh boy, does it tick that box! If you are indeed one of the story- averse, in-it-for-the-money-shot movie folk alluded to before, The Raid: Berandal is worth an entire ticket-price for the last half an hour alone, let alone the impressive set pieces which are in-dispersed throughout the rest of its two and a half hour runtime. Those who haven't tuned out because no-one is kicking someone else in the head at the moment (just those damn words that keep appearing at the bottom of the screen!), as well as the rest of us who are loving every frame and appreciating the artistry in its entirety, will be treated to some incredible, inventive and hugely fun to watch fight scenes, chases, shootouts and stunt-work which benefit from an insane amount of training, trust and dedication to make them as visceral and impactful as possible. Evans incorporates his vision via maximum usage of how a camera can be a part of the fight itself by baiting the fourth wall and having the viewer be as involved in the fights and action as possible. The camera will fly through windows with the pursued, flipping upside down or horizontal in reaction to what has happened. It will fly through car windows as if by magic to capture everything in one shot. It will barely be missed by flurries of punches and kicks as it reacts to being almost impossibly close to the madness unfolding before it. We are also treated to infrequent body-shock horror as the brutality is also dialed up from Redemption, with many an item utilized to off the loser of a fight, and new henchmen with unique weaponry as their murder-item of choice. Just wait until you get to meet Hammer Girl and Baseball Boy \u2013 no, really!Berandal is much more than just a worthy sequel as it seeks to up the antes in every possible way. It offers an interesting, if arguably derivative, story which unfolds at its own pace, not when the action dictates it. Then, when action is called upon, it doesn't simply raise the bar \u2013 it takes the bar off and smashes it into your face. If Berandal is to 'suffer' the same 'cult hit' fate as its predecessor, maybe this isn't such a bad thing. A shame though it is that such a labour of love which attempts to take itself and the viewer seriously in delivering awesome style with respectful substance to back it up should fail as it has at the box office, we should probably enjoy such a creation in its purest form before Hollywood inevitably remakes, and therefore messes up, the franchise at some point in the future. Until then, be sure to make this vital viewing, while there is still life in it.",

A higher budget continuation of its' predecessor, this second outing is so different in nearly ever technical aspect, you'd swear Gareth Evans had been replaced between films. But no, with more money and an amazing amount of professional development from Evans, The Raid 2 shines not only as a martial arts masterpiece but an instant classic of gangster films and an erection-worthy piece of artistic mastery.Rama returns after the events of the first film, this time going undercover to take down all the corrupt police in Berendal. But, along the way, he becomes the shadow of the son of the local gang lord, gets caught up in intrigue as a new entity moves into the area, and ultimately winds up in the middle of an insane gang war.At two and a half hours long this film is daunting. And unlike the first that fills its runtime with nonstop action, Evans, having the budget he always wanted, made the movie he wanted the first film to be. We see more emphasis on dialogue (though much of it is terse, only there to build characters and push the plot forward). Character development is there as we watch the son, Uco, betray his father. The plot is pretty straightforward and Evans' script is beautiful in how little it explains things. It forces the viewer to pay attention and follow along. It's a movie that doesn't treat the audience like idiots.The first hour or so of the movie could potentially be a drag. Many fans of the first film despise this second outing because it's not the pure action movie that Redemption was. Compared to the grungy, low budget sets and directing of the first, The Raid 2 feels more art house and experimental. It opens on a long wide shot of a field with a car stopping in it. That sets the dark mood as well as the directorial angle. If you find that first shot pretentious and would prefer the more claustrophobic approach the first had (which denotes a sense of tension and fear that this film really doesn't need), then you won't be able to sit through this.As far as camera work goes, I think it is brilliant. Aside from the wide shots, the camera tends to follow the action in a way that I don't recall any other action film doing. When a person walks down the street, the camera follows (from the side usually, a tracking shot). When the action goes to the floor, the camera drops. When a person's head is slammed against something, the camera turns to the side. It's a neat way of keeping the viewer visually interested, as well as making the hits more impactful.And on that note, the editing and camera-work for the action is much better than Redemption. Longer sections of time go by without a cut and, especially in the prison yard fight, the shot feels like it is one continuous take. It's an editing trick where the camera moves from focusing on one point to another quickly and during that quick jerk of the camera, the cut is put in. In the final product, it all appears to be one take.Another thing that struck me immensely about this film is the set design. Pretty much every room in the film is very spartan. The sparse furniture tends to be modern and the colors tend to be blacks and whites. In many of the rooms, there's immense contrast. Take Bejo's restaurant for example. The red carpet clashes with the white linens on the tabletops. And the natural lighting emphasizes the contrast. Another scene where this is very prominent is the final kitchen fight. The spartan white kitchen is peopled by two marital artists in black. And the two spill blood everywhere. The contrast makes the fight scene that much more effective. The blood splattering everywhere makes the battle seem more gruesome than if it had taken place, say, in Bejo's restaurant proper. The same thing happens on the subway with Hammer Girl wearing a white dress. It's all about contrast.And one more little thing: there are a lot of mirrors and reflective surfaces (i.e sunglasses). Whether this is meant to reflect the inner turmoil of the characters or just another visually appealing design choice is up to the viewer.I can't rave about The Raid 2 enough. It's the kind of film I as an action fan and a snob have always wanted to see. It's a neon-lit, dark, gritty film that hits nearly every note it needs to. It reminds me a lot of 2011's Drive, another very stylistic action film. And I do think Gareth Evans took a lot of inspiration from that movie but he also seems to have bloomed into his own director.The Raid 2 is plodding without being boring, it's action packed without forgetting to tell a story, and it's brutal in a way so many movies avoid. With the open ending, lord only knows how Evans can top this masterpiece.",

            "content": "This is the first review I've written in 4 years since I thought I need to share my opinion about this.This is also the first Indonesian movie I've seen in cinema for the last 10 years after the child-movie-exploitation of \"Petualangan Sherina\"(In English: The Adventure of Sherina, you've never heard of it, right?) since they usually are much worse than Hollywood average TV-movies. I don't even watch the first Raid. But don't worry, I love movies and I've a lot of Hollywood First of all, I get what most people love about this. Unstoppable action; stylish gore; cool mafia appearance; some nicely shot, intense, and thoughtful scenes; I mean who could resist that? But, I'm gonna tell you what ignores me so much. It's the language. Maybe It's okay if you speak English, I bet the conversations look good on subtitle. But since Indonesia is my first language, I felt like most actors didn't speak like normal people do. It's too formal, it's not natural, it's like they are memorizing the scripts (which most actors do), and did not actually mean what they are saying. I understand movies through subtitles most of the time, and actors in the raid actually speak the kind of translated-subtitle-language where they should have used an every-day-language for conversation.Well, the rest I gotta say that the action are too much. There should be a little room for character development. Your hero, Rama, is a clich\u00e9 of one dimensional straight cop. The assassin, hammer girl, and baseball bat man, has too few parts. A little background story or maybe some reaction to the conflict involved would be nice rather than just swinging their favorite weapon.As for Prakoso, is the character just an excuse to use the martial art expert again? What kind of sequel uses the same actor for two different characters without any single explanation? I mean I'll buy it if he is mad dog's twin or something. Bejo had a potential to be an iconic villain but he just ends up as another clich\u00e9d evil boss. Two characters are better than the rest, Bangun has a very complex emotional depth and Uco although he ends up being a clich\u00e9d villain too, has some time to shine. Bangun and Uco have a good father-son relationship which saves the movie I gotta admit the opening scene is epic (that talk about ambition), the built-up to the conflict (the you-gotta-catch-more-bad-guys scenes) is good and informative, but then it gets to toilet fight, prison fight, subway fight, porn-production-house fight, car chase, etc where the story stops developing and Rama seems like just punching around and waiting until there is a group of people he can and should punch (Why does the prison fight actually start? Because some dude with a knife walks toward Rama? Seriously?).To be honest, after the movie, none of the fight scenes impress me. Yes, the choreography are well thought, but since there's an awful lot, there's nothing so special about each of them. There are no intensity, the how-is-he-gonna-survive-that? kind of moment. I just know that the hero will kill all the bad guys and save the day. After all, what kind of mob who hire people to kill someone with kung fu rather than using guns? But, two scenes also shine. The epic opening and slashing 4 guys while talking about power scene are top-notch.All in all, the raid 2 is nothing special. Just another bunch of hand to hand actions with mafia world background. One thing you need to enjoy this, you must love martial arts and violence because that's all you get. There's nothing wrong about it, I just expect more from an 8,9 rating. Turn off logic (snow in Jakarta, really? There's barely rain), desire for crime-flick, and everything else.",

I am not really much of a film critic, but that was the gnarliest, most badass, destructive action movie I have ever seen. The original \"The Raid\" was fast paced and brutal, but this one was cinema excellence.The first film was not much for character development; just brutalizing. This one lingered on every face long enough to gather a story and find them interesting. Even the pretty boy who you'd think would just be a bland Ken Doll comes through with some sort of passion. Using lots of long pauses to paint a picture of a scene; single take choreographed action sequences that last so long that I found myself sweating; and a few brief side characters in several scenes to ooze character development for someone who is about to have their face kicked in; and several instances of creative use of America's pastime, I give this 4 stars on the \"Houston wishes he was this cool\" scale. 3 hours long and totally worth it.Who knew Indonesia had an amazing martial arts film in them like this?",

The only negative about this film is a minor one. The dub version has terrible voice acting. I know it's subjective but hear me out. watch the sub version with subtitles. Anyways, if you are a action junkie or a fan of the previous film. Than raid 2 WILL NOT Disappoint.(Also this movie has a budget of 4.5 million dollars but feels 20 times more than that. Seriously, 100 million dollar budget films don't even compare technically to the raid's 2 suspenseful packed art-style.

The dialogue and acting is also very good, which is rare in such movies.Slight gripes with the film is that the first couple of scenes are a bit confusing, and requires you to fill in the blanks and pay close attention, like a Tarantino film. There's a certain character that felt shoehorned and is barely in the movie, and fans of the first will know what I mean. Also, I wished the movie was just a little bit longer. There's a scene near the end of the film that I wished showed a bit more then I would've loved this movie more.But other than that, The Raid 2 definitely lives up to the hype and absolutely puts Hollywood to shame.

So, to be fair to it, I'm giving it a secondary review with my brain turned off. With that out of the way, shall we get started? The Raid 2 is all about a police officer who goes undercover but gets way in over his head. It is supposed to be a brief job but instead it turns into a 2+ year endeavor.The film poster's tagline of \"One of the greatest action movies ever made\" is no exaggeration. Seriously. In terms of action sequences, set pieces, and choreography, The Raid 2 is top tier. The character acting in this also makes these things more believable and intense. The soundtrack and design of it also adds a layer of depth. Unfortunately, the movie is bogged down by logical inconsistencies and plot holes that kind of take you out of it.While watching the movie. There were multiple instances of events that occur that make you question the legitimacy of things. One of the biggest flaws in my opinion was the crime organizations lack of firearm usage. They obviously have the means and capability to use guns. But, refuse to do so on a consistent basis. It's not like guns do not exist in the movie Universe. There are a couple scenes where they are employed. So my question is why not just have them throughout the movie?The plot of the movie is also not that believable. Here you have a story about a police officer who goes undercover but gets in over his head. Once starts hitting the fan, why doesn't the main character just quit the force and leave? The main character even brings this question up. His identity is safe and his family is safe, so why not just go? He has plenty of evidence to bring down this crime syndicate. But, no his Handler is just like \"oh well we need to get them on corruption charges\". Seriously man? Come on.Finally, the film clocks in at 2 hour and 30 minutes. Boy, do you feel that too. While watching the movie I found myself just waiting for the next fight scene. To be honest, I did not care about the story or plot because it was that bad. There are plenty of movies out there that are long. Ive seen plenty where they suck you in and you don't feel the time pass. This one however drags on. While yes The Raid 2 has phenomenal action, it has all of these other elements that make it lack luster. You are honestly better off watching all of the action scenes on YouTube.",

            "content": "The Raid 2 is an Indonesian martial arts crime action film written and directed by Gareth Evans and is the sequel to the 2012 hit The Raid: Redemption. The film follows SWAT member Rama, the protagonist of the first film, as he is sent undercover to take down both corruption in his police force and the gangs of the criminal underworld. Iko Uwais reprises his role as Rama. The film also stars Arifin Putra, Julie Estelle, Alex Abbad, Tio Pakusadewo, Oka Antara, and Cecep A. Rahman. Director Gareth Evans admirably attempts to expand the world of the original The Raid exponentially through the use of astute writing, meaning that the characters previously confined to the constricted space of a high-rise building are now able to display their extraordinary martial art skills in a variety of distinctive locations. Whilst almost every fight sequence in the film manages to almost reach perfection, the muddy fight within the film's opening act must be mentioned specifically as the combined ferocity and gracefulness of the actor's complicated choreography is performed flawlessly. At times their performances perhaps arguably even transcend the medium as a whole; with their gloriously accurate actions being more akin to dance styles like ballet than an action film. Impressively these fight sequences remain feeling fresh and innovative, even within the film's lengthy 150 minute running time. The Raid 2 is a film which revels just as much in its subtlety as it does in its barefaced violence. Consistently the discreet and ever- present non-diegetic music contributes enormously to the brooding atmosphere that the director constructs, as does the precisely constructed and gorgeous mise-en-scene. Arguably the film's greatest achievement is this seamless mix of violence and subtlety, as at no point do these binary oppositions appear jarring or distracting. The film manages to surpass the extraordinary feats of its predecessor, cementing itself as one of the best action film series this decade \u2013 a truly captivating piece of work.",

Rama thinks its all over after the Raid but to truly end it all he has to infiltrate a gang and work his way up till he can get to the corrupt cops and politicians letting it all happen. This film was just awesome to watch plot wise this film improved massively from the first. To watch Roma gain the trust of these gang members was so intriguing. The story reminded me a lot of The Departed which is high praise indeed. Having a more complex plot meant branching out into different environments, in the first you were very much in one building throughout, with a storyline like this it gives you licence to go into different places which made for some great looking scenes and cinematography that you couldn't get with the rather neglected building in the first. The leader of the the gang Bangun played very well by Tio Pakusodewo showed he was a powerful figure his performance was great to watch. Arifin Putra played his son Uco who only wants his farther's respect and some more responsibility, when he can't get this, you see it eat away at him as the film goes on and to watch him do the things he dose in order to get it was really intriguing. Rama was completely bad ass in this film if you thought he was in the first you've seen nothing yet. The fight scenes were as gripping as in the first film which was great to see. Also this film has one of the best car chase scenes ever! Its not just camera flicks between a close up of one guy in a car at high speed looking angry and another close up shot of another guy all bloody and angry driving fast. Gareth Evans thought you know what why can't we have people hanging out side the car and stuff happening in the car and maybe we could shoot it from more than one angel. Well he did and it was truly extraordinary too see. This film was not without its problems tho. There is much more dialog in this film and it can take away from the thrilling action at times. Then Yayan Ruhian is back in this film which was a bit confusing, was he Mad Dog from the first film? No, but they didn't change his appearance enough for everyone to get that and his whole part in the film felt a bit unnecessary to me. Overall I thought this film was just as good if not better than the first. With a much more compelling plot that kept you guessing till the end.",

The story line is not particularly great; I found it to be no different than any other crime-thriller. However, the one saving grace is the action. All the action we loved about the first movie, all the fighting, shooting, chaos, and mayhem, are now spread across an entire city in various locations rather than being confined to one apartment building. Some people prefer the one location as it makes for a more intense, survival themed, Die Hard style experience. However, the new location set in prisons, subways, streets, night clubs, restaurants, alleyways, etc., provide for a chance to be more creative with the action. The Raid 2 has one of the best car chases I have ever seen in a movie! Not unlike it's predecessor, the fight scenes are graphic and palpable, everything is easy to see and the filmmakers do not \"cheat\" by using shaky-cam and quick cut shots so they do not have to show what is happening. Everything is shown in brutal glory and NOTHING is left to the imagination. The climax is so adrenaline- pumping and action-packed that I was practically laughing at how ridiculously brutal it became. In addition to countless epic action scenes, the characters are more developed and interesting than in the first. Some characters I actually cared about, and the movie also has a few very good villains. The drama and internal conflict makes the action scenes more intense because you actually care, at least somewhat, for the characters and you want them to survive.

This is my mind is easily in my top 3 martial arts movies of all time.The action is introduced early on but only get a glimpse, a taste, an appetizer. Throughout the movie the action ramps up culminating to a flurry of beautifully choreographed mayhem. The action and the fight scenes are not for the faint of heart either. You hear bones breaking, you see bones breaking, you see blood splattering everywhere, and the brutality unlike many movies feels real because the shots are up close and personal. No guy getting blown up or crushed by a bus dozens of feet away, you are there, and it looks excruciating.The fight scenes, the cinematography, the story is beautifully done to create a masterpiece of chaos. The movie is almost 2 and a half hours long, but it doesn't feel like it. Every scene dives deeper into the realm of danger that is Rama's life. Ever deeper the plot thickens, ever more the action escalates. The villains are well done, but are not the main source of Rama's problems.Mad Dog, Hammer girl and bat boy are martial arts dynamos who get their own appearances and ability to showcase their brand of style and prowess before the face-off with Rama. This serves as an appetizer and a sense of just how dangerous they can be and gives question to how is it gonna play out. They serve as the agents of evil for the madmen who lead them. Unlike other movies, the martial art baddies lean more on the side of fists to the highest bidder. You know they work for the bad guys, but you get the sense and feel that they work for whoever can get them the most challenge, the most to pit their wits and might against.The movie never feels drawn out, or too long. You only get the sense of questioning how much more carnage can be squeezed out, and it never flutters. By the time the movie is done you feel as if only just moments before hit the brakes.The action sequences are the thing of legend and serve as a tool to learn from. The amount of time between various angle shots and image breaks is long. The camera work and choreography for the fights took many months and it shows. You have real martial artists as actors, and it shows. Very much like having Jackie Chan, Tony Jaa, Jet Li, Bruce Lee, and other titans in the game, you have more chances of them not only performing their own stunts but also wanting to showcase their abilities by being part of the choreograph team. It takes a director such as Evens to be able to maximize runtime between cuts by doing some interesting camera work only seen by those who directors who truly love fight scenes.This movie focuses on the brutality and the relentless focus that is one man's quest to doing his mission and getting back to his family.2 and a half hours of brilliance, beauty and utter destruction. Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this gem, it will remain one of my top 3 martial arts films for the foreseeable future and will certainly take a great deal of effort to knock it off that list.\nI challenge directors to make martial arts movies this good.

Pro One thing for sure we agree that this is the best action movies of all time that made from and by Indonesian, and can be said that the action and fighting are equal to Hollywood movies, probably better.Cons since this is a sequel, I'm pretty much hoping for explanation of the background of the story. But I only got blurry explanation here and flaws here. In what city or country exactly are we talking here??? the background when Prakoso died, he died in an alley with snow (all the white thing) I presume, but it suddenly weird when the background of Bejo and Cecep that says \"Mie Ayam\" or something like that. since when Indonesia have winter season?Next part, when Bunawar ask Rama to join his force. the way he talks from \"Gue & Lu\" changed into \"Saya & Kamu\". I know it's only minor but for me it really confused me in my understanding of the character.Part when Bemi sit next to Uco in the prison, I conclude that he is Uco's men. but then he tries to kill Uco in the yard...???The character Bejo itself. From the appearance together with his attitude, way of speak, and costume, at first I think that he is a cold hearted bad guy. but it suddenly disappear when he dropped his stick knowing that Rama coming. from a bad guy to a coward...???Prakoso part, I know that Yayan Ruhiyan play as different role/ character here. but It already planted in my memory his role as mad dog. so just makes me feels WTF.Part Rama and Cecep Fighting. Why don't Cecep just use his weapon (Kerambit) to fight Iko. And since it is in the kitchen why don't Rama use all the knife that usually there in the kitchen? I just can says that maybe the movie want to introduce Indonesian martial art and weapon to the world.Conclusion For me myself, regardless of the story line, this is the best movies I've had ever watch. and hopefully that this won't become a trilogy. since all the past sequel/trilogy movies I've ever watched, every part will loose it's originality and the story will just disappear.",

I expected just more of the same, but my Expectations were completely surpassed, and literally everything in this sequel was better than in the first one.This is due to the again absolutely amazing directed action scenes, which are much more violent and better paced now. The fights get faster and faster and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Especially the climax of the movie is so stylized directed, that its a blast to look at.Even the Story of The Raid 2 is more interesting than in the first one, and also not that linear anymore. There are some interesting characters, like the deaf-mute hammer Woman or the Bad Baseball Guy (Or whatever you wanna call them) who aren't getting that much screen time, but have a certain charisma, which makes them that interesting.In the end, a good action movie should entertain me, and did The Raid 2 that? Oh hell yes it did! There was literally not a single moment in the movie I was bored, and not a lot movies can do that.So...if you were a fan of The Raid Redemption, you will watch this one anyway, but for everyone who likes stylized and violent action, this is a MUST SEE!P.S. Looking forward to Gareth Evans next movies (apart from Raid 3), and hope he gets more budget, to show his full potential. (And sorry for the bad English)",

And also Prakoso, he's a really good character in this sequel who has to die so early. While people who have watched this movie Favorited Rama, i kinda Favorited Eka, he's cool and his attitude is also nice in this movie. And Uco succeed make the audience hate him because his arrogance and cruel decision to join Bejo group and then Sabotage Prakoso death and shot his own father.The Action in this movie is so 'Delicious'. Especially when Rama vs Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man and then fight the Assassin in the kitchen. So brilliant!!! Oh and also not forget to mention the car chase scene... It's beautiful!!! So, if you are action movie lover and love the first movie The Raid Redemption, you will definitely love The Raid 2!!! Anyway, if you guys wanna watch this movie, i recommend you to watch the first movie so that you'll not confused by the story.SEE IT!!! Good Luck...",

            "content": "So rare is it that a mode of entertainment exists solely on the foundation of ubiquitous chaos, juxtaposing both visual harmony and emotional resolve against its very design. This, of course, encompasses the brutality by which The Raid: Redemption whispered sweet nothings into my ear, delivering my battered soul from the notion that cinematic tinsel is but a nutty dookie adorned with tinfoil and empty promises. But I digress.Those elements which made Redemptiom a drop kick after my own heart were sadly absent in The Raid: Berandal, possibly upholding a belief that all that is born must soon grown up. Sure a properly designed outline sets a course by which all things are to align, but in a dreary effort to appease those minds which exist solely in a vacuum (a highly presumptive attack on the established academics of critique), the complexity of foreplay in this case annulled the emotional integrity Redemption had established - it seems there is nary a high from which one cannot descend.To spare you another story-line rehash, Berandal did in fact deliver bursts of throat-punching, power slides, and general badassery which in itself helped the ol' endorphins become ambulatory and that is always pretty awesome. But unlike Redemption these scenes felt rather static, existing only as an obligatory \"what's up?!\" to its predecessor without much pause towards its relevance. Not awesome. A movie predicated on ass-kicking thumbing its nose at the perpetual motion so endearing to its genesis has only the effect of driving this viewer back to the fields of tinseled poo in pursuit of the rare mineral within. Berandal was (and is) watchable, let's make that clear. For my money, however, \"watchable\" doesn't translate to \"super-happy-number-one-fun-time\" in that attention to Berandal's story evolution ironically devolves the emotional effect had by Redemption (see aforementioned hyper-technical adjective).",

            "content": "This film could have been called The Talented Mr Edwards, as Gareth Edwards wrote, directed and edited it, doing a great job throughout. I found it slightly more accessible than the ultra violent original from 2011, being broader in scope and with more 3 dimensional characterisation. You could argue that the pacing has been improved as well, as it takes the time to build the story and characters before launching fully into the carnage. It actually lulls you into a false sense of security in the way the violence is depicted. In the earlier fight scenes, the camera tends to pull away from showing the full detail of the injuries being inflicted. As the film progresses, the camera lingers more and more, until you get the full experience of the original, and a touch more. A couple of scenes go a bit too far for me, but judging by the reaction in the screening I went to, the intended audience loved every minute. If it was all about the violence and nothing else, The Raid 2 would ultimately get very boring, but Edwards excels at the whole package. The stunt work is top notch (bringing Jackie Chan to mind at times), the camera-work brilliantly inventive, the soundtrack is beautifully judged (again), the sound effects have you wincing at every impact and the fight scenes are shot and edited so you can actually follow what's going on. The bad guys are memorable as well, with a couple of them, Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man, reminiscent of characters from Kick Ass. So, sounds like a 10/10 movie then? Well, not quite. For a start, as I mentioned earlier, a couple of scenes push the boundaries of good taste in my opinion, which is probably the point, but still. Then there's the plot. Not bad, I just found it a bit confusing at times. May be down to the cultural divide, or may just be me. The Raid 2 is a brutally violent and at times gruelling action movie, but it's also the freshest take on the genre for years.",

Numerous times we see them running towards the hero in the background, 3,4,5 at a time only to have one attack and then another with the rest still running in from the background.

I struggle to find the words to substantiate just how good this film is; the culmination of meticulously thought out action scenes with an engrossing story line is little short of extinct in recent film making, yet somehow, from somewhere, The Raid 2 emerges like Usain Bolt on a barren sprint track and demolishes the 100m record....Tony Jaa and his promotional team should be watching and, not so much taking notes, but more utterly plagiarising this phenomenon. Nobody was more disappointed in the follow up films to \"Ong Bak\" and \"Warrior King\" than I; having to witness such a promising franchise/individual be so vehemently decimated in subsequent excretions was painful, and if it weren't for the masterful efforts of Donnie Yen in the later \"Ip Man\" films, I'd have been close to calling the genre dead. Not only has this film restored my faith in martial arts film making, it has completely resurrected what was fast becoming a talentless pool of unfortunate atrocities.The Raid 2 is by far and a way, the most gratifying action film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. My only criticism is that it's not a 10 season long series, and that future genre releases will undoubtedly fail to match the insurmountable standard this revolution has set.I'd like to sincerely offer my deepest thanks to the entire cast and director for gracing me with the existence of this craftsmanship - along with god for blessing me with the eyesight to witness it.",

            "content": "Gareth Evans has created an outstanding visual action masterpiece with his hit sequel \"The Raid 2\". He has successfully asserted himself as one of my favourite up and coming directors who has a keen eye for visual flair and unique direction.The Raid 2 takes place almost immediately after the first film: Rama (our main protagonist and the Hero of the first film) has taken down crime boss Tama and is trying to ensure his safety by placing evidence of dirty cops into Police Commissioner Bunawar's hands (whom we are told is one of the last few good and trustworthy cops in Jakarta). Unfortunately, in order to ensure his family's safety Rama must go undercover and Infiltrate a local crime gang by gaining the trust of a Crime Lords Son. The film follows Rama's journey as he tries to get evidence on bribed officials. However, Rama gets in deep very quickly and, of course, must fight his way out.Let me begin by saying that the story itself is engaging in itself: whereas the first film focused on the combat and the choreography and only demonstrated the story in small parts throughout the film the sequel combined the visual style from the first and added more emphasis on the story. The plot of this film is exciting and thrilling and it demonstrates that an action film with a heavy emphasis on fighting can also have a very absorbing story. You will find yourself interested in the plights of each character as they each suffer their own physical and emotional pain. The story itself has some good twists and always keeps the suspense up. I don't want to include any spoilers but I have to say that Bejo is one of the coolest villains to watch out for. While seeing the first film helps, and the story can be a tad confusing at times as you learn about each faction, you will still be hooked on this story right from the get go.Evans accomplishes the unbelievable as a director. Every scene is crafted to perfection. It's hard to not feel the mood of every environment that the film drops you in and you can tell that colour, style and mood play an important part of the film. This is evident through the set pieces such as the prison yard, Bejo's restaurant and Bangun's office. Let me just say this film produces the kind of emotion through setting that you can't really get anywhere else. The setting is immersive, a feat that is hard to achieve in modern cinema, but Evans pulls it off seamlessly.When I went in to watch this film I expected lots of action. I was not disappointed. The fighting style is much the same as it was in the first film but here the battles in \"The Raid 2\" are spectacular. Sometimes the battles will be huge as one man faces off against a small army, other times the fight will be one against one as the contenders demonstrate their fighting prowess. It's safe to say that the fighting choreography is truly spectacular.The score doesn't put you off from the film but instead it helps heighten the mood at the necessary points. In fact I was surprised by the lack of a score in some places (usually at the start of a battle or a fight) which made the scenes so much more thrilling. The editing was quick when it needed to be but the longer takes were unbelievably skillful. I recall two scenes in particular that made excellent use of a long take: one scene in the prison yard where the camera follows the violence as it unfolds and another scene during a car chase where the camera passes through cars and such and follows the chase. As I said, truly skillful.In conclusion, this has to be one of my most favourite films of the year, if not the decade. Action, thrills and suspense. Gareth Evans has made a film that is so seamless and visually entertaining that it will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole film. I came to this movie expecting action galore and while I got that I stayed for the visual flair and the story. This film has truly stepped up from its predecessor. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to be excited, thrilled and surprised by a film. This film raises the bar.After all, it's a question of ambition, really...",

This was choreography and stunts like the old Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies. Which brings me to the Raid 2. This sequel absolutely blew me away in every way and out did the Raid: Redemption. The stunts, camera work, plot, violence, action sequences, and scenery were..... outstanding. This is a movie that is made for martial arts fans, for action fans, and for organized crime fans and it succeeds on every single level. I saw this on opening day in a crowded theater and the audience was completely hooked. With each bone snap and crazy stunt a cry of sympathetic pain arose. There were many unanimous \"Oh S**t!!\" and lots of squirming and \"arugh!\" The Raid 2 succeeded in eliciting a response from the audience that I hadn't experienced in quite some time. The last time would have been the Raid: Redemption and before that, I can't recall. This movie is an incredible sequel. It is ultra violent, though so be forewarned. If you enjoyed the first one, the sequel stands taller and gives you a lot more to work with. It is also stand alone an awesome movie. I can't recommend this enough to anyone who is sick of the Michael Bay brand of action movie and is thirsting for something original and well executed.

It's scope is larger and the plot is deeper and the characters more fleshed out. Rama by the way is a great character. Easily likable. He's really somebody you root for, like John Maclean from the Die Hard films. This time Rama is sent undercover into the criminal underworld to expose a conspiracy, posing as an aspiring thug. There's not much more to the plot than that, and acting is serviceable at best. But nobody watches these movies for the acting. You watch them for the action sequences, and the action in The Raid 2 is in a class of it's own. It has fight scenes that are just spectacular. They are frenetic, creative,\nand bloody. They're also filmed with an old school clarity. The cameras seem to remain steady with plenty of wide takes so you can see every blow. No jump cuts or ridiculous camera shaking to hide deficiencies in the choreography, like the actors being to old or too untrained to actually do this stuff. These actors all seem to know what they're doing, and it's filmed with clarity for the audience to see. I think The Raid 2 is a blueprint for how action should be filmed. There has been talk of a third installment, but I don't know how you would improve on part 2. I haven't seen an action film better than this.",

Never the less some really brilliant choreography of action sequence in the movie. Why do they have to spoil it with clich\u00e9s in the middle of the fights!!IMDb must change the way they rank movies. This movie is going to be a huge hit but it does not deserve to be ranked in the top 250. It might turn out to be a cult film in the decades to come and it probably deserves those accolades, after all it is well made for its genre.You see a bit of old boy, internal affairs, kill bill (and a very faint hint of Tarantino), ong-bak, and a lot more action movies of the east and west thrown in with a bit of the directors originality but after a while it gets weary. May be its just me, as i said i am getting old for this kind of movies. Good luck!",

I was happily amazed at the complexity of the story, the acting, the camera work and the action. Oh, the fight sequences were amazing. If you don't mind subtitles, you should watch this but see The Raid: Redemption first to be sure because Berandal follows up where Redemption finishes. If you miss the first, you won't understand Berandal as well as you should. One thing that stands out at me in both movies is the character of the villains. The colour they put into each villain makes you want to follow their stories within the story. The cops are portrayed as more \"black and white\". It makes you question where you want to put your loyalties during the course of the movie. It makes you connect with the bad guys but ultimately you cheer for the hero. His character was written beautifully! 9 stars out of 10!!! I loved this movie!!!!!",

The film is very much about the fighting scenes of which there isn't much variation. They are all in the line of one Martial Arts expert meeting ten or more opponents and knocking all of them down. You would think that at least some of the gangsters would carry a gun and simply shoot down the attacker, especially since there's a lot of other scenes in the film where there's a lot of firearms on display. But then we would of course miss out on a lot of the action scenes. There's also some plot holes but nothing major.

Top that off with an engaging crime story packed with gang lords, assassins and corrupt cops, and you've got one hell of a motion picture. Not only is this a very enjoyable movie, but it also largely improves on its predecessor in terms of story, character development, and action choreography (similar to the formula of The Dark Knight). To be honest, the director of The Raid and The Raid 2 makes Hollywood director Michael Bay look like a rookie in action cinema.

            "content": "As with the first movie, \"Pencak silat\", mixed Indonesian martial arts, Gareth Evans' favorite, is the basis for fighting scenes in Berandal as well. The main goal of this movie is realistic chest to chest combat, so there's plenty of blood and violence, of course, but the thing that stands out, in a bit bizarre way, is the creativity of that violence and ways that people get killed.The first part was exceptional in its main idea of the whole movie taking place in a couple of hours inside of a building. Berandal is somewhat more conventional and takes place during much wider period of time, even though it starts only a couple of hours after the first movie.A few flaws of the movie are usual flaws of action movies. Character development is a side thing and not very thorough, which is, again, expected. Same thing can be said about acting. Also, existing character development is achieved mainly through violence which results in a number of bloody scenes who have some significance, but sometimes are a bit unnecessary, which is something I, personally, didn't notice in the first movie. The use of cold weapons is, in a couple of moments, a bit nonsensical given the fact that a gun could be used instead, although the movie uses more than 60 different types of fire arms. Those are, just to be clear, some minor cons.General impression is that The Raid 2: Berandal does an astonishing job in delivering just what we expected. Skepticism is a common thing when it comes to sequels, especially the sequels of successful movies, so the expectations were big for this one. Nonetheless, everything that made the first movie one of the most original and unique action movies and a movie which totally freshened up the whole genre is present in the sequel, along with a couple of very wise, logical and useful additional details. Fight scenes are truly spectacular and breathtaking, and the fact that some action sequences who last only a couple of minutes were filmed for days shows how dedicated to realism and authenticity the whole crew behind this picture was.On the other hand, exhilarating dynamic of directing, perfect use of camera and extremely well timed and placed use of slow motion contribute to an insanely frantic tempo of the movie, tight atmosphere and top notch experience for the audience.If you don't like action movies, you probably won't start doing so after this one, but all of you who enjoy this type of films will look upon Berandal as a true classic. Also, all cinema-lovers and people who appreciate good filmmaking will find plenty of details worth of admiration in this film.88/100",

            "review_title": "Great Fights, Unnecessary Gore",
            "content": "The Raid 2: Berandal (a Movie by Gareth Evans) ReviewQuite a few disappointments I have after watching Berandal. Gonna breakdown in a few things: 1. A lot of people said it has a good story and a good character development. I say bull! Its story contains shady drama, illogical background, unrealistic conversation, and stupid-yet-almost impossible plot. I could care less about the story, but come on, you got to admit for a 150 minutes action movie, it drag you down to a minor boredom when they try to explain everything. I might compare Berandal's pace to Liam Neeson's Taken. Remember how bored you are for the half of the movie? This movie gives the same vibe. And yes, I am bored when it's trying to build up a back story.2. I wonder what does Gareth try to accomplish with all the unnecessary gore? Gore and blood are cool in death-or-alive fights. But in my opinion as a sane and moral citizen, unnecessary gore are just stupid and takes my mind to shitty movies. I can tell you there are gore scenes, a lot of it. In a gun fight, when they blow enemy's head with shotgun and shatters, it is cool, but not when they do it in execution style. And Berandal has a lot of execution style kill\u2014without fight. It's just lame, BIG lame.3. I should admit that once again, Iko and Yayan has done a stellar fight choreos. But in my opinion, there are only four notable fights in the movie: Prison toilet fight, in-car fight, Hammer Girl and Baseball Guy vs Rama, and the final fight. Prison toilet fight is fantastic, and in the end there's no way Iko will win that fight, kind of cool seeing him with all the bruises. In-car fight is a beautifully choreographed fight and combined with a genius scene taking angle makes this scene a masterpiece. Hammer Girl and Baseball Guy delivers a great fast paced fight. I love how comical Hammer Girl is, and I could be wrong here, but I love how Baseball guy combines kenjutsu with baseball basic. And when it is over, it's home-run! The final fight is the deal here. At first the antagonist literally challenges the protagonist in a fair and square pencak silat's sabung (it's like duel for points in martial art championship). Quite entertaining really, and thumbs up for the choreographers. And all the blood and the gore made this fights way epic than any fights in Redemption.4. Yayan Ruhiyan is back!!! I couldn't be happier here, he returned as Prakoso, not the smartest man, but he delivers stellar moves. But well,,, I'm evading spoilers here, but his scenes are epic\u2014if not impossible. 5. Standpoint as an Indonesian. This is where I give thumbs down for Gareth. I wonder if he didn't have a fool proof team. This won't affect non-Indonesian viewer, but I, as an Indonesian really bothered with it. a. The dialogue is cocky, inconsistent, heck most of the time Gareth uses dialogue that will never been used in daily conversation of Indonesian. Like the word \"cinta\" which is \"love\" but we Indonesian only use \"cinta\" in literature use. Never in real conversation. At some points, I really wonder if Gareth made all of the dialogue in English and it went straight to literal translation in Indonesian. I'm still feeling funny when Bejo (the crippled one) says \"Yang saya punya adalah warisan.\" Which I believe Gareth wanted him to say \"I have the Legacy.\" Legacy is translated to 'warisan', but we Indonesian would never use 'warisan' in that context. We view 'warisan' as goods, valuable materials, which passed down from our deceased parents. And the way how each characters dialogue is inconsistent. The use of 'gue' (I, me), 'elo/lu' (you) is highly abused in an inappropriate ways. The formal use of me and you is 'saya' and 'kamu/anda'. This is used when you speak to your boss or someone you respect, while 'gue' and 'elo/lu' are used when you address your playmate or your subordinates. In almost all occasion, Gareth use informal language in a very formal situation. b. Gareth, why do you bring doomsday to the world? Why do you present snow in Jakarta? WTF dude!! Snow in a equatorial country??? That, my friend, is a genius idea,,,,not! c. Indonesia is well known for its gun control policy. And yet I wonder how the mob has a lot of guns\u0085 and shotguns. We may have home mad hand gun, and police issued revolver, but not shotguns,,,let alone semi- automatic uzzi like pistol. And yet every mobs owns them. d. The Character naming is what concern me the most. Why Bangun, a Javanese (tribe) man named his son Ucok, a Batak (tribe) name? And why a man who is an Arab descendant named after a very Javanese (tribe) name; Bejo? It doesn't make sense at all.6. Anyway, I really want to give a high rate for this movie but I couldn't betray my heart. I'll give this movie 6/10.",

And although it is eclipsed by the action more and more, the cinematography, especially those wide shots, ground the film. Blood in the snow (that Fargo vibe), a battle in the mud, just nice imagery all over.The storyline is good (in comparison to other action films very good), and has enough twists to keep the ball rolling. The acting is fine, especially Uwais (Rama) and Pakusodewo (Bangun) do a good job, while Putra (Uco) has his ups and downs. Other characters like hammer girl and baseball bat man that could have easily been overdone actually work really well and carry some badassery.But the core of \"The Raid 2\" are the fighting sequences. There are so many scenes that are just amazing, every fight has its own character, from hammer and bat to the unbelievable final battle that runs for several minutes but never gets dull. The unique feature of this film is the realism in combats and action scenes. With exception of maybe one or to all the stunts are realistic, sometimes even too realistic (that head vs. car door thing was just nasty). The very first fight is far ahead of the bigger part of fight scenes you get to see in cinema, but as it turns out, the combats get even better the longer the film runs.\"The Raid 2\" is easily the best action film of 2014 and one of the best ever.

            "content": "The Raid 2 suffers from the same advertising blunder as Hard Boilded.Although a great action film, as soon as manufacturers plastered \"Better than 300 Die Hards\" on it's cover, Hard Boiled was ruined.Likewise, the moment producers of The Raid 2 called it \"the best action film ever made\" it set the bar of expectation too high.Simply put, it's not as good as the first movie, never mind the best of all time.The first movie stuck to the plus points of the actors and stunt men involved. Story was kept pretty thin, and it focused on some genuinely breathtaking fight choreography and making fantastic use of claustrophobic situations.From the opening sequences of The Raid 2, we experience a few different emotions.During the first 15 minutes you'll experience glee at the first sign of any physical contact, purely for the fact that you are anticipating more of what you saw in the first movie.Then it kicks in....There is far too much \"story\" put into here to get us to the final situation in which Rama has to work his way up a building again. Far too much. And it is not acted out well enough to compete with other movies.The action is tremendous, of course, and saves it every single time. However, rather than benefiting from the open world environment it actually suffers for it. Instead of making use of the limited environment they had in the first movie, we get mountains of fight scenes against goons who all dress the same and put up no resistance, which quickly becomes repetitive.You'll also be amazed by the lack of guns. To the point where it starts to irritate the life out of the movie. It ruins the movie and makes it silly.The Raid 2 does go on to redeem itself, however.The two well built-up \"boss fights\" deliver on all levels and display the kind of ingenious fight work we saw in the first movie in spades. The second of which may just go down as the single greatest martial arts fight ever recorded on film, it is literally perfect.The problem is it's very easy to spot who these \"bosses\" are the moment you lay your eyes on them, because they are the only characters in the entire movie (apart from the two lead actors) who look different and stand out.Iko Uwais needs to learn from the mistake of Tony Jaa and make at least a partial transition into western cinema now.Is The Raid 2 \"the greatest action movie ever made\"?No. Absolutely not.But it is certainly one of the greatest martial arts movies ever made.",

            "content": "When I saw the trailer of The Raid Redemption in 2011 and the accolades it had garnered worldwide irrespective of the fact that no big names were involved in the cast, I knew I had to see it. After seeing it, I was completely blown away. It seemed like I was in Action-movie paradise. The plot didn't seem too complicated, unlike the usual Hollywood action thrillers. But the action scenes were unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Fast, brutal and gruesome \u2013 that's how the action sequences were. I hoped that this would be the movie to lay a benchmark for other possible action films.Come 2014, Gareth Evens returns with a sequel to his 2011 super- hit action flick. If you thought the Raid Redemption was a wholesome and satisfying meal, The Raid 2 is a feast which can satisfy anyone who is a glutton when it comes to action movies. After I saw The Raid 2, The Bourne Ultimatum became my 2nd favourite action movie of all time. That's how amazing this film is. I believe Gareth Evans has created a new benchmark when it comes to action movies and I just hope it inspires other directors and if it happens for real, then I guess action movies will never be the same again.",

            "content": "Indonesian is my mother tongue, that being said, I wish I had lost all understanding of the language for 150 minutes during the show of The Raid 2. To me, the dialogs oddly sounded like (poor) translations of the English subtitle, except those of Roy Marten (Reza), may be because he is such a good actor that he somehow improvised with his lines. All I could think of was that Probably Evans major concern was his English Speaking audience (further showed by that 'calm before the storm' Crazy Snow Fight, there is no way that could happen in Jakarta, Indonesia is a tropical country, no snow here, unless Evans was inserting easter eggs for his future Global Warming Disaster Movie), or probably it was his Indonesian co-writer who sucked. All that said, I wasn't really enjoying the story because of that, still, I could see why storyline-wise The Raid 2 was being compared to The Departed etc, it surely has its potential, it just lacks good script writings is all. On the Actions department however, and this was the main reason we were so pumped to see the movie, sheet.... The Bathroom Stall Fight, the Free For All Mud Brawl, The Car Chase, The Fight Inside the Car of that Car Chase, Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man vs Rama Fight, and the Kitchen Fight! Holly Mother Of God The Kitchen Fight!!! Iko may suck at making faces for drama, but boy can he fight... I love action movies, but not like how cats and dogs love to see moving images on the television, I like action movies with strong story and good acting, say like Django Unchained. I was giving The Raid 2 a Minus 20 rating because its half ass-ed job at script writing but the actions especially the kitchen fight had balanced it off. The actions more than made up for all the lacks this movie might have had, the fights have drama and emotions stronger and more convincing than the dialogs and convoluted plot can deliver. Go see it now.",

The man has some great set of talent in not only making a great film but also in choosing a great cast to carry on the movie. The cast was truly terrific. I absolutely loved \"The Raid Redemption\". My was favorite character from the first part was Mad Dog and i was curious to how the director was going to top the final boss fight in Raid 2. He absolutely blew my mind off by the fight between Iko and Cecep. It's going to go down in cinematic history as one of the best fights ever. The choreography of every action sequence was brilliant. Even the music score was superb. Unlike the first film there is a lot of drama and character development in this movie. It really took a different direction from the previous film. I hope Gareth Evans gets to direct the upcoming Deadpool movie. It would be absolutely epic.",

            "content": "... Too long. the film holds the characteristic of the first with fights, especially towards the end, nothing short of spectacular and exciting and although this time it is attempted to put a more serious storyline I consider this film infinitely long. The plot, cute from a certain point of view, I thought that was confusing and sometimes complex, definitely created as a backdrop for the fights that at the end remain the strong point of the film. As the first in the adrenaline definitely watch it in action scenes will but maybe perhaps at this point I preferred the former as more effective, to hell with the story, honestly despite the fighting could not wait for him to finish. However I can not give a negative vote, indeed, because it still has to be underlined the high caliber of the action present. ultimately I think they tried to do too much to want to create a great product.Recommended only for the usual action scenes.",

            "content": "I was left completely awestruck by the time Rama Says \"no .I'm done\", in this above par martial arts movie \"The Raid 2: Berandal\". A marvelous sequel to the outstanding predecessor The Raid: Redemption\" which was claustrophobically brutal by impounding its story-line and action to just one building all the way through.\"The Raid 2\" inflates beyond that claustrophobic situation, pretty big and sure it does go bigger this time around; with ultra powerful, brutal and punishing action sequences with no clich\u00e9d slo-mo or wire tricks to ruin sheer adrenaline !! The movie starts off swiftly where it was left off in the first installment, with our protagonist, Rama portrayed brilliantly by Iko Uwais, going undercover to weed out the corruption inside his own law enforcement department and also to uproot the Mafia persisting in the sub-urbs of Jakarta. \"The Raid 2: Berandal\" sure has got the same pinch of usual undercover cop story with very familiar elements of \"good cop going bad for the sake of a greater good\" clocking in at about a long two and a half hour mark. Yet, those stupendous action sequences which keep hitting the screen one after the other, from an awesome car chase to one on ones fight duels to \"many on one\" action sequences, make the movie a must watch for any movie lover and not just action fans in particular. Evans directing is simply terrific. Iko is breathtaking with his elegant martial arts moves of Silat; so are the supporting characters and stuntmen., (A quick reminder though, the hammer girl does make you nostalgic by reminding a bit of the Korean blockbuster Oldboy, a homage perhaps \uf04a ) you sure have to make sure that you don't miss, this, mother of all modern martial arts movie (arguably \uf04a ). This does Raid you Brilliantly go for it .!!!",

            "content": "Immediately following the original classic The Raid: Redemption a.k.a Serbuan Maut at its very core, The Raid 2: Berandal ends up establishing itself as a helluva sequel and a more complex expansion to its predecessor. Clocking one hour longer than the prequel, this film adds not only fair portion of drama but also more explosive actions that complexly craft the plot. For people who hate action movies---it's simply a hell; yet, for the rests---it's a paradise of action set pieces.Different from the predecessor's straightforward plot, this sequel is indeed more complex and complicated. The Raid 2 is a crossover of The Godfather and Internal Affairs---involving mob drama and dilemma of undercover cops---with more artistic, pulverizing and bone-crashing action set pieces.Judged as an ultra-violent picture, I found it extremely jaw-dropping as it has already topped action pack in The Raid: Redemption---and it has set the ideal action film to a higher standard that might be difficult to follow.The production design, cinematography, costume design, and scoring realistically rediscover Jakarta and stunningly build the atmosphere of the film. Some new characters look comical, but they have their swagger. There is visible improvement in the acting department; moreover, we can see an ensemble of Indonesian best faces here---an all-star department of young and old generation.Only people who haven't ever seen blood think that this film is not realistic. It has topped the expectation and become a real \"face breaking, ass kicking, neck twisting, hammer hitting, bone shattering film I have ever experienced.\"",

The only thing i can explain is - he loved this movie after we watch it.The fact that the great directing by Gareth Evans will be pointless without help by these 3 actors, and choreographer (Iko, Yayan, and Cecep).

They are not, however, relate-able humans \u2013 this bit disappointed in a \"complete story\" sense. It may have been purposeful, because the target audience isn't interested in, or has become sick of the similar-each-time back stories. This is a work of action, not of action-drama. Clarity and focus appreciated.(+) Fascination with the criminal (under)world. The makers care about this stuff. How sweet. And sweeter that they share it with us.(+) Visual spectacle. Makers have a very tasty sensibility. Chose good spots for the shots. Micro-ing in to particular sensory elements; for example, the villain's leather gloves, very leathery, very dark; the particular red hues of the (Chinese?) restaurant where some meetings occurred. Delightful slivers of atmosphere.(+) A cheeseburger please; not the combo, just the sandwich, thank you. The maker took the standard action hero storyline, then mercifully, surgically sliced out the fat. The romantic side-story, the coming of age process, the personal fulfilment-frustration pendulum; they are all notably absent for the best. The goal here wasn't drama, but action. Action is what you get. And only action done with good sense and better taste.",
