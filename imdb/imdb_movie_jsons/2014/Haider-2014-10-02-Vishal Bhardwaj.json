            "review_title": "A Hauntingly Adept Cinematic Masterpiece",
            "content": "HAIDER to me is an acronym that means the following:H. Haunting. Be it in its background score, music, lyrics, playback (especially Rekha Bharadwaj, Sukhwinder Singh, and Arijit Singh), cinematography, or backdrop of Kashmir in 1995, Haider is Haunting, and how! The film will stay with you long after you have left the theater.A. Astounding. Haider is an astoundingly adept adaptation of a classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective of your knowledge about the Shakespearean Tragedy - Hamlet. If you don't know Hamlet, great! You do? Even better! I. Incredible. Haider is incredible - in terms of its performances. Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul. A terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music, soul stirring performances, and soul warming message.In short - watch Haider - in a theater. For Vishal Bharadwaj, the Director/Composer/Writer. For Shahid, the rising prince. For Tabu the eternal Queen. For Gulzar, the lyricist. For the cinematography by Pankaj Kapoor and the editing by Aarif Sheikh. And finally for Kashmir, the unforgettable voice of humanity.",

            "content": "So, hours after I have finished watching the best movie to have come out this year( by a margin), I am finally in a condition to write anything about it. I am going to stick my neck out and say, Haider is the best work of Vishal Bhardwaj till date. There is no doubt, that for a story driven by passion, revenge, love and power, where emotional dispute forms the core of it, no land other than Kashmir, which has been living under the clouds of dispute ever since, would have been a better choice as the setting for the adaptation. The film is haunting and engrossing. It seamlessly adapts Hamlet and at the same time creates unforgettable characters of its own and makes us see a complex world through their eyes. I can't recall any other film which has completely been shot in the valley and surely none depicting it in all it's glory. The film takes off with the event around which the actions of all the the players of the movie would revolve. One gets only the first hour to get to know the basic nature of the characters as platform for the mind blowing second half is being built. At the cusp of the interval when an ever assured Irrfan Khan makes an intriguing entry, you only get a hint of things to come. The second half unleashes on you Shahid Kapur, who for the first time in his career shows glimpses of Pankaj Kapur. Those three minutes ( you would know which when you watch it ) where Shahid displays what all he is capable of, are those you would want to watch again and again. Kay Kay Menon is now a veteran and he doesn't disappoint.The only weak link to this extraordinary cast could have been Shraddha Kapoor, but she surprises everyone with a very composed yet captivating presence on screen. The heart of the film lies in the eyes of Tabu who makes the movie as deep as the depth of her eyes and as intensely beautiful as her voice. As we hear that Vishal Bhardwaj was not ready to make the film without Tabu, you will believe it once you have watched the film. There is no way you can expect anything short of the best from the dialogues and music, when Gulzar Saab and VB themselves are at helm and they ensure that you do not fall off track even for a moment. A cinematographer can hardly mess it up when you are shooting in paradise. After a brushstroke in Rockstar and a miniature art-piece in Lootera, we get to seethe full painting of Kashmir in Haider. There are enough funny spots in this dark tale of complex emotions,thanks to the fact that Salman Khan had long hair during the period the movie is set. The film has various undertones which were obviously part of the play as well. It would have required a director and screenwriter who is at the peak of his direction and writing skills to have made it happen. The dexterity with which Vishal Bhardwaj has been able to pull it off shows us why he is probably the best in the business in India. I feel, it requires at least another watching before one can completely absorb the enormity of the work that has been created. Salute Vishal 'Bard'waj. Go get Haidered because rarely do you get a chance to read literature on screen.",

            "content": "Less cinematic & more theatrical!This movie seriously has too much! And too much of everything..The psychic-eccentric character of Haider in so many ways resembles Prithvi Bana (Gulaal) and has deeper connotation to the character's get-up & dialogs, some which can stay with us for long and make us get deeper into it every time we check it again!The '3 old men firing snipers' is the best western scene I've seen in Indian Cinema. Sergio Leone feel!The 'Bismil' sequence: Wow! What an achievement in theatrics in cinema! The best theatrical sequence since 'Jaane bhi do Yaaro' I would say! Much more than a song; it is a sequence that gets things out of control and sets the pace of the movie in the second half...'Aao Na Grave-digging' sequence is yet another beauty & I spurted out laughing crazily for some minutes! 'O Brother! Where Art Thou' feel!'Haider Stand-up Performance' is bloody good & gets metamorphic!Emotional turmoil handled in a spectacular way. The confrontation that the characters 'Haider', 'Arshia' & 'Ghazala' face is shown in an epic way\u0085 The confrontation ignited by the dominant society for so-called larger good (haha\u0085)And what if this confrontation is prevalent everywhere in the society around you and there's a very thin line between being a 'friend of the society' or an 'enemy of the society'? Things get out of proportion and messy and sad and brutal and bloody\u0085A brutal take on the Kashmir dilemma. I haven't experienced it in a better way...Super metaphorical mimicry on 'AFSPA' & 'Chutspa'Music that would just perfectly blend & leave deep impression!Power-packed performances make this movie an epitome of talent showcase\u0085 I guess we get such output when the director doesn't compromise at all and expects nothing less than perfection in each aspect, in each sense\u0085 And he eats, sleeps, drinks, thinks, trips just this movie for a very long time in life\u0085 But however he does it, VB delivers something par excellence\u0085 Has to be a super ambitious work!Mile stones in Hindi Cinema: 1. Gulaal & Haider 2. Maqbool 3. Gangs of Wasseypur and so on and so forthRight at the top for now! Wow!",

            "review_title": "A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Vishal Bhardwaj's final chapter in Shakespeare trilogy",
            "content": "Haider is the latest offering from the renowned Indian filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj. Co-written by Basharat Peer and Bhardwaj himself, Haider is the third and final chapter in Bhardwaj's Shakespeare trilogy. Having already made successful adaptations of Macbeth (Maqbool, 2003) and Othello (Omkara, 2006), Bhardwaj was left with the choice of adapting either King Lear or Hamlet to complete his trilogy. He opted for the latter because of the presence of a strong sexual undercurrent in the source material\u2014a motif that harks back to the first two films of the trilogy. The uncanny choice of Kashmir of the 1990s\u2014a treacherous avenue of unparalleled beauty and unfathomable danger where people just disappear, never to return again\u2014as the movie's backdrop proves to be a stroke of pure genius as it helps Bhardwaj in orchestrating an enchanting mise-en-sc\u00e8ne that elevates an otherwise sprawling orgy of histrionics to the realms of realism. By the mid-1990s, Kashmir had taken the form of a like a spewing volcano, a ticking time bomb ready to go kablooey at any given moment. The terrorist insurgency in the Kashmir valley had started to pose a serious threat to India's sovereignty and the army had to be given a carte blanche so as to guard the country against any possible threat from both within and as well as outside the country. The people of Kashmir started seeing the growing military activity in the region as a violation of their basic rights. The separatist leaders saw this as a golden opportunity to galvanize the masses against the state and started adding fuel to fire as the valley got encompassed in a miasma of mistrust. Although, the situation has improved significantly over the last decade, a lot of work still needs to be done before the conflict can be fully resolved. Bhardwaj's film also leaves a strong message not only for people of Kashmir but for all humanity that nothing can be gained through revenge and in the absence of trust.Adapting a work of Shakespeare is no kid's play. Even the most experienced campaigners can falter if their ambition gets the better of them. The key to adapting any major work of literature is to be wary of one's limitations. Haider is far from being called a perfect adaptation of Hamlet. But, Bhardwaj, to his credit, gets the job done. There are moments of sheer brilliance but there is also a lot of drivel which could have easily been chopped off. Haider has all the makings of an epic but it faces some serious pacing issues towards the second half. Also, the narrative appears to be sketchy at some places. But, that's the price that one must be willing to pay for one's ambition. One of the main themes of Hamlet is chaos. This chaos is most evident in the play's central character who, in many ways, is a personification of confusion and duality. His highly complex, fascinating albeit bizarre nature makes him a singular character in all literature, endowed with contradictory traits that fade the lines that separate virtue and vice, heroism and villainy, and sanity and madness. In Haider, Vishal Bharadwaj and Shahid Kapoor try their best to grapple with the endless contradictions that define Hamlet's multidimensional character. Oedipus complex is another major theme that runs through Hamlet. The term Oedipus complex denotes the subconscious emotions and ideas that focus upon a child's desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. In Haider the syndrome is both latent and nuanced in comparison to the play.Haider not only serves as a decent adaptation of Hamlet, but it also proves to be a powerful socio-political commentary on Kashmir of the 1990s. Without the Kashmir angle, Haider would have appeared more empty and existential, with the Shakespearean characters merely playing their parts in a bid to reach the end of the trail. But, with Kashmir as its backdrop, it almost comes across as a propaganda films that aims to serve as a bitter reminder of our not too distant past. Haider is a warning of how easily the youngsters can be brainwashed and led astray by anti-national elements if the state machinery fails to look after them.While the acting is brilliant all around, it is Tabu who steals the show with a multilayered portrayal that would have guaranteed her an Oscar had Haider been a Hollywood production. Shahid Kapoor's performance in Haider is not perfect but is easily the best of his career, and it comes as no big surprise as Bhardwaj has a reputation to get the best out of his actors. Kay Kay Menon plays his detestable part with the desperation of a mangy scoundrel. Shraddha Kapoor serves well as an eye candy, but, beyond that, not much can be said of her acting. Irrfan Khan is brilliant as ever in the limited screen time that he gets. While the entire support cast does a reasonable job, Narendra Jha, who impresses in the role of Haider's father, deserves a special mention.Overall, Haider is a dark, distorted and diabolical work of cinematic art that falls well short of attaining perfection. At regular intervals, Bhardwaj tries to lighten up the mood perhaps to satisfy the cravings of the casual viewers. Needless to say, the movie is technically brilliant: cinematography, editing, and music are all at par with the international standards. The movie has several memorable sequences but the ones that stand out are: Shahid Kapoor's monologue, the sequence in which Haider brutally kills his captors, and the final graveyard sequence which may prove to be a real trendsetter as far as Hindi cinema is concerned. Haider is not meant for casual viewers for it will test their patience to the limit. As far as the intelligent viewers are concerned, the movie offers enough food for thought to keep them engaged. Highly recommended!For more, please visit, A Potpourri of Vestiges.",

He has exploited all his talent in the movie and has left no stone unturned. The other eye catching character is the protagonist's mother and I guess no one could have dine it better than Tabu. She has been a brilliant actress and again proves her mettle here. Kay Kay menon and Irrfan Khan are as always superb. Shraddha kapoor is sweet but does not have much to do. Overall, to go or not to go is not a question at all. It's a must watch and undoubtedly the best movie of year 2014 till now.",

            "content": "The movie Haider, as most of you would be aware of is an adaptation of Shakespeaes' Hamlet. It does help if you have read the original work ,but believe me there is nothing in the movie which you cannot understand if you have not read it.In fact if you have not read it till now,its better because the story would be anew to you. Set in Kashmir it takes the essence of problems faced in Kashmir valley due to insurgency and counterinsurgency measures though it doesn't focus on the problem alone. In a broad sense this movie is about search of a father by a son and subsequent events which leads him nearer towards revenge. First of all the movie is not everybody's cup of tea. You've to be very patient throughout to get the real pleasure out of it. The film is slow paced so as to draw you into it, just like an old wine. And, like an old wine you are supposed to sip it and not drink it in a hurry. The ensemble actor list is itself worth mentioning from Shahid ,Shradhha,Kulbhushan Kharbanda to the talented KK Menon,Tabu and of course the ever reliable Irfan Khan. Their performance is indeed flawless in the movie.The relationships are well portrayed ,the agony and trauma well expressed and the hate ,betrayal ,action scenes well-choreographed and scripted(especially the action sequence in the last scene). The only fault I could find in the acting department is that because of the presence of so many good actors (though the movie has good runtime still) much is left to be desired especially from Irrfan Khan whose performance is too succinct for an actor of his caliber. As said earlier, the movie is slow paced but the script doesn't fail the plot often. There is hardly anytime where you find yourself napping in the movie. Songs are good especially Arjit Singhs voice again creates magic with 'khul kabhi'.Cinematography, background score(which sometimes sound like Bourne trilogy) are also good. Accent training for the actors could have been better as anyone who has visited Kashmir for even a short duration would find only the two Salmaans accent to be genuine. But then it is a minor fault in a movie a cut above rest. If you are patient and could immerse yourself in the plot ,then the movie holds a lot of promise for you. But wont recommend to those who could not find tickets for another movie or those who want to have party time without application of brain.It is certainly not the best work you will ever see, but certainly a cut above rest, deserving a watch.",

            "review_title": "Best movie of 2014",
            "content": "When films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select dialogues, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered \"foreign films\". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and dialogues and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The picturization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider\u2014 a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart-rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare\u2014and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal and timeless tragedy",

Vishal Bhardwaj has taken the source material, re-shaped it to meet the Indian context, and has made the story his own, while at the same time remaining faithful to the original. The story starts with Haider (Shahid Kapoor) returning to his home in insurgency-ridden Kashmir, after his father Hilaal Meer has been taken away by the army for treating an injured militant. Hilaal is a doctor, an idealist who believes in \"being on the side of life, not of ideology\". By the time Haider returns to his homeland, his father has joined the ranks of the \"disappeared\" and the home of his childhood has been destroyed. Worst of all, Haider's mother Ghazala (played by a luminous Tabu) seems to be drowning her sorrow in the arms of her brother-in-law Khurram (Kay Kay Menon). Haider joins the ranks of those Kashmiris desperately searching for their loved ones who have disappeared - seeking his father in hospitals and morgues, turning over blood-drenched bodies in a truck, a sheaf of photocopied photos of his father in his backpack. His childhood sweetheart (Shraddha Kapoor) tries her best to be supportive, but is unable to break through his wall of depression. His depression spirals into rage when he is contacted by a mysterious Roohdaar (Irrfan Khan) who confirms that his father has been killed because of the machinations of Khurram and Ghazala, and that his father's wish was for Haider to avenge his death. From then on, the movie descends into the depths of Haider's thirst for vengeance. The choices he makes, and the consequences of those choices drive the rest of the movie to its inevitable conclusion.Shahid Kapoor plays Haider in the role of a lifetime. His talent, generally obscured by his pretty-boy looks, is in full force here. His eyes mirror his vulnerability and despair, his rage and brutality and eventually his madness. The movie belongs to him. Tabu is Ghazala, glorious as ever. Described as half-widow, half- bride, she does a wonderful job of conveying forbidden obsession and desperation. Her relationship with her son, with their unexplainable passion for each other, is delicately portrayed. Kay Kay Menon is, as always, wonderful as the clownish and somewhat pathetic Khurram, gradually revealing his true face. Irrfan Khan is impressive in his small role as Roohdaar. Vishal Bhardwaj has succeeded in capturing the desolate beauty of Kashmir, once described as \"heaven on earth\". The snow takes on a character of its own, and as Haider spirals into madness and destruction, the snow-filled roads and woods seem more threatening than beautiful. The movie effectively captures the struggle of an entire people, trapped by misplaced patriotism and opposing ideologies. Not an action movie, watch it to see poetry translated to the big screen.",

            "content": "The spoiler warnings don't really apply to those who've read/heard of the bard's 'Hamlet', or its various interpretations. Going in, I really felt this was being released at the wrong time, being sandwiched between quite a few mainstream flicks, and getting around a 5th of the screens to play on (true that). However, that might turn out to be a blessing in disguise, since many don't plan their movie-watching weekend, and might not get tickets to watch the other crapfests that're screening alongside this one.With everything I knew about this going in, I felt that the milieu chosen was quite inappropriate, since Kashmir, and it's clich\u00e9s have been done to death, and VB still wanted to set his supposedly final Shakespearean tragedy here (however, to still give him some of the benefit of doubt, he only scored 'Maachis' for his mentor - Gulzar). Talk about being bereft of ideas. Both he and his mentor Gulzar have used, as their muse, both Tabu, as well as Kashmir and its insurgents one too many times, and I guess one is incomplete without the other, even the mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 combination. Again, not that I'm complaining'. Tabu is the Meena Kumari for this generation, and that's no mean feat in these days of pandering being done by any name-artist worth their craft, where people without a shred of talent are praised for looking good, and looking good alone (c'mon, you know who I'm referring to over here) is sometimes mistaken for acting.To the movie itself now - it looks sumptuous, and you can bet the cinematographer just laid back and let the natural vistas do their job (not to say this would've been easy to shoot by any means). Even for followers of the bard, and audiences of each of the renditions of 'Hamlet', there are a few surprises in store, and that is no mean feat. Quite a bit of credit to the team behind-the-scenes (not all though, since quite a few aspects could've been improved upon \u2013 read on).However, the movie clocks in at least half hour too long (with a runtime of 161 minutes, that too with 3 unnecessary full-fledged Bolly-style song numbers, perhaps from some other mainstream masala flick, thrown into the mix - Kenneth Branagh he ain't). Added to that fatal flaw (since he's trying to make converts of those who've not got their weekend mainstream fix), he loses more of the audience by having characters monologue, and repeat other characters' monologues. To me, each time it happened (and yeah, it happens more than once), I had to have switched off, and quite possibly wasn't in the director's corner at all. One of those instances, a character remarks that another antagonist needs to view circumstances from a different perspective, and that gets echoed again). Corniness is also in the mix, with Irrfan Khan's character's name itself. And what was that with giving him a Rajnikanth-style character intro? Another instance where I switched off, and wanted to cheer as well (which is perhaps what VB was going' for, but once again, a fatal mis-step since it changed the tone of the movie unnecessarily). The biggest mistake of all, IMHO, was the overuse and over-reliance on multiple flashbacks (not talking about all, mind you, since doing that would've alienated almost everyone), instead of letting a few things remain unsaid, thereby effectively deepening few mysteries, while also controlling runtime. However, he goes full Bollywood on us, and gets all exposition-y, the same way a mainstream movie helmer would talk down to his/her audience. OK, One more negative, and I'll stop. In these days when TV series are doing great jobs with CGI and stunt-work, as needed, and blend them seamlessly into the narrative and are effective in their context, the final powerful climax, while overwhelming from a characterization perspective, completely underwhelms in implementation, since the effect it needed to have visually, is a whimper rather than a bang, and once again, completely took me out of the movie (which was sad, since the lead- up to it was absolutely fabulous, and I almost had my heart in my mouth). Now that, is kinda typical in most Indian flicks, and goes with the territory, but considering the expectations I place in VB (along with most of his fan-base, I'm sure), was plain sloppy film- making (how they missed it while editing is anyone's guess, and I can only write it off to excessive self-indulgence, which is also characterized by the overlong runtime).Performance-wise, everyone does a bang-up job, including the controversial casting of the lead, who kinda steps up to the faith that VB had in him. No surprise there, since he was absolutely riveting in the superior 'Kaminey' (yeah-huh), the milieu, of which, IMHO, would have been perfect for this interpretation of the bard's tragedy as well. KK Menon, on the other hand, is not given much to do, in terms of something matching up to his caliber, but he's one of the few people who rises up in spite of that (1 sequence with him post-prayer especially) and delivers something solid and praiseworthy. Everyone else has an author-backed role, and thus have the needed support. All in all, while this is NOT Vishal Bhardwaj's 'Omkara' or even 'Kaminey' (some say it was much, much better than his excessively self-indulgent '7 khoon maaf'), it still calls out to be watched on the large screen, hopefully with a patient audience, who're still gonna be disappointed by it all, or come out only remembering the unorthodox/atypical Oedipus shenanigans. You can bet its much better than tons of mainstream crap out there. I don't mind if he re- interprets more of the bard's works out there, heaven knows more of them need re-telling locally. However, I do hope he reads some of the feedback on this one, takes it seriously, and hopefully goes back to the drawing board for his next effort. Seriously.",

            "content": "Vishal Bharadwaj loves the Bard. And in his third installment, he raises the bar and delivers on brilliant intense but depressing film.Haider, based on Hamlet is the story of young Haider who comes back home to a war torn Kashmir in search of his missing father. However, soon he realizes that his uncle and mother are happy with way things are and no one is interested in finding his father. When the truth is revealed to him, Haider loses his mind and goes for revenge.Firstly, I loved the way Vishal has written the story and the characters. The movie has several scenes that stand out like Haider visiting his destroyed home, Haider addressing the locals in the market area or the climax. Even the scenes with the supporting cast stand out too. A simple scene where Haider's girlfriend is having lunch with her dad who is the top cop. Her dad sweetly tells her not to hide anything from her after knowing that she contacted some terrorist. Another brilliant scenes is the terrific Irfan Khan performing a body check. Watch it to believe it. And check out the two Salman's who are Salman Khan fans.The movie is like terror ridden Kashmir. Its very beautiful but very depressing when terror strikes. There is a lot of blood and gore in the film. You stop counting bodies and the climax is a bit long which made me restless. This brings me to another point. Vishal has taken the Shakespeare adaptation to another level when compared to the previous two. Hamlet like Othello and Macbeth are tragedies. While the previous two films were excellent, they weren't sad and depressing. Haider towards the end made me feel sad. Even my neighboring folks in the hall were restless and passing comments. Not for Haider but the story itself. I wonder how Shakespeare in his grave would look at this adaptation.The performances are simply outstanding. Narendra Jha, who plays Haider's father is outstanding. I've seen this man on serials but didn't know what a hidden talent he is. Kay Kay Menon as Haider's Uncle and Lalit Parimoo as the top cop are class apart. Irfan Khan has a memorable cameo. And, Shahid Kapoor gives his career best performance as Haider. However, like the previous two adaptations, Haider doesn't belong to the main character. If Maqbool belonged to Pankaj Kapoor, Omkara to Saif Ali Khan, Haider belongs to Tabu. A role just written for her, Tabu performance as Haider's mother left me speechless. Tabu is India's finest and underrated actress. She beautifully portrays a loving caring mother, a neglected wife and women seeking love even if it means going for it to her brother in law. Tabu is class apart and you feel for her character Ghazala.Finally, Haider is not for weak hearted and not for those who want a film that relaxes or entertains them. If you love intense films or the Bard, Haider is a must watch.",

            "content": "The movie \"Haider\" proves that Bollywood has evolved and that India has now some bold filmmakers like Vishal Bharadwaj. This outstanding movie with a mind-blowing performance by Tabu deserves 10 stars, but I am holding one star because the movie fails to come off as unbiased and the movie could have done with better editing and zero romantic songs. First, the movie shows a realistic Kashmir - this is not the heavenly Srinagar of old Hindi movies, and the movie realistically depicts one of the problems that the people of Kashmir face. But here the movie should have balanced opinion in order to appear neutral. While the movie clearly shows things as seen with the eyes of terrorists or budding terrorists (Roohdar and Haider) and makes a case for these people to dislike Indian Army, it fails to explain why the Army has to resort to the measures that it does. The movie does not explicitly show the murders and the guerrilla war that the Army has to suffer at the hands of the terrorists. Even when the Army arrests Haider's dad, the doctor, for harboring terrorists in his home, the movie provides the counter-argument that the doctor is on \"life's side\". We then go on to see one of the primary characters, Haider, turn against the Army in search of his dad - and there is little ambiguity here - the filmmaker clearly wants you to sympathize with Haider. The only thing to the movie's credit in this matter is the message of peace borne by the protagonist Ghazala - yes, Ghazala, and not Haider, is the true protagonist of the movie because she plays the upper hand in all events including the climax - Bharadwaj has shifted the center of gravity of Shakespeare's play from Hamlet's dilemmas to Gertrude's mind.Screenplay is mostly perfect but slips at a few places. One of the strongest points of the movie is its ending. The screenplay puts a surprising twist to the Shakespearean drama. In a way, this is the movie's way to try to balance the case it has built for violence and revenge.Direction and cinematography are superb. Editing is also good, except the romantic songs, whose presence in the movie, first of all, I do not know the reason for, but worse, which have been inserted into the movie at the most unfitting moments. They actually end up making the viewer impatient instead of providing any respite.I would give primary credit for the movie to the performances, and above all, to Tabu. Ghazala is heart-breaking and her eyes and facial expressions speak volumes. Lending her full support is Kay Kay Menon in a highly convincing villainous Kashmiri role. Shahid Kapoor, as Haider, is exceptionally good in the second half of the movie, but not so convincing in the first half. The only weak link in the cast is Shraddha Kapoor and clearly stands out as an under- performing novice among veterans - fortunately, she has pulled off her last scene well - which is where her character really matters.All in all, \"Haider\" is a must-see Bollywood affair. It will leave you deeply moved and make you think. However, remember that the movie succeeds in making the case for only one side of the full picture, the main reason it loses one star in my rating.",

            "content": "Films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select duologue's, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered \"foreign films\". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and duologue's and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The pasteurization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider\u2014 a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart-rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare\u2014and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal and timeless tragedy",

            "content": "Macbeth, Othello, and now Hamlet. Vishal Bharadwaj does it once again, by re-imagining Shakespeare in a very gritty Indian milieu. This time it is the Kashmir of 1995 in throes of militancy.The instruments Vishal Bharadwaj used for Maqbool and Omkara, are far sharper this time around. The songs are very rustic, and completely of the type to be found in street plays (not even a symbolic nod to Bollywood or a titillation to the audiences with a Bidi). The sense of suspense even sharper (even with a story with a basis as well known as Hamlet). The characters continue to be just as eccentric as in Omkara. And death once again continues to be not an infrequent visitor just like with Omkara. Yet the context is more sombre. And the whole scenario of militancy IMO dealt with quite responsibly with (what I would imagine to be) a good sense of reality.Not everything is wonderful. On the acting front, Tabu is impressive but understated. Shahid Kapur does well by his standards, but every so often I used to wonder how much better Pankaj Kapur would've done in some of the scenes. Shraddha Kapoor manages the role of pretty innocence well enough, but will probably cringe when she watches her own histrionics. Kay Kay Menon, and Irfan Khan of course are a pleasure to watch, but this is not their best film. While the songs aim to dramatise, I found them underwhelming and unnecessarily melodramatic in this context, Also the film is just a tad too long and could've been shortened by 15-20 minutes.Be prepared to see a Kashmir which does not look the swiss alps but still deserves to be considered amongst the most beautiful places on earth. This kashmir is a little raw. And forms the milieu for two concurrent threads, one the intra family drama which is the very essence of Hamlet, and the general environment of militancy and counter insurgency. Moreover the plot moves at a fairly measured pace and manages to retain the interest and fascination. It might surprise you (after my earlier paragraph), but these are the reasons why I would classify the movie to be a must watch.Yeah, go watch this, this is not to be missed, any complaints you might've notwithstanding.",

Though stated as an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, it forced us to look at the Kashmir issue from a different perspective. It asks us to look beyond the nationalist notion- 'my country;right or wrong'. The first half was brilliantly told as the story unfolded amidst the back drop of snow laden mountains of Kashmir. The place is really surreal although the bone of contention between the two nations side it first came into being. The second half begs you to pay close attention to every word, every action and every nuance since there is a delicate play of treachery and blind love at work. They say a woman's heart holds a thousand secrets and here comes our indispensable Tabu. To Haider she is a mother he loves the most and to Khurram, she is a secret lover. The story develops amidst the Kashmir insurgency and puts the laws of the land to question. There are scenes that you are bound to remember for a long time because of the sheer despair of situations, or the acting by the protagonist- Haider. This movie has inspired me to read Hamlet and that is the true indicator of how well the movie was made. I walked out hoping the movie didn't end when it did.

            "content": "Haider is not a masterpiece or that perfect film that will hound the top hundred list of cinema. But it still should be cherished and celebrated for, keeping in mind the sleaziness that seem to pass off as entertainment in Bollywood nowadays. Even if we remove the poor excuse of Bollywood that I always seem to make to boost the credentials of the movie and see it as an individual identity in the world cinema, Haider has enough to stand on its own feet.As everyone would have known by now that Haider is an adaptation of a play by William Shakespeare, Hamlet that is actually a four hour play and the longest of Shakespeare's plays. It is considered by many to be character oriented than plot driven. Thus, adapting Hamlet has always been a tough nut to crack for many of the filmmakers who have been adapting it since the birth of cinema, and kudos to Bharadwaj for having the balls to do so. And particularly in Bollywood where masala films are the trend. The strain of the monstrosity of the task undertaken is do seen in places where the story becomes shaky, stretched and clunky and particularly with one romantic song that the movie would have done better without.But let us not keep to the flaws, when the good that movie does is just magical and many. Firstly, it is a brilliant integration of the play into the sociopolitical climate of Kashmir that it never seems for once to be a foreign play adapted in Indian settings. And the characters seem as they have always belonged in the beautiful valley. I had my doubts about Shahid being casted as Hamlet aka Haider, but the sheer brilliance of Shahid Kapur melted away all my apprehensions. Tabu unlike the play's Gertrude is given a much meatier character and screen time, and she does justice to it with her dexterity. Bharadwaj has been very bold and it became evident in the first half hour of the movie when in a flashback an adolescent Haider kisses Tabu on the neck and the camera zooms on the gesture. It is then you realise that Bharadwaj is not going to leave out one of the most discussed aspect of Hamlet- Oedipus Complex. And his boldness is shown comradeship in the silent, lingering sensuality of Tabu's character that simmers subtly with the motherly affection and heartbreak. Kay Kay Menon is the sly fox who marries Tabu after the death of the Shahid's father. And he is a phenomenal thespian.The story is set against the backdrop of unrest in Kashmir and the entire story through its characters aim to recount the suffers and toils of its people and the vicious cycle of revenge and violence that seems to spare no one. It is one huge politico-social allegory that not only have direct references to the issues at hand, but also each character serves as an allegory for the players in this game of interminable violence. At the centre of the story there is a complex entanglement of love, betrayal, treachery and jealousy that threatens to tear apart the very peace they wish for. And at the centre of this web is Haider- a poor soul, torn between love, jealousy and revenge and slowly descending into madness.What I love about Vishal Bharadwaj is that he is a man of vision. You can assuredly rest your faith in the fact that his love for cinema makes him unsusceptible to the allures of money and he is going to deliver a cinema that he believes in. The only problem with such people is that they are consumed not with mediocrity, but the unquenchable thirst of their ambition. And the fewer flaws of the movie stem from this. There are many amazing scenes in the movie that are paisa wasool. The song that Shahid Kapur sings, retelling the whole conspiracy, to see the reaction of his soon to be step father is a very brilliantly choreographed scene that is powerful and evocative, true to the nature of play that Hamlet choreographs in the Shakespearean play. The joker Haider plays under the tree was superb one man act. Simply brilliant. The ending scene with snow marred with dead bodies, graves and blood holds an imagery that will stay long with me. The gravediggers scene at the end is surreal and in some way denote the madness that is slowly enclosing Haider, or the impending doom. It was done fantastically. Loved that part.Haider is powerful cinema. The imagery, the sound, the acting, the dialogues all mix to create an experience that is haunting and captivating. Haider was never meant to be entertaining. It is one hell of a head trip into the mind of a state that is plunging deeper into madness, caught in the interminable cycle of hate and revenge.",

You could really feel the tension that the people suffer at the border. The cinematography is quite good. The story line is just awesome and the Tabu and Shahid give top notch performances but still Tabu has a tougher role to play so considering that she was the best among the lot. Kay Kay Menon does not perform upto his standard, but still he is good. Now coming to the bad points which I found a lot but it could be compromised. Basically the initial portions are too melodramatic. The plot advances slowly even without giving proper insight. Those could have been enhanced. Shraddha Kapoor was a serious let down. She would destroy a serious scene with her funny accent. The love song was completely unnecessary that could have been replaced with something more meaningful. The second half was more powerful. With the film changing its tome to more of aggressive nature. The Bismil song was well suited to the scene. I had goosebumps during that song. Sukhwinder Singh hats off for that song. Tabu was simply awesome in the second half. And the end was simply marvelous. As a whole I would ask the people out there to check this movie out because you rarely such heart touching and self examining movies.",

The vehicles used by the Indian Army in 1995 were not the ones soldiers use in the movie. The stars on the collar dogs for Brigadiers and above were introduced in 2000s and a Brigadier (portrayed by Ashish Vidyarthi in the film) couldn't have worn them in 1995. Indian Army didn't have a RPG-7 in its inventory and the RL-84 Rocket launchers that it used never set buildings to fire.Contrarily, Amjad Rasheed, owner of Distribution Club, previously known as IMGC Entertainment, shared why the film wasn't taken to provincial censor boards for clearance after it was refused certification from CBFC. \"We realize the gravity of the situation at the Line of Control and if one board has refused to certify the film, then the wise thing to do is not to offer the film at all,\" said Rasheed, whose company was set to import Haider in Pakistan.The contradiction in comments from CBFC and the film's distributor suggests that the film wasn't going to be released in Pakistan in the first place. That the delay in bringing Haider to Pakistan could have been an orchestrated move on part of the Distribution Club, which also distributed box-office behemoth Bang Bang and spy-thriller Operation 021. With Bang Bang's high commercial quotient and Operation 021's 'Shaan' factor expected to supersede Haider's intricate narrative, the film would have not generated sufficient collections at the box office had it been released at that time. The distributor's interest in releasing Haider two weeks late could have dwindled further due to the film being readily available on DVD and played on cable television throughout the Eid season.",

I don't think we have any praise left for Tabu, KK and Irrfan. They are marvelous. Now Haider! Well I have seen Hamlet, as Kenneth Branagh comes pretty close to actual play. Its such a mammoth. I love Hamlet's soliloquy and thats what makes Hamlet good for me. Now Haider has that missing and whatever little was there was a bit disjointed. Initial part of movie is pretty weak, Shahid's performance in first half is very ordinary. Things change in second half, and Shahid has done a splendid job. Movie suddenly gets on with business and breathes again. I did not find Haider's descent into madness that convincing at all. I think VB still bit a more than he could chew. In past he has done brilliant and perfect job of taking these plays and making them even better and more desi. But this time, it did not work that well. So I have rated movie at 6/10, although 6.5 but that was not possible on this IMDb scale. Btw best thing about movie was Bismil song and Aao Na, I wish there were more of these.",

Several films have depicted the beauty of Kashmir, but only a few touched the pain lying in the valley. Vishal goes for both, the beauty and the pain. At this age when no filmmakers take a chance to touch the sensitive arena of patriotism, Vishal Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer comfortably takes a hit on AFSPA, making it equivalent to Chutzpa (a Hibru word). It's a brave expression. The story of Haider is built around how the people of Kashmir think, contradictions among themselves, their pain and yet it doesn't disturb you like Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday or something of that sort. Yes, the story is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet, but it's not just a mere adaptation of that story, it has so many ingredients that are very original. The screenplay flows like the nazm of Gulzar, although written by Vishal and Basharat. This is not just a story of revenge, it's a story of helplessness, love, life and rebel. it hits hard on the drama of democracy. Despite being dark, the film remains bright. Exquisite cinematography, Marvelous background score, soul- satisfying music, and excellent individual performance (be it acting or singing) transform this film into an absolute experience. And then the special appearance of Irrfan Khan moves the film into top gear. I was thrilled at the interval, and I am sure, you'll be too.",

A film that doesn't flinch. Is Haider Vishal Bhardwaj's best film? Vishal Bharadwaj brings alive the ecstasy, pain and passion of Hamlet on screen, he also reminds us of the harsh truth in our own backyard, the man-made mayhem in the God-made jannat that is Kashmir.

So he makes the story his own while at the same time keeping true to the spirit of the original. He adds many layers to this complex saga of emotions which draws the viewer in and doesn't let go till the final frame. Spectacular cinematography and soulful music enhance the experience of watching the epic drama unfolding on screen. Story is watertight without any loopholes and the dialogues are pure brilliance. The strongest part of the movie is the acting by the superb star cast. Shahid Kapoor finally gets a role which he deserves and he simply sears the screen with his intensity. Tabu is top-class as always and is the backbone of this movie and proves yet again how much we lose when she does so little work. Kay Kay is also in full form as he shows what a brilliant actor he is when given the right role. Shraddha Kapoor looks the part but has a long way to go in the acting department. Even the actors with less screen time like Narendra Jha, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and \"2 Salmans\" leave a strong mark. And of course, Irrfan Khan in the most sensational special appearance ever. And above all this technical and creative artistry is the Master himself, Vishal Bhardwaj, the director, who oversees this extremely difficult subject and delivers a Tour de Force of a movie.",

            "content": "I have watched both Maqbool and Omkara, and both were as stunning as the literature masterpieces they are based on.Vishal Bhardwaj has restored the faith in Bollywood. Time and again, he has managed to use his unparalleled chutzpah in filmmaking and bring out the best in his characters and the actors who play them. It would be an understatement to describe his latest venture as celluloid art, because Haider not only flashes stellar performances, direction and score-soundtrack, it defines them. If Haider was to be reviewed and analyzed properly, and yet depicted in few words, I'd say: \"Movies gain cult following only years after they release, but Haider does it in hours.\"The main themes are aplenty, but what intrigued me is the thread of sexual conflict that is rampant and clear in Bhardwaj's Shakespearean trilogy. Omkara was better when it comes to it, but Haider does have its share. Thank Tabu for her enigmatic performance as Ghazala, a mother torn between three men she so credulously believes in. She is the central character and the fountain of plot points splashes from her. Her son Haider (Shahid Kapoor) transforms into a creature after he learns about the ill that played in his Kashmiri family while he was away learning poetry. He then embarks on a journey filled with betrayal, lust, love along with other emotions, terrorism, and insanity. The climax is a perfect rendering conclusion to the eclectic prelude. It is sure food for thought as the titular character reasons with his metamorphosed and troubled mind, and dives into unforeseen solitary.The writers have used two main under-themes: 1995 Kashmir conflict and ASFPA Act (salute to Irom Sharmila). They loudly beckon the audience closer to understand the story it tries to narrate. With a rapid use of non-linear storyboard, Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer succeed in impacting. With the first frame it is evident what lies in the photography. A landscape of Kashmir in the last decade of 20th century as it bears tumult and tension opens the film and what closes it is the aftermath of both, fiction & non-fiction.The best thing about Haider is the score and its timing. If it were not for the music, songs and background, Haider would've been a mortise locked cocoon of fiber. The garage rock, electronic rock, and elements of gospel music haunts the viewer and along with the pictures they are performed on, your goose-bumping stimuli are sure to get tired. Every time a chord is to be hit in a scene, the music commands it with a beat or a catch or a riff, which enables us to think simultaneously as to what might have led the character to do what it did. Brilliant. Pure brilliant, is such use of score and melody.Shahid Kapoor exemplifies character portrayal, how he administers the role which takes heavy banging (ah, Hrithik's Bang Bang is so inferior at the moment) throughout 160 minutes. It may sound easy when your co-actors are so experienced, but Kapoor shows his maverick side of acting (definitely inherited from his father) with Haider. Shraddha is for the first time good and there is this small speck of tinkle in her portrayal as Haider's lover. The love scenes look original and readily gather moss. I will be ever charmed by Kay Kay Menon and in here he deserves my admiration for his elastic expressions that say more than his physical show. Tabu, like I said shares the limelight with Menon and Kapoor. Irrfan Khan, one of my favorites, is introduced with a piece of music as mystifying as his character build-up. Songs and their enacting is par excellence. While the romance between Kapoors may add seam to the film, I was in awe with one particular song, \"Bismil.\" If you observe closely, it outlines the story in five minutes, so the ignorant folks (fans of Salman Khan films or the ones who are all anticipating Farah Khan's Happy New Year) could get an idea what and how a film is made.Editing is very good and so is the cinematography. But I wonder if the film could've been cut short by few minutes, especially when there is an attribute of monotony in the second half. The final 15 minutes will keep you at the edge of the seat because it has gunshots, grenades and absolution. If someone swirls the magic wand and does manages to find a dull moment in the film, then it will be nullified the next second, because Haider tells a story with so much emphasis and panache, you will leave the theater hall visualizing the sequences and feeling bad for the characters, because we all know, and if you don't know then you should, that it is all tragedy. Shakespeare was a genius and so is...! Who (all)? You decide!BOTTOM LINE: Just the best film to come out from Bollywood this year. We have 3 more months to go, but I'm positive and the only competition it has is from Hirani's P.K.. Lets see.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Stumbling on a news report about there being a court case in India that was attempting to stop the movie coming out on DVD over there,I was happy to discover that the UK DVD of the title was due to come out in 3 days time,which led to me getting ready to finally meet Haider.The plot:Returning home after the sudden disappearance of his dad Dr. Hilal Meer during a shoot-out over the separatism of Kashmir, Haider Meeris is surprised to find that instead of being desperate to locate him,his mum Ghazala Meer appears to be having a jolly old time with her brother in law Khurram Meer.Learning that his dad was taken for questioning by the military,Haider gets into contact with a mysterious stranger called Roohdar,who tells Haider that both he and his dad were tortured in a detention camp,which Hilal claimed he was placed in,thanks to Khurram being an undercover informant.Taking a closer look at Khurram and Ghazala's relationship,Haider begins making plans on getting revenge for their betrayal. View on the film:From the opening of the film,the score from composer/singer/co- writer (along with journalist Basharat Peer)/directing auteur Vishal Bhardwaj becomes deeply entwined with the unfolding tragedy being underlined by the industrial hum of Bhardwaj's score unleashed an extremely strong atmosphere of impending slowly covering the landscape of Kashmir.Keeping away from including any songs designed to make the soundtrack a chart topper,Bhardwaj emphasises the feelings expressed in the score,by making each of the songs (one of which is sung very well by Bhardwaj) lay bare sections of Haider's personality that are about to fall over the edge.Filmed entirely on location in Kashmir over 2 harsh seasons, (with the first section being shot during the late autumn season of November-December 2013,and the final part of the title being completed during a freezing winter season of January-February 2014)Bhardwaj and cinematographer Pankaj Kumar beautifully open every wound that the battle scar city has suffered.Placing Haider in a corrupt world filled with death & betrayal,Bhardwaj and Kumar give the first half of the title a stark,washed out appearance,whose clarity increases with Haider sets his eyes towards those who betrayed his dad. Casting a suffocating Film Noir shadow across the title,Bhardwaj & Kumar steam the darkness out of the screenplay by covering the screen in mountains of snow,which along with showing the coldness inside Haider,also reveals the destruction of purity in Haider's loved ones,as their blood turns the snow a frosty red.Collaborating with journalist Basharat Peer, (writer of the highly- praised book Curfewed Night: A Frontline Memoir of Life, Love and War in Kashmir)Bhardwaj and Peer make their modern take on Shakespeare's dialogue one that never feels gimmicky,but precise,and perfectly fitting with the decay that infects Haider.Avoiding any option of taking the film in an easy Bollywood melodrama route,the writers cast a critical eye over Kashmir,with Haider's revenge tale being used in a mature allegorical manner to show the recurring acts of violence that take place across the Kashmir boarder.Bringing a fresh-face Haider back to Kashmir,the writer's strike the film with a tremendous intensity,with Haider's relationship with his family being closely examined ,which allows for the gaps in the relationships to be exposed to a brittle sunlight.Peeling away Haider's levels of sanity,the writer's keep an unflinching eye on showing Haider's toxic revenge engulf all signs of humanity that he possessed.Shimmering across the screen,Tabu gives a remarkable performance as Haider's mum,with Tabu showing Ghazala to have a closed-in nature to her surroundings,which leads to Tabu showing the hope on Ghazala's face that Haider is still her little boy.Bringing the Oedipus complex in Ghazala and Haider's relationship,Tabu keeps away from any over dramatic notes to instead express Ghazala feelings about her son entirely through body language,with every gesture that she makes towards Haider lingering that little bit too long.Turning down (along with Vishal Bhardwaj) his wage so that every penny could be put on screen, Shahid Kapoor gives an extraordinary,trans-formative performance.Entering the film rather innocently,Kapoor makes Haider's desire to avenge his dads death an idea whose grip intensity's,as Haider feels his dad's shadow wrap around in,as he looks with new eyes at everyone who he has ever known.Sliding Haider into insanity,Kapoor wisely keeps the ghost in Haider's life on his shoulders,so that no matter how psychotic the character gets,his roots are always laid bare,as Haider wonders to be, or not to be.",

Talks of ghost ids, demilitarization of the state, the plebiscite that never happened are all issues mainstream cinema probably have never even heard of. Bhardwaj conjures up a heart wrenching tale of betrayal, loyalty, love, angst, pain and a man torn between them all. I am sure no one except Vishal could have stayed so true to Hamlet and made something so different from it. The performances are top notch but what works the best about Haider is its unpredictability. Even if you are fluent with Hamlet, there will be a lot you can take away from Haider. I guess, this film is the best all those who are associated with it can get. Haider is an unforgettable film that never fumbles, never stumbles, and is so sure of itself that it cannot go wrong. From Shahid to Tabu to Kay Kay to the powerful cameo of Irrfan, everything in the film works. It's a Guztaq film that audaciously breaks every rule in the book, everything that you could have expected from it and ends up being that edgy watch which you'll savor, while you watch it from the edge of seats. Performances. When it comes to performances, everyone is on the same page in this film. Shahid Kapoor brings out his genetic brilliance and gives an ace performance Shraddha Kapoor as Oephilia or Arshiya as in the film, is great. Beautiful, innocent and smooth. Tabu brings her own to Gertrude. She plays Ghazala with flair and have a haunting quality to her silence. When her son tells her she has two faces, the heartbreak shows on her face. Her beauty is such in the film that it reflects her state of mind. Kay Kay Menon is far away from his last few stints and gives Claudius (Khurram) his own color. I loved how his demeanor shifted in the presence of different people.",

            "review_title": "harder Best film of the year",
            "content": "2014 When films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select dialogs, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered \"foreign films\". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and dialogs and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The vectorization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider\u2014 a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart- rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare\u2014and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal and timeless tragedy",

            "content": "Simply put: Do not see. Or see it. Or see it on TV later. This film is not worthy of such discussion.FOR THE PEOPLE FROM KASHMIR (1). For people from Kashmir, who are looking for some authenticity in the storyline; I am sorry to say that the situations are mostly contrived. The objective is to create pathos for the hero of the film. So, the army is shown as the aggressor in a vacuum and its actions as the instigators for the common man. Many times, the people who fund such propaganda/ political movies have their own agendas and it appears to be very much the case here. There are other objectives and those are from the political leanings of the well-known, separatist-sympathizing, script-writer Basharat Peer. (2). In reality, the anti-terrorist local force, Ikhwan was made more from the people who had been wronged by the terrorists and not from turncoat terrorists. The cause and motivation of these Ikhwanis is not explained as such. The horrors and miseries of the terrorists (many of them being non-Kashmiris from Pakistan and Afghanistan) upon the common man and women, which created Ikhwanis, are not shown. Ikhwanis are shown as mercenaries under the guidance of the Army but Ikhwanis were actually the ones who had earlier been wronged and tortured by monster terrorists and that was their motivation against them. In the film, this Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen is deliberately called the Ikhwan-Ul-Mukhbareen. The subtlety in changing the nomenclature should not be lost on you if you are from Kashmir. The History of Kashmir and the names of places in Kashmir are being rewritten with an agenda and the story of the Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen seems to have been rewritten with the same agenda. (3). For Kashmiri Hindus, half a million of whom were forced into mass exodus, there is barely any mention and no background is provided about them. The script writer/ movie maker sees that if it was done, you could not develop pathos for any terrorist and Haider eventually is just a terrorist. (4). In the future, if a writer were to actually weave all the subplots (Kashmiri Hindus, What the army was up against, Torture of Locals by the Terrorists, Reasons for the Ikhwan, Role of the rich and the famous and the well off from among the Kashmiri Muslims \u0085.) into the narrative, it will be a hell of a story. Haider is not.FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON KASHMIR (I will stick to facts) (1). There were 2 rows occupied in the entire hall. 1 row was occupied by people of Kashmiri origin and their friends. (2). The people in the row behind the Kashmiris were fidgety after the first 20 minutes of the movie. They would walk out and walk back in. I am not sure how many stayed for the length of the movie. (3). The story is supposed to be adapted from Hamlet. During the portions of the movie that touch the Hamlet storyline, one could only hear guffaws and lack of inclination towards the film. (4). During what should have been the most touching scenes and songs, people kept casually leaving their seats to fetch popcorn, to ease their heads, to take a break\u0085 (5). After the movie, during the follow-up dinner, I asked some of the non-Kashmiri friends what they thought of the movie. They are open-minded, liberals and what you will call very secular. They did not believe the storyline was as much about Kashmir as it was about Haider and his conflicting/ unclear emotions for his mother and her undeclared, under the covers relationship with his uncle. Unfortunately, this portion of the story and the inter-relationships of the people were not developed well because the script-writer/ filmmaker chose to cover the Kashmir issue way more than required. The movie therefore became a hotchpotch. Even without any background, the non-Kashmiri people in the audience did not believe that the story was anywhere close to the truth. It was just their feeling about the story, even if it had been fact. The problem was that the script-writer/ film-maker tried too hard to thrust their emotion on the audience and that fact had not been lost. Think of a salesman trying too hard to sell to you and your reaction! (6). Their rating for the movie ranged from 1.5 to 2. They said that if they did not know that it was based on Hamlet and if it was an original story, they may have rated it 2.5.CONCLUSION This movie is not a game-changer or a piece of history for anyone. You can safely watch it now, ignore it, watch it for free on TV later, save your time and do something better \u0085..(1). It will not appeal to the young Muslims because they know that it is not the truth. They are up against an incredible amount of propaganda anyway and if they have to be affected, it will be due to that propaganda than due to this movie. (2). The Kashmiri Hindus will know that this is a lop-sided story. They should not worry that general people (other Indians, an international audience \u0085 ) will believe in this being a statement of truth. (3). The remaining audience finds the movie to be only moderately entertaining (for art, visuals, drama, suspense \u0085 ) but certainly not a reflection of truth.",

Yesterday I watched Haider and I really thought its a film lost in its narrative, a film not clear with its motive. Here are some of my points why I didn't like the film the way everyone's been raving about.1. Overly long film, could have easily edited the part about love story, why the hell would one like to listen to a song where the hero who was just in a maniacal depression due to his father's death, dance stupidly around trees for love, loses the credibility of the whole flow. The scene about he going around searching for his father with flyers is unnecessarily long and over dramatic. The song sequence in Kay Kay and Tabu's marriage was another commercial trapping for a realistic film as this one could have been.2. What was the purpose of the speech that he gave in the middle of the road? The speech seemed like the director deliberately inserted to have a solid impression of Shahid's acting otherwise around 100's of people listening so quietly to a layman is a another Bollywood style where the actor is actually the hero, no matter what.3. The film has many commercial trappings like the time when he's about to kill Kay Kay Menon and the police come at the exact right time and spot, the police spots him in the fire torn building when he's about to cross border at the exact right time and spot. Funnily a country where the police is never on time here co-incidences lead them to them to the points without any prior information.4. Why did Kay Kay not have him caught while he was singing the song and dancing, may be he was mesmerized like everyone else by his moves.The only thing good about the film is Pankaj's Cinematography and Tabu's acting.",

Same feeling, with much more love, was felted by me during watching Vishal Bhardwaj's Haider, an adoption of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Basically, the combo of Vishal and Gulzar had created many wonderful projects, but, in very complicated way. Haider also has some unique factors which can not be easily accepted by all classes. So, this film is strictly for Vishal Bhardwaj's fan who have patience while watching the movie. Because, the first half is little bit slow as they have to show the characters and their lives. But, when Irrfan Khan entered in the film, the movie went on a full speed motion. Haider which is played by Shahid Kapoor, may definitely be won best actor award this year. I liked the totally bald look of him. He is just tremendous in those 2-3 minutes. Awesome! Tabbu acts really really well, she fits in her role perfectly. Kay Kay Menon is as usual good. Irrfan Khan has great screen presence. Even Shahid's entry may not get shouts from the audience but Irrfan makes them to shout. Shradhha looks promising. She is also good in most of the part. The actor who played the father of Haider is also good. Vishal Bhardwaj gave the music. All songs are my favorites. But, during the film, Bismil & Jhelum are extraordinary. Then Aao Na and Khul Kabhi is good ,too. Gulzaar is a master of lyrics. No one can beat him or his poetry. No doubt in the direction, dialogues or screenplay, because all of these are handled by Vishal himself. Kashmir is also one of the characters. Jhelum river, Baramulla bridge, the beautiful valleys and Indian Army - everything plays a perfect role to lift the movie to very high level. \"Lahu Lahu Waqt Ka Khun Hua Re...Lahu Behta Angara...Sooraj Dooba Kin Aankhon Mein...Jhelum HuVa Khaara...\" I'm not giving any stars to the film, because who love good cinema they will surely go.

            "review_title": "Haider is intense, disturbing, and not your regular Bollywood movie",
            "content": "The movie tells the story of Haider (Shahid) who finds out that his peace-loving, life-saving doctor father (Narendra Jha) has been arrested by the Indian Army. He returns from Aligarh (where he was studying poetry, a passion he shares with his father) to realize that his mother (Tabu) and uncle (Kay Kay Menon) are behind a conspiracy that resulted in his father's disappearance.We have seen in Maqbool and Omkara how wonderfully Bhardwaj takes up the bard's plays and weaves them passionately into a completely different cultural milieu. With Haider, Vishal does better. The film paints Kashmir in a haunting colour, so true to the troubles there. The usual whites and dark hues of frames are there in the Valley (usual in cinematic sense when you portray dark emotions) but even the gleeful frames blaringly outline the feelings of revengeful, hurt and disturbed souls.Bhardwaj and Kashmiri journalist Basharat Peer co-wrote the film's screenplay and they must be praised for their courage to speak strongly about what is happening in Kashmir. Haider goes beyond Bollywood's Pakistan bashing for Kashmir's troubles and speaks about the alleged atrocities of the Indian Army on Kashmiris. Haider jokes about 'chutzpah'--pronounced as 'chootspaa' in the movie--and equates it to AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act, the security law which gives armed forces immunity from prosecution while operating in the militancy-hit areas but has been criticised by human rights groups).As for performances, Vishal Bhardwaj brings out the best of Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor, a journalist in the movie. Shahid looks a little out of place in the beginning but the traumatic role rubs onto him with time. Shahid's acting in Haider could well undo his several Bollywood mistakes , Tabu plays the role of a traumatised and hurt soul who is searching for peace and love wonderfully. Kay Kay Menon is mesmerising with his menacing and conniving looks. Narendra Jha is impressive as the doctor who in his bid to save lives ends up being branded as a militancy supporter. Even the smallest of characters, faces that appear just for a shot, impress you as much as the actors with full-fledged roles. In one scene, Shahid meets an old woman at a government office where they have both come searching for their missing family members. The woman shows the picture of a young man and Shahid shows his father's picture: the traumatised-and-caring look on the woman's face as she touches Shahid's head is striking.Bhardwaj picks the drama of human follies from Shakespeare's works and places them in a completely different scenario, but he stays true to the emotions of the bard's works. The director ensures that the emotions of a troubled soul (Haider), subtle sexual undertones of the mother-son duo relation, the eternal human follies of treachery and adultery are showcased on the canvas of his cinema.The music and background score go hand-in-hand with the narrative and scaringly haunt you throughout. The romantic number Khul Kabhi To seems a bit misplaced and is distracting. The ending to the song, however, brings you back to the traumatised cinematic experience that Haider is.Watch the film for Vishal Bhardwaj's direction, dialogues and touching acting prowess that almost everyone in Haider shows. Skip it if an intense, disturbing film is not your cup of tea or if entertainment is what you seek at movie theatres.",

            "content": "It turned out to be not a film depicting the plight of the Kashmiris but rather a retelling of Hamlet with the beautiful Kashmir in the background the internal squabble as the country as its backdrop. Even though the movie makes it appear as though there is just bloodshed, guns and terrorism in this snow-covered paradise on earth, much of its past history remains untold.People tend to assume Kashmir had always been a Muslim majority country where India is trying to exert its influence, but its citizens want out. There are much more than meets the eye.Kashmir was a revered place from time immemorial for seekers of knowledge and epistemology. It was the destination for many sages the world over. Hinduism, Shiva Taitrism, planted itself firmly here as early as 3rd century BCE. The populace was considered highly literate and skilled. The turning point came in the form of invaders. A particularly Muslim ruler by the name of Sikander Bhutshikan (1394-1417), an iconoclast, was hellbent on destroying non-Islamic symbols and enforced widespread proselytisation. Naturally, the Hindu Pandits escaped in droves to other parts of India and Kashmir became a Muslim-dominant country. Many Hindus remain closeted, only outwardly Muslims.King Ranjit Singh united Punjab, Afghanistan, Kashmir all the way to Tibet, but his successors lost Jammu and Kashmir to the East India Company in the first Anglo-British War in 1846. The British started the Hindu Dogra dynasty. It was Hari Singh, its descendant, who was the King of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 who decided to join neither India nor Pakistan. It stood an Independent sovereign state.Trouble started soon after Independence. Pakistani troops masquerading as Pashtun tribal groups infiltrated into Kashmir to take over the country. The 1st Indo-Pak war started when Maharajah Hari Singh asked for help and agreed for ascension into the Indian Dominion. The battle, however, ended in a deadlock with India controlling a third of the country and Pakistan the other third.Sheikh Abdullah was appointed the head of Jammu and Kashmir by Nehru. He had earlier led a rebellion against Hari Singh was had been imprisoned before. Sheikh ruled the state with special powers accorded to him via Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. His reign was marred with many insurgencies, Islamisation pogroms and terrorist activities with help from Pakistan. There were hardly any economic activities or development, but only a high tension volatile environment. More Sikhs and Hindus exited from their ancestral land seeking a better life since the 1980s.Many talented writers now settled elsewhere, have penned their doggone experiences in Kashmir in many of their heart-wrenching writing set in their once serene homeland. With the aberration of Article 370, India hopes to bring development and a semblance of peace in the region. Unfortunately, foreign media keeps stirring undue tension and anxiety amongst the people of the area to keep up their sales.",

Its the perfect portrayal of Shakespeare's poetic beauty in to a chilling and burning Kashmir of 90s. The movie stirs you from inside and even when you are out of hall , you are wandering into Kashmir, facing their problems and experiencing their fear. I have been a fan of out of the box movies and Haider is a rare piece of art in Indian Cinema. the cinematography is perfect. it bounds u till the end and the music score keeps on echoing in Your ears. And what can i say about acting of Tabu ji. She is the empress when it comes to performance . Kay Kay Manon and Irafan were upto their names as usual. But the person who steals your heart is Shahid . i personally never expected this class from him .Undoubtedly the best role he has ever portrayed and must be thankful to VB for giving him the opportunity of Portraying the troubled mind of Hamlet as Haider. if omkara and maqbool were plausible haider deserves a standing ovation.

            "content": "Vishal Bharadwaj completes his trilogy with William Shakespeare's adaptation of \"Hamlet\", earlier he made\" Maqbool\", an adaptation of Macbeth and \"Omkara\", an adaptation of Othello. \"Hamlet\" was a difficult subject to adapt but Vishal Bharadwaj in association with Basharat Meer has adapted it beautifully. Vishal's \"Hamlet\" or \"Haider\" is set in Kashmir, year 1995, and it tells the story of Haider's (Shahid Kapoor) search for his missing father Dr Hilal Meer (Narendra Jha)who was captured by the army.\"Hamlet\" had many layers to its premise and Vishal has tried to stick to the premise and interwoven those layers with \u00e9lan. Each character right from Haider (Prince Hamlet) to the two Salmans (Courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) who play Haider's childhood friends who spy on Haider to the Gravediggers has been etched well. Vishal has been true to the play and the writing is so strong that you feel the pain and ethos of Haider. Haider's relationship with his mother Gazala (Queen Gertrude) has been portrayed with sensitivity and all the sequences between them are the highlight of the movie. It is Gazala's character which is the best written character in the movie, it is mysterious and unpredictable till the end. It is the second half when the narration slips a bit and slows down the pace; even the climax seems a bit overstretched. It is the 162 mins run time which is a drawback; it could have been 15 mins shorter. Dialogues by Vishal Bharadwaj is witty and at the same time with a lot of depth.Performances by the ensemble cast are the biggest highlight of the movie. Shahid Kapoor as Haider is one of his best performances till date and you can feel the pain and anguish. In some sequences he surpasses all expectations especially the sequence at Lal Chowk, it tapped his versatility as an actor, he proves that only he could have played Prince Hamlet which is the most complex character in English literature. Tabu as Haider's mother Gazala is the best performance of the movie; she is brilliant and does justice to Vishal's writing and vision of Queen Gertrude. Kay Kay Menon as Khurram (Claudius), Haider's uncle proves again that he is an actor to watch out for; he is the most underutilized actor of Bollywood. Narendra Jha as Haider's Father (King Hamlet) Hilal Meer is the surprise element of the movie. He does an excellent job considering the strong actors in the cast, still he shines. Lalit Parimoo another brilliant but underutilized actor plays Parvez Lone (Polonius), the army chief of Kashmir, and his portrayal of this conniving character who loves his daughter is another highlight performance of the movie. His portrayal is underplayed aptly and that is the beauty of his performance. Irfan Khan (The Ghost) as Roohdar the Pakistani militant is a cameo but his portrayal makes it a memorable character of the movie. Shradha Kapoor as Arshi (Ophelia) Haider's love interest is good but her performance gets lost due to some brilliant performances by the rest of the cast. The two Salmans (Courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) Haider's childhood friends played by Sumit Kaul & Rajat Bhagat give you the comic relief but are the weakest characters written in this movie. Kulbhushan Kharbanda in a cameo as Gazala's father-in-law was a delight.Shot entirely in Kashmir and it has been captured beautifully on celluloid by Pankaj Kumar. Dolly Ahluwalia again creates her impact through her costumes which were well researched and developed. Production Design by Subrata Chakraborthy & Amit Ray again was one of the best aspects of Haider. Music another forte of this movie by Vishal Bharadwaj in haunting, especially the Kashmiri folk inspired Bismil and the sensitive Jhelum sung by Vishal himself.Vishal Bharadwaj again proves that he is a sensitive film maker and good with complex subjects. He succeeds in extracting some of the best performances of this year from his cast. The length and the overstretched climax make \"Haider\" a few notches short from being a classic.This is definitely not an entertainer but if you want to watch a good sensitive movie (which is rare) go for it",

            "content": "Vishal Bhardwaj should seriously change his surname to 'Bard'waj, he's undoubtedly an artist par excellence. I always knew his artistry is somewhat distinct, be it his music or his films but I didn't expect it to be my best Bollywood experience. The goosebumps after the film got over stayed with me till I got up today. Haider inspired me as an aspiring filmmaker, not just inspired, but made me question myself: \"If this is filmmaking, do I really have the potential to create something like Haider?\" Hamlet is Shakespeare's longest play with over 4,000 lines and it's one of the toughest ones to adapt, but the way Bhardwaj has done justice to it, it deserves a standing ovation. Recreating the magic and setting it up in Kashmir, who would have thought? Highlighting the inhumanity of the Indian Army on Kashmiris, who would have thought? Equating and chutzpah, who would have thought? You need balls to talk about such issues in a country like India. What a brave chutzpah!Pankaj Kumar's eyes helped us see Kashmir in the minutest form and his cinematography is the backbone of this film. Haider is like a painting, a moving painting. It moves for 162 minutes and creates magic. The musical play in the form of Bismil is one of the highlights. The beautiful lyrics by Gulzar were enough to convey and depict what the film had to.This film would have fallen flat if there was even a single glitch, specially in terms of its performances. But that can't happen if you have a casting director like Mukesh Chhabra. Bhardwaj played with the characters so beautifully that I'm sure Shakespeare would've been proud to watch this rendition. Sumit Kaul and Rajat Bhagat, as Salman 1 and 2 played Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from Hamlet and Bhardwaj placed them so brilliantly that they really managed to leave an impact. Another thing: Salman Khan's presence always works, be it directly or indirectly. Narendra Jha, as Dr. Hilal Meer played Hamlet's father and he is so poetically endearing that it makes your heart cringe, after you get to know about his brother's tricks. Irrfan Khan has a 'REALLY' short appearance, as Roohdar (the ghost identity from Hamlet), but is he good? Or IS HE GOOD? His screen presence, dialog delivery and versatility-when these three things come together, there's magic on screen. Though he had a short part, his character was one of the most important ones. He's his usual best. Aamir Bashir, as Arshia's brother played Laertes and Ashwath Bhatt, as Zahoor (the militant) played Fortinbras:Both were perfect. Lali Parimoo, as Arshia's father and Polonius from Hamlet had a really important bit too. He's an experienced actor who slipped into the character perfectly and is brilliant. Shraddha Kapoor, as Arshia and Ophelia from Hamlet is magical. Finally the actor in her is out. Her beautiful eyes speak more than her. The innocence of her character, the fun and caring Arshia, it all came out well and the scene when she's devastated after her father's demise: Shraddha does magic. Her best till date! Kay Kay Menon, as Khurram and the evil Claudius from the play is class apart. It's a well known fact that Menon is one of the most underrated actors but he never got his due. Haider should put a break on that, as Menon has outdone Claudius by making him his own. The versatility and confidence Menon shows, it's horrific-in a good way. The last shot of Haider would chuckle your bones. Shahid Kapoor, the Hamlet-the Haider is decent. He's decently superlative. He's decently one of the best actors of our generation. He's decently better than the rest. You see Pankaj Kapurin him, you see the passion in him, and you finally see the 'actor.' Hamlet is an actor's dream; it's the toughest character to portray. This one character has so many shades to it and Shahid outdoes himself in each and every frame. From his diction to his body language and his 'bloody-fucking intense' eyes, he literally lives Hamlet and it shows. He's not just a good-looking man who dances like a star, he's an actor-he's an artist. Saved the best for the last-Haider wouldn't have been this without Tabu. She plays Ghazala, Haider's mother-Gertrude from Hamlet. The mother in dilemma! Ghazala has many traits to her, but at the end of the day she's a very caring woman. Tabu takes this to another level. She loves two people who dislike each other and wants to satisfy both, hence the conflict kicks in. Tabu is THE BEST thing about Haider and trust me, she understood each and every nuance of Gertrude and played it with perfection. Although Haider has shades of Oedipus complex, Bhardwaj has smartly toned it down-keeping our audience in mind, but Tabu and Shahid have played that bit so wonderfully that it's unreal.Vishal Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer have written Haider so beautifully that even though there are many changes in Haider and most importantly the end, which is gut wrenching. Revenge creates revenge and revenge is not always the solution, how beautifully has this been portrayed? Haider's love for his mother overpowers the hatred he had for his uncle and that moment defines art. A tear swept down. Goosebumps, yes! And the dark humor has been incorporated brilliantly. From the Salman-Salman to Arshia's English accent to the scene where Roohdar fools a random man who wasn't going inside his house to even the graveyard sequences, where we see a beautiful version of 'Aao-Na.' And the last scene, after the blast-when we see those destroyed human bodies and the cut off hands-RESPECT.And for the people who feel Haider is 'copied' from Hamlet: It's an adaptation of a play, which is a part of literature. So yes, Vishal Bhardwaj is an artist, a gem and Haider is one of the best films I've seen till date. Kudos to UTV, who had the guts to produce this masterpiece.",

            "review_title": "Demystefying Haider: Whose Tragedy is it?",
            "content": "As a subtle philosophical tinge that cinema is a powerful tool for political mobilization and mass persuasion, Slavoj Zizek notes beautifully that, \"It doesn't give you what you desire, it tells you how to desire.\" Haider is the adaptation of Shakespeare's famous Tragedy Hamlet; and the latest Bollywood movie about Kashmir. Question is whose tragedy is Haider? Why many people waited for Haider to release, and see the latest take of Bollywood on Kashmir? There are two reasons why Haider had generated some curiosity among Kashmiri movie lovers: One, it was the adaptation of a play, the story and plot of which was already known to many literature lovers and Shakespeare fanes. Two, its script was co-written by Basharat Peer and directed by Vishal Bhardawaj; Peer known as pioneering English fiction writer amongst Muslims of J&K, and Vishal a successful director for adapting Othello and Macbeth as Omkara and Maqbool respectively. Basharat Peer\u001f\u2013\u2013whose memoir Novel Curfewed Night gave him unprecedented popularity as a writer of the 'ordeal' of Kashmir Conflict. More than Bhardwaj's credentials it was Basharat's involvement in the script writing that many envisaged a change in the routine Bollywood rhetoric. Haider is a typical Bollywood feature film, no different from: Gangster, Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns or Gangs of Wasseypur. It doesn't offer anything on the reality of 'what' is happening inside (or with) Kashmir. Rather, it makes a serious attempt to showcase how a real struggle can be reduced to a family feud under the garb of (mis-informed) adaptation of a Shakespearean classic. In the midst of its mis-informed adaptation it lets the Zizekian tinge (of how to desire) creep in. Film adaption as a derivative work needs to be creative so that the \"thin red lines\" between the original and its adaptation are respected. An adaptation needs to take care of the background, which forms its foundation\u2013\u2013\u2013more so when the background is highly political and sensitive setting like Kashmir. In a new backdrop and setting it needs to take note of minute details such as culture, historicity, contemporariness, traditions, dialect and so on. The question is how far has Haider been successful in adaptation of Hamlet in a highly political backdrop of Kashmir? Is the attempt artistic or political? If it is political, whose politics does its serve? And why do we need to ask these questions at all? Some Kashmiri friends feel highly obliged that Haider has depicted some fractions of conflict. In a Kafila blog, Suhas Munshi writes that \"for faithfully adapting the violence done to Kashmiris,\" Basharat would have to \"script a pornographic narrative for screen.\" The point is not whether Haider succeeds or fails in faithfully portraying the victimhood of Kashmiris from all angles of conflict (structural, political, torture-al etc). This can be a one vantage point to see how far Haider has successfully been able to portray the ordeal of Kashmir that falls within the limits of its frame. And how Basharat ventured to associate the limited frame that forms Haider with its outside\u2013\u2013\u2013the power relation(s) that are so central to the familial relations of Haider's characters and yet so distant (and mysteriously absent) from its frame. For the relations between Haider (Shahid) and his uncle Khurram (K. K. Menon), Arshia (Sharddaa Kapoor) and her father Pervez lone (Lalit Parimoo) are not mere personal relations. They have a deep political nature, which Haider has not endeavored to look into. The invisible hand of sovereign amidst these relations is absent in the frames of Haider. Instead the film attempts to cut a slice from these deeply political relations and present it to the audience in an altogether different avatar\u2013\u2013\u2013an avatar which reduces a struggle for aspirations and a fundamental right (Right to Self-determination) to a revenge saga.

I encourage bollywood to stick to masala entertainers. Even Humshakals was at least funny even if not many people liked it. It was more quality than haider. India is about song, dance and masti. Such boring films like \"Haider\" and this other film, \"Lunchbox\" (booooorrrrriiinnng), are just not welcome here. Overall I give Haider 4 out of 10.

People say non commercial movies are slow that's why they are bad,,,,for me slow movies are not bad if they have the power to make u connect with them ,, but for Haidar without showing any mercy i can say that with the exception of some comic relief rest of the second half was BORING.....In fact i was thing when will the movie end....... The movie haven't done anything to keep on your interest going.....The story is simple ,, Haidar's Father has been kill by the orders of his uncle who also keep bad eyes on his mother....And now Haidar wants revenge.....So Haidar should take revenge,,,,he has the gun , he has the person too,,,,i don't know what was he waiting for.....Why he even taking to his uncle,,,,why didn't he just kill him....Is he afraid of being caught by POLICE ,, i don't think a person having revenge in his mind like Haidar that too in a situation based in 90s of Kashmir would much care about caught by Police.....Rather then killing his uncle Haidar was doing time pass by Showing BISMIL song dancing and spending time in her mothers second marriage and making movie longer and longer and longer...... Listen more,,,,after watching the graveyard of his father Haidar goes to a mentally distracted condition,,,so he says comical things and show awkward expression...That would be OK if that was permanent.....but such mental condition comes and goes ....In one scene he was showing comical faces to his uncle,,,,just in continuation of that scene he just being normal start a romantic scene with his girlfriend and after the song again he goes to the mental disorder condition.....Don't know how VB have done wrong with such silly things.... Infect the Kashmiri accent in the movie was also not permanent....That's really bad... There are a lot of non interesting boring scene that should have been cut down......The movie was really long.... The screenplay was as distracting as the expression of Shahid Kapoor....Movie doesn't go straight forward to its target but it keeps going round and round on the same place for spending more time...... There are some good things too in the movie,,,,like top notch acting , great cinematography (for which it would be a top contender along with Highway), some unexpected comedy,,,,but they cant compensate for the non satisfactory movie.... Yes its better then Saath Khoon MAAF And MATRU,,,,but not good enough....May be i have said too bad for the movie,,,but that's only because i expect a lot from Vishal Sir..... 6.2/10.. by ANuP APu KuMaR....",

It is one of the better works of Vishal Bhardwaj though Maqbool (2003) remain his best and with this film he completed his trilogy of Shakespeare tragedies with a Omkara (2006)in between. With the backdrop of Kashmir insurgency, military invasion & terrorism, this adaptation is not just contemporary but has merged well with the Shakespeare's original Hamlet. Hamlet is known to be most complex work as it also has controversial overtones of Oedipus complex, a much taboo subject till today. Vishal dedicated this film to his father, Late Mr. Ram Bhardwaj, a lesser known film lyricist who never got his due and died a premature death. The problem of Kashmir though extensively but half-heatedly covered in so many films but here with the problem actually forming the backdrop and with few scenes & dialogs, it conveyed much more than all those films put together. The backdrop is violent and scary but rather than depicting excessive violence the focus is more on the impact it creates in the lives of people & thus makes a bold statement. The film is a winner on many fronts- Camera-work, Art Direction, Performances, Costumes etc, thus the craft is in full form. Yes, overall it is dark, depressing, gloomy and not meant for those looking for conventional entertaining cinema. With 2.42 Hrs, it is slightly lengthy. Overall it is a relevant cinema, a good piece of art.",

Vishal Bharadwaj's \"Hamlet\" set in Kashmir milieu has a hardhitting screenplay and a superlative execution by the director known to indianise Shakespeare works for Bollywood. He did it before in Maqbool (2003) and Omkara (2006). This time around, he has knocked it out of the park and completed his hatrick.Haider is highly recommended to the discerning viewer for its terrific performances and well, as its titular character repeatedly says, Chutzpah. Super cinema indeed!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

            "content": "Indian Cinema has not only divulged into the subject of political thriller but also has created a new trend of reality cinema like Madras Cafe and Gangs of Wasseypur. Haider has its own share of story which has been blunt and hard-hitting and yet hair-raising.Based on the play \"Hamlet\" written by Shakespeare, Haider tells story of young and devastated college student who must solve the mystery behind his father's disappearance during an insurgency in Kashmir. Known for his love of Shakespeare, Vishal Bhardwaj takes one step ahead and adapts another tragedy which involves betrayal , confrontation and murder. The pace is slow and the initial reel will bore out of your mind. The film has slight resemblance to Omakara ( again based on Othello) and will take some time to build upon you as it is meant for niche audience but when it does, there is no holding back. Vishal Bahrdwaj is in a great form. After strings of flops , he comes back with a bang. Hats off to him for creating niche drama with well- written screenplay that will keep glued on to the screen till the end. Screenplay is a roller-coaster ride. Editing could be better. Music was a big letdown. Dialogues are nice. Special mention for nice camera shots along with fantastic cinematography capturing the ecstatic terrains of Kashmir. The movie boast of some strong performances coming from powerhouse of talents like Tabu and Kay Kay Menon. Surprise was brilliant show by Shahid Kapoor. The actor shows he can do more than just commercial cinema. Irrffan Khan was good. Shraddha Kapoor was fine.Overall, film begins slowly but draws you into its drama. Good 3 / 5",

            "content": "Like it was with 'Maqbool' (2003), Vishal Bhardwaj's first film based on a Shakespeare play, I had to watch this one more than once to fully understand and appreciate its value. Although I liked this one a lot when I watched it back then, but was unable to fully comprehend the philosophies that this masterpiece conveyed.Today, with much better picture quality, I paid attention to every little detail. This adaption is not just that, it is an interpretation of its own and an even further extension of what must have been a great story by Williams Shakespeare (I am yet to study this play of his, which I am sure to do today or tomorrow). It is the work of an absolute genius (that Vishal Bhardwaj is) to have drawn parallels and similarities between the suffering and the double-mindedness of Haider/Hamlet and that of Kashmir. A bold move (given that the film-maker does not belong to a country not related to the conflict) that could have been very costly, but the application is so masterly that it leaves you awestruck. It is in general one of the boldest films ever in history of the Hindi cinema.For the first 80 percent of the film's length you get the impression that it promotes revenge, but the end takes such a turn that we are told that revenge begets only revenge, it is rotten and a bloody concept that leads you nowhere but to even more confusion and bewilderment. It is very films-like in the first place to imagine a peaceful life after taking your revenge, and to assume that all settles and goes well in life afterwards. I am not in general against the concept of it, but my objection is to the human interpretation and application of it. It is beyond human emotions to know where to draw the line. The hatred for the other leads us, in most cases, into inflicting greater damage than the other might inflicted upon you. Revenge feasts upon hatred, and hatred does not itself cease after revenge.A fantastic performance by each and everyone. Easily Shahid Kapoor's best, who was surrounded by brilliant actors throughout like KK Menon, Irrfan Khan and Tabu, the flawless Tabu. Amidst all this, a special mention goes to its cinematography. The film-makers missed not a chance to point out the earthly paradise that they were shooting in.",

The acting is mostly very good (although there are a few off moments from certain cast members) and the directing is also pretty inventive, it's stylish, yet also grounded and also very energetic.

            "content": "With HAIDER, Vishal does manage to answer his strong opponents with a sheer poetry on the screen in terms of narration, execution and performances. A film based on HAMLET which happens to be one of the most complex plays written by William Shakespeare tweaked with his own master strokes taking the storyline into the breathtaking Kashmir, successfully completing his Shakespeare Trilogy in a time span of a little more than a decade. A gem in cinematic terms for sure which forces you to forget his last two duds instantly. And a film which brings back the beautiful Tabu on the silver screen after a long gap who truly is one of the finest actors of our times without any slightest of doubt.No doubt HAIDER scores much above the director's recent attempts in comparison and breaks several grounds in visualizing a difficult subject on the screen like never before. But along with that another hard and blunt truth remains that the film fails to find that fine balance between meaningful and entertaining cinema as earlier cherished by we all in Vishal's MAQBOOL or OMKARA. And thus is not able to surpass the first two parts of the trilogy in my personal opinion.In other words, yes HAIDER is indeed a brilliant film made by the visionary director for a certain section of viewers, but not as brilliant as MAQBOOL and OMKARA which were unanimously acclaimed by viewers all over quite deservingly. The film has it superb well- conceived highs in its various sequences coming at regular intervals but at the same time has a few major lows too (in its second half) which eventually take the magic away leaving the general public confused and annoyed majorly because of an over-stretched too classy end with some strange theatrical additions.",

            "review_title": "Ambitious, does not live up to the hype",
            "content": "Firstly, I am constantly surprised at the high ratings Bollywood movies seem to garner on IMDb. 8.8 for this, really? That's at par with Schindler's List, Matrix, Forrest Gump and Inception, and this movie is definitely not quite there. I would rate it a 6.5 as an international film, it has some good acting and interesting improvisations, but then its a flawed gem and not quite in a good way.Let's start with the story. It's an ambitious project that seeks to translate the madness and greyness of Hamlet on-screen. Not many directors would be confident enough to take on and experiment with Shakespeare's most- studied and obsessive, self-destructive anti-hero. But Vishal Bharadwaj has been successful with adaptations of Macbeth (Maqbool) and Othello (Omkara) in the past, and, well, Maqbool remains his best work till date. Haider's execution is tame by comparison - a let-down when you consider the explosive pot-boiler of murder, madness, rage, revenge, recklessness, betrayal, blood and incest that the original play offers. The decision to model the decaying state of erstwhile Denmark, and its phase in-between transfer of powers, on Kashmir is double-edged. Kashmir fits, but any storyline with Kashmir will always have to compete with the real-life tragedy of Kashmir - a compelling story of loss and loyalties in itself. Shahid Kapoor as Haider/ Hamlet is simply not good enough to bring focus back from Kashmir and its bleakness. In fact, his performance is easily trumped by Tabu's understated one - and probably not by the director's design. Which does not bode well for a movie with a titular character! Shahid probably gives one of his finer performances till date, but still comes across more as a petulant and confused child out to confound others, than as a young man beset by maddening doubts and suspicions and questioning everything - including himself.The film adds in local twists and tales captured in stark and haunting cinematography - which is a plus point. But then, adding Kashmir to the equation does mean necessarily providing meaningful context to events - which again takes the focus away from the main narrative which ought to have been Hamlet's and Hamlet's alone. The details are sketchy and superficial. The flat political portrayal feels like biased and incomplete propaganda rather than as an atmospheric additive to increase the sense of intrigue essential to the story. AFSPA,'chutzpah' - ah, its even pronounced wrong to make the statement - like the Indian cuss-word, either very clever or very ignorant. To be fair, it is the director's own art and interpretation, even if the film sometimes makes you feel like you are watching two different stories unfurl, bound by a tentative link.The first half is tight and taut, with a promising build-up towards the infamous obsession and reckless violence. However, the second half lets it down thoroughly, with the last half-hour dragging on unnecessarily. There are glimpses of potential, but they don't really deliver. KK Menon and Irfan Khan are quite wasted as actors, and you almost feel annoyed at the director for being such a tease - anyone else could have essayed their respective roles, and without being a bigger talent than Shahid. The doomed love-story (with Shraddha Kapoor), and his brush with the militants till the very end, feel poorly done, with inconsistent plot-flow. Tabu is the best thing in the movie, even in the most incongruous bits, and totally owns every frame she is in. With a storyline as intense as Hamlet's, a backdrop as dramatically evocative as the 90s' militancy-riddled Kashmir, and a great ensemble of actors - well, as a viewer, I would have expected a lot more. Not a bad watch on a big screen, but there are much better films out there. Yes, 6.5 it is and no more.",

The films portray a strong tie to Shakespearean characters, filled with greed, conceits, obsessions etc. Where Maqbool and Omkara were set in the crime world of India, Haider is set in Kashmir during militant insurgency. By far, Haider surpasses both \"Maqbool\" and \"Omkara\" in terms of artistic values. The film is better shot, directed, filled with fabulous performances and outstanding music. The narration and the beautifully photographed Kashmir won't let you get distracted. The performances by Shahid Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, Kay Kay Menon, and Tabbu are to be watched out for.

Vishal has proved his mettle with likes of Maqbool, The Blue Umbrella, Omkara and Kaminey. No doubt, Vishal has a robust hold over what he is doing. Will Haider live up to expectations?

It couldn't have been better. The writers have transformed the idea on paper into a visually splendid movie with superlative script. The dialogues penned by Vishal strike the right chord. Cinematography is of astounding. The DoP depicts Kashmir in an exquisite way. The locations are breathtaking. The music by Vishal is soul touching. Songs like Aao Na and Bismil steal the show. Aao Na is just too melodious. Bismil has all the elements to be a chart buster. Overall, the album is exceptional and distinctive. Tabu comes into form after 'The Namesake' and 'Cheeni Kum'. She gives yet another scintillating performance. The flair that Tabu has is inimitable. No one could have played the role of Ghazala like Tabu. She owns every frame she appears in. Ghazala's role demands to show distress, magnetism and splendor at the same time. Tabu depicts every emotion with poise.

Not only does it shed light on the civilians' plight, the military atrocities and rising tensions in Kashmir during that period, but also explores the lead characters in such unique light, especially, the mother-son relationship; the sexual undercurrent is maintained well, quite nuanced.Haider's character might deviate a bit from the original story, but his development is intriguing and apt for this story. The film not only gives us a strong Hamlet (Haider), but also gives us a memorable Gertrude (Ghazala); she's the more mysterious character, we never know what's going on in her mind. These characters are strong because of the excellent writing and the terrific performances by the two actors, Shahid Kapoor and the ever-so-beautiful-and-sensational Tabu. Kay Kay Menon is excellent as always, and Shraddha Kapoor also gives a commendable performances.The cinematography by Pankaj Kumar is just spectacular; he has captured Kashmir with such elegance. The music composed by the Director himself (as always) is quite mesmerizing; they certainly add to the charm of the film. I liked the rage-filled stage-play song ('Bismil'), and really loved the grave-digging song ('Aao Na') as well. The only annoying thing was the particular score from 'The Bourne Ultimatum' which was used twice in the movie; it was a bit distracting.After the movie is over, everyone would very well remember the word 'chutzpah'; the satirical references of this word with the military's (AFSPA) actions were quite hilarious. The Salman Khan and 90's songs references may not be understood by people who don't follow Hindi cinema.It's mainly a political drama, and has an interesting opinion on revenge, and among all this, it was interesting to see how Bharadwaj created these Shakespearean moments at crucial points in the story.Ultimately, it's not Bharadwaj's best film, but it's certainly one of the best adaptations of 'Hamlet'.",

Tabu embraces her character so well and makes it so mysterious that you are confused whether to sympathize or not with her. Shahid as Haider, Kay Kay Menon as his evil uncle, Irrfan Khan as mysterious helper and Shraddha as Haider's love interest, all give their best. Surprisingly, the movie is laced with dark humour. You won't be able to forget the die hard Salman fans named Salman and Salman and a bunch of aged grave diggers singing \"Aao Na, So Jao Na\"But Haider is a beauty with flaws. Vishal looses its grip in last half an hour and lets movie wander for extra 15-20 minutes before taking it to the grand finale. There are few unexplained sequences like what was the military mission all about?I am going with strong 7 out of 10 for Haider.

The story just doesn't fit into the Kashmir and Indian context. At times it seems that the director is shoving Hamlet into the Kashmir story. Something just doesn't feel right about the whole plot. Pace is extremely extremely slow. I kind of got irritated after the first hour. There are a lot of questions unanswered.. Is VB trying to be the next David Lynch? Why would Ghazala get into extra marital affair with Khurram? She had probably the best husband she could ask for.. at least he seems so. Who is Khurram exactly? Is he a RAW agent? Informer? Why is Haider behaving insanely at times? Is this his way of dealing with her mother's affair? Army is not shown in a good light as well. What is the message VB is trying to convey to the audience? I think VB is kind of unclear about what he wanted to achieve by directing this film. Acting is good though - specially Kay Kay, Tabu, Shahid, Kulbhushan, Arshia's Dad and Irrfan. Nevertheless, I liked the direction - because it is quite different from what you experience in regular Indian masala movies. I just wish that the movie was more contextual and less ambiguous at times. I give it 7/10 based on a good attempt.",

Buy this in Blu Ray and show this to your kids and grand kids. This is definitely a collector's piece. This one goes into my shelf with other epic's like The Godfather trilogy, The Dark Knight trilogy, Scarface etc.I have given this movie a 10 on 10, which it easily deserves. As for the acting, all the characters sizzle with their performances. It's the conflict in their characters which makes the movie gripping. May it be self consuming hatred of Shahid for his mother and uncle, poison minded Tabu, greedy Kay K Menon, innocent Shraddha, purposeful Irrfan AND last but not the last 'THE SNOW' which has its own role throughout the movie, they all SIZZLE ON SCREEN and give a lifetime experience. Vishal the director has proved with this movie that he is perfectly capable of producing world class cinemas. The best thing is the songs do not break the flow of the movie. They are catchy and Aao na is perfectly picturised. Where as Bismil signifies terrific story telling skills of Vishal Bharadwaj.This movie should be appreciated and given a standing ovation.",

            "content": "Vishal Bhardwaj's has nailed it again. He now comes up with 'Haider', the adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. It has all gritty nuances of 'Hamlet', treachery, vendetta, resentment, compassion & clemency. The canvas is set in 1995 Kashmir when it was sweltering & burning, the militants were killing innocents, there was a political turbulence. The backdrop of Kashmir in the era of armed insurgency has never been shown before. 'Haider' goes like painting, painted in a white canvas with crimson shades. Vishal does it with panache; he directs the perfect star cast and gets powerhouse performances. The narrative and screenplay are top notch, it never leaves a loophole. The cinematography captures the real Kashmir and it never adds a wallpaper or extra flamboyancy to already beautiful valley. The footage is quite raw as there is very less color correction used. Vishal has succeeded in bringing out the raw emotions of 'Hamlet' in the film while keeping his focus firmly on Kashmir. The transformation of 'Haider', from a poet to a vengeance-seeking, mentally unstable person is remarkable. Shahid Kapoor delivers a groundbreaking performance; he embodied the character wonderfully and never goes off the mark. Tabu is a real scene stealer with her stellar performance as she goes into the skin of 'Gertrude'. She is a treat to watch as a distressed, unflinching and shattered mother. Kay Kay Menon has always been a great thespian and he does a wonderful job as a shrewd and cunning wannabe politician. The fake emotions and sentiments of a sly soul do look phenomenal. Irfaan, despite his small-screen presence, in a peculiar role, leaves a stamp on our hearts. Rest of the cast has given an impeccable performance'Haider' is great cinematic experience with unsettling, gritty and dark humor placed perfectly. The background score, well-written dialogues, songs, choreography, bold portrayal etc. everything is perfect.However, Kashmir continues to be one of the most controversial political topics in modern India and evokes strong emotions; 'Haider' is not to be missed. Highly Recommended. 8.5/10",

            "content": "Haider is the third offering of Vishal Bharadwaj's trilogy of Shakespearean tragedies which included Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello). For his final instalment, he adapts what is perhaps the most challenging of the three, viz. Hamlet and sets it amidst an equally challenging setting of the restless paradise of earth, Kashmir, circa, 1995. Its brilliance lies in the successful juxtaposition of various strands of portent conflicts across several planes which belie any solution - those within, inter-personal as well as the smouldering geo-political conflicts - to find common grounds therein.Haider (Shahid Kapoor), a student and poet studying in Aligarh has to hurry to his home in the valley when he receives the news of an army crackdown that destroys his home and also results in the disappearance of his father, Dr.Hilal Meer (Narendra Jha), who was taken into custody by the army for harbouring militants. However, on returning home, he is distraught to find little remorse of the disappearance in his mother Ghazala (Tabu) who appears to be settling down quite well with Khurram (Kay Kay Menon), Haider's uncle and his fathers only brother. Haider sets out on a mission to find his father and unravel the mystery surrounding his disappearance. He is assisted in his quest by his childhood sweetheart and local journalist, Arshia (Shraddha Kapoor). The gentle canter of the plot finds momentum at the halfway mark with the arrival of the mysterious and almost ghostly Roohdaar (Irrfan) who contacts Haider. When he discovers the fate of his father, Haider is consumed by rage and obsessed with revenge.The movie sets a gradual pace through the first half to familiarise the viewers with the simmering situation situation in the valley where the daily living is punctuated by overnight curfews, frequent crackdowns, constant fear of living in the shadow of gunfire, a deep-seated dread of being included in the growing lists of those who have disappeared and a security blanket which choked the life out of this paradise. Vishal Bharadwaj and his co-writer Bhasharat Peer cast an unflinching eye on the valley when the insurgency was active to bring us the images which feel very real.Haider gains immensly from its excellent star cast who provide superlative performances in their roles. Shahid Kapoor brings in his best performance till date to capture a very difficult part of Haider (Hamlet) which oscillates across multiple dimensions of love, loneliness, desperation, sorrow, seething rage to seek revenge, subtle hints of Oedipal complex and being on the threshold of lunacy. He has a simmering presence and emotes well in scenes with minimal dialogue even while nailing those where he morphs into an impromptu performer as in the 'Mike Testing....' sequence. Kay Kay Menon aces the role of Khurram (Claudius) who is devious in seeking recognition and power, yet not entirely lacking in warmth. But, Haider's best performance comes from Tabu who plays Ghazala (Gertrude). She plays a complex role which is mired in mystery; a woman whose heart seems tri-sected between the three men in her life - Dr. Hilal Meer, her husband, Khurram, her brother-in-law and Haider, her son. Or, is she just another helpless woman victim in a valley beset with violence, where survival is at a premium and it is only natural that if you survive the bombing of your home, you just jump into the nearest bomb shelter to preserve your self ? There are moments where she appears to drop her guard and lets her vulnerability seep through as in some of her conversations with Haider. Shraddha Kapoor is radiant as Arshia (Ophelia) who is smitten with Haider and tries to assist him in finding his father.Vishal Bharadwaj also adds memorable minor parts, be it Irffan playing the ghostly Roohdaar who sets the plot into motion or Narendra Jha who effectively underplays his part of Dr. Hilal Meer or the duo (Sumit Kaul & Rajat Bhagat) who play Salman and Salman bringing some stray comic relief in an otherwise grim tale or even the elderly grave diggers.Vishal Bharadwaj appears to be an auteur in fine form here as he morphs his world famous source and transplants it to to the troubled landscape of Kashmir to achieve dual goals of narrating a poignant tragedy even as he makes a hard hitting political commentary of a festering wound that continues to consume and singe many a lives without any signs of healing. He and his co-writer Peer capture the insecurities, distrust, anguish and phenomenal sense of loss which permeate the psyche of generations of residents of what was once a paradise on earth as in the scene where Peer himself displays the deep seated scars of a population living in perennial fear. The beautiful, yet desolate images of the snowy landscapes captured by cinematographer Pankaj Kumar combine effectively with the dialogues, haunting background score and Gulzar's lyrics set to Vishal's tunes to present the mutation of this paradise into a morbid hell for its residents. In fact, Tabu's character of Ghazala could as well be seen as a metaphor for the valley itself which is caught between its allegiance between two blood brothers, shrouded in a mysterious veil of apparent self preservation only to let the vulnerabilities show in a few moments when she reaches out to her son affectionately and protectively. While the picture presents a political commentary that need not be entirely neutral, the essence of the commentary tends to abhor violence for any reason.This is a tour de force in film making as Vishal Bharadwaj marshals his entire arsenal - a fine adaptation, stellar star cast acing well fleshed out characters, superb writing, bewitching cinematography, soulful score and music and much more - to make the boldest political movie of our times to stress that revenge merely begets revenge and can never be a path to seek freedom.Yes, the movie does have its fair share of flaws - a languid pace, for one - just as its characters do.. Yet, just as its characters shine through their flaws, the movie too soars to hitherto uncharted trails.Intense, grim, dense and somber, Haider may not be a movie that would suit everyone's palette, especially those who are faint of heart and yet, if, \"To watch, or, Not to Watch\" is your question, \"Steel yourself and don't miss this MUST WATCH which would haunt you long after you've watched it\" is my most definitive answer.",

In past vishal Bhardwaj tried his hand on 'Macbeth' and 'Othello'. Both were critically acclaimed but failed to deliver success on box office. Some how 'Omkara'- an adaptation of 'Othello' leaves an image of average success due to finest act of Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan.No doubt Sahid Kapoor has given his best performance and finest act of his career as Haider, No doubt he is going to be nominated for best actor for these year, but Movie fails to deliver the impact on audience, due to length and boringness.Haider's leaves impact in some parts but not entire movie. The best scene of movie is When Haider gives speech on street, these was one of the finest scene of movie, marvelous act by Sahid. Haider has a chance to be a masterpiece, but it fails. Nice Background Score, Music is strictly OK. If we talk about Performance, All have given there best. Shraddha Kapoor looks gorgeous and acted well as Arshia, Kay Kay Menon is excellent. Tabu is superb.Overall, Haider is an Average Movie. If we see Haider in performance division, Its a masterpiece, but if we see in all verticals, its really disappointing.

Its trump cards are its stunning cinematography and ground breaking performances by Shahid Kapoor and Tabu. This Bollywood adaptation of Hamlet is a marvelous piece of art which sadly only a handful people will appreciate in India. Director-Writer Vishal Bhardhwaj has to his name acclaimed films like 'Maqbool' and 'Omkara' both adaptations of Shakespearean work. Unfortunately I have not seen them but I have seen 'Kaminey' where I got a chance to witness his talent. His films mostly have grim themes giving us the glimpse of darker side of humans.Many of us are familiar with the plot of 'Hamlet'. A son returns home to find out about his missing father. On this path he finds harsh truths which puts on a quest for revenge and vengeance. 'Haider' is the name of the son here in place of 'Hamlet'. All of this set in the disputed lands of Kashmir, where frequent conflicts have made lives miserable for the Kashmiris. I advice to get to know about the Kashmir Conflict for those who are unaware, will be really helpful in connecting more with the characters and their lives. Vishal Bhardwaj makes excellent use of this setting to give a powerful story.Shahid Kapoor gives one of his finest performances as Haider. I could deeply feel Haider's desperation, confusion and urge for freedom. His monologue in front of the crowd of locals was memorable. Another great performance is given by Tabu as Haider's mother portraying eloquently her motherly love. Kay Kay Menon as Haider's uncle and Shraddha Kapoor as Haider's love interest do a good job. Irrfan Khan was a delight as always even with a smaller role. There are many songs, none of the seemed out of place or unnecessary like most Bollywood films. They blend into the atmosphere smoothly, making the movie kind of musical as well. Vishal Bhardwaj's script was immensely poetic and thought-provoking. The expansion over the Hebrew word 'Chutzpah' was really intriguing and eye-opening.It has many thematic elements about the imminent fate of life and philosophy behind freedom and revenge. The pacing is quite slow,so be patient.But I felt it was necessary to connect with characters and the environment more deeply. The ending was visceral and powerful, made me feel worth the wait. The only thing I found bit let down is that it attempts unconditional humor.Also sometimes the film tries involves the regional conflicts a bit too much which is not core of the film. Still overall the films like a masterpiece in recent few years in Bollywood.At the end you need to have the right mindset before watching Haider. Its a very dark and depressing story so don't go into expecting to be entertained in a fun a way. If such movies are not your taste, please don't watch it and unnecessarily rant. There are still quality film makers in Bollywood like Vishal Bhardwaj which makes me immensely proud. Respect him for making a piece of art like 'Haider'.RATING: [4/5]",

The play is integrated into the conflict. In Hamlet in the end everyone dies and so in the Kashmir conflict everyone loses as the situation has reached a stalemate. The film if taken on it's own merits is a bit slow paced and the acting by KK Menon and Shahid Kapoor is not always convincing. But when the play is added to the equation it makes more sense.

            "content": "Vishal Bharadwaj is a Bollywood maverick.Its no longer a novelty for the film-maker to interpret the Shakespearen tragedies onto celluloid,but the precision and his propensity for cinematic depth has always been commendable.If Maqbool was Macbeth revisited and had its roots in the Mumbai underworld,Omkara,his adaptation on Othello, dwelled in the badlands of UP.With what I would call a consummation of trilogy, Haider is the director's representation of the tragic Hamlet which unravels in the troubled and violent landscape of the terrorism-infested Kashmir.A poet in the making,Haider(Shahid Kapoor)returns to his homeland in Kashmir only to learn that his father was arrested on allegations of being a militant and has gone missing from the army camps.The desperate boy goes on a quest to find his father with a vigorous streak of rage and hatred that he has against his mother,Ghazala(Tabu),whom he suspects of having an affair with his conniving uncle,Khurram(Kay Kay Menon).While he finds some solace in the arm of his girlfriend,Arshee(Shraddha), he swears to avenge the death of his father when he learns from a mysterious Roohdaar(Irfaan Khan) that Khurram plotted his murder for vested interests.Vishal's approach is quite paradoxical.The most tumultuous relationships in Haider are explored against the calm and languid sceneries of Kashmir.The paradise is viewed with a conflicting perspective.The snow is thick and the air smells of deceit,it genuinely forms a mystic backdrop for the underlying tension and the undercurrent of revenge that runs through the film.And he gives great emphasis to each nuance.Be it the oedipal undertones in the mother-son dynamics or the sensitive insurgency issue gripping the militancy-led Kashmir.The DOP is top-notch, each shot is a testimony of great detailing and each sequence is a visual delight.The narrative echoes 'chutzpah' with sprinkles of dark humor in the form of two bumbling informants idolizing Salman Khan and his antics !However,the director's over-indulgence ruptures the second half with a snail-paced progress and too much of theatrical treatment.The film gets a massive filip from the strongest performances of the pivotal casts.Lending poignancy to his character,Shahid Kapoor embodies Haider with a festering rage.His expressions are palpable and its a giant leap for the actor to transform himself into a anguish-led man.Shraddha Kapoor adorns Arshee with vulnerability, while Kay Kay excels as the mean face, a scorpion the deception- ridden plot.Tabu emerges as the film's trump card,embracing the guilty Ghazala with amazing precision and sincerity.As the 'half- widow, half-married' woman torn between the love for his son and familial duty, she imbues her character with an unsettling resolve.Haider is Bharadwaj's most accomplished piece of work.Its a case of artistic extravaganza coupled with aesthetic pleasure - a treat for your eyes,a thought that stirs your psyche.I came out of the theater shell-shocked and strongly recommend you make your time for it.Rating : 4/5",

Though acting wise all except Kapoors (Shraddha and Shahid) have done phenomenal job there. Mixing of Hemlet with Kashmir issue was also to some extent OK but by the end I think the director have not been able to do justice with both of them and the film falls apart. Songs were unnecessary and many scenes were there just to show \"art\".Cinematography is also average. There was no suspense and all character were linear from the beginning. I don't know why people are saying that characters were complex and the end of the movie will haunt you. The only thing haunting me is that I have wasted money and lots of time in this movie. So thank you guys (who wrote reviews) for ruining my day ;-) For all those who have not seen this movie, go on your own risk to the theater.

The Kashmir setting makes it even more interesting and I should say the film script does a great job in dealing with this complicated backdrop to the story. Moreover, the dialogues are well written too and some of them would become memorable ones. Among the performances, Shahid Kapur comes into his own in this movie and it is probably his best one so far. The best shot is where he is performing before a crowd in the second half. The script really takes off to a different plane here. The energy Shahid exudes in the second half is par excellence. Tabu looks a little washed out but that may be because of the character. Overall the movie really grips you and takes you through the troubled land of Kashmir and its people. Fundamentalists may find the treatment of the Kashmir issue unpalatable, but the film cleverly skims the surface as it remains focused on the main plot.

            "content": "From it's first frame itself and the first note of background music Haider transports you to Kashmir and the duality of its inherent stunning beauty and its also inherent conflict and suppression of freedom. You begin to feel trapped and claustrophobic thanks to what the characters feel. Asides from Haider's dilemma, one also begins to feel strongly for Gazala's (Tabu) subplot. And the women of the film pretty much represent Kashmir in their very being, they're strong characters but are being beaten from every angle and no matter what they're doomed to lose and fail. Gazala's sexuality and yet her need to prove to her son that she loves him, and yet somehow stay alive in this towering inferno of a state, is painfully beautiful. Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor) is also another representation of Kashmir; Fiery, feisty, yet soft and so nurturing and again, beaten from every side and at every step by an overpowering reality. The main plot of Haider interestingly remains about revenge but once Haider knows who the killer is, it takes too long for him to do something about it. This probably is its only weakness.Other than that, even the smallest of moments, taken from the book 'Curfewed Night' by Basharat Peer, who's also the screenwriter of the film, are poignant. A short scene of a mother waiting in the police waiting area with a picture of her lost son and Haider shows her the picture of his lost father, thus speaking of how everyone is in the same emotional space, a scene of a boy amidst a sea of dead bodies who realizes he has no bullets on him and begins to celebrate being alive, the way a militant identifies people through a car by sounding a horn, crackdowns at the break of dawn by the army and a general overarching suffocation at the hands of the Indian govt and so also the army has come across beautifully. The music is beautiful the cinematography truly captures the mood of the times and the place and the performances are all brilliant with Tabu taking the cake. Also probably SHahid's best yet, right from a comic tragic speech at the town square to the end of the film. KK Menon is also fabulous and so is his last minute turn around for Tabu.",

            "review_title": "Chutzpah - The audacity to promise excellence and delivering disappointment",
            "content": "When one tries to better excellence in their work, they often fail, take for example Christopher Nolan, who delivered quality in Batman Begins, excellence in The Dark Knight, and falters miserably in The Dark Knight Rises. Vishal Bhardwaj is one such movie maker from India who we are collectively proud of, in terms of the quality of cinema that he produces. His movies can easily be compared to a dark night of winters with background music provided by thunderstorm. Usually, either his characters are dark in their thoughts or the story is too dark or both, and it is carried beautifully forward by poetic dialogs and intricate relationships of those dark characters. Maqbool was pure brilliance, and adaptation of Othello in Omkara was excellence, but Haider (adapted from Hamlet) falters miserably showing signs of brilliance intermittently as if trying to justify the existence of the whole movie in those few moments. Where Haider fails is that it tries to deliver a message, a bit too strongly i would say, which was not the case with Maqbool or Omkara. When you try to make a movie close to reality, you often fail in fictionalizing its story and cease to take liberty in delivering a cohesive story. The message for me takes to much of time in the movie so that Mr. Bhardwaj was not able to fully form his characters. For example: Haider, (BTW Shahid acted brilliantly): Director was not convincing in terms of forming the reasons as to how much Haider truly loved his father and mother (in a sexual way, which is the pretext of Hamlet), or how could he eventually end up being mad which further befalls his characteristic of indecision to kill his uncle. In the original play, Confusion was the central theme of the protagonist, however, Haider was not able to establish strongly why he was confused, or whether he was really so confused about things. Compare it to Langda Tyagi in Omkara, he had all the reasons to hate Omkara, which were very well established and brilliantly portrayed by Saif Ali Khan (easily his life's best act). Langda Tyagi was as convincing as anything you can imagine but not Haider.Ghazala Meer (again Tabu here was pretty awesome): The focus could have been easily distributed amongst these 2 characters of Mother and Son, as Director did with Langda Tyagi and Omkara, however, by adding such strong actors as Irrfan Khan and KK, you are bound to look at them, appreciate them, and eventually lose focus from the central characters.Best Scenes comparison with Omkara:The recitation of Armed Forces Special Act by Haider: This was a brilliant scene, well acted and well edited, and frankly there is no scene like this in Omkara. Hats off.The Skull scene at Graveyard by Haider vs The mirror breaking scene of Langda Tyagi: The graveyard scene could have been the pivotal scene of the movie Haider, however, the unnecessary humor kills it as opposed to a few strong dialogs and the show-of-strength of the color red in the mirror scene in Omkara.As said earlier and throughout, it was supposed to exceed Omkara in brilliance, form a strong story around even stronger characters, but it was not able to convince me for any of its strong performances. It was a disappointment.Chutzpah was repeated several times in the movie, and eventually I felt like it, where the promise was the audacity and the deliverance led to disappointment.",

It is neither anti- India nor pro-Pakistan, it shows the real pain and agony which has been inflicted on Kashmiris by both India & Pakistan. And many people are arguing why has not the plight of KPs been shown in this movie. To all those dimwits the movie begins in the year 1995 and not 1991. KPs left Kashmir in 1991 and secondly it was all a political conspiracy to crush the rebellion back here. After KPs left Indian army was given a free hand to kill Kashmirs with impunity as result hundreds of massacres took place. There are hundreds of Jallianwala Bagh in Kashmir; Gawkadal, Bijbehera, Sopore, Handwara, Chattisinghpura, Wandhama to name a few. The only purpose of carrying these massacres was to instill fear in the mind of people and crush the armed rebellion but unfortunately for India that didn't happen as a result KPs were left in exile. I know almost every Indian is aware of the fact that Indian government was solely responsible for the exodus of KPs but no one is ready to embrace this fact. Let the sanity prevail. Peace out.",

            "review_title": "\"Haider\" is riveting...",
            "content": "Vishal Bhardwaj is the lone present-day Indian filmmaker with the imagination and gumption to tackle transposing Shakespeare works against a contemporary Indian setting. In 2003, financing \"Maqbool\"\u2014his iteration of the Scottish play\u2014proved tough, but the film's box-office and critical success enabled more adaptations. \"Omkara\" (Othello) followed in 2006, and now comes his best Shakespearean effort to date: \"Haider\", a dark, daring, layered take on \"Hamlet\". His master stroke was placing \"Haider\" in 1990s Kashmir, when communal and geopolitical tensions\u2014festering from the time of India's independence from British rule\u2014explode with devastating consequences. The land itself, referred to in antiquity as \"Jannat\" (Heaven), has been riven by decades of strife, fought over by India and Pakistan. (Hundreds of thousands of Hindu Kashmiri Pandits fled their homeland to live as refugees elsewhere in India \u2013 do not look to \"Haider\" for their story. For that, one should watch filmmaker Onir's omnibus film, \"I Am\" (2010) where one narrative strand \"I am Megha\" looks at post-Partition Hindu-Muslim relations through the eyes of Megha, a displaced Kashmiri Pandit.) \"Haider\" is set amid the Muslim majority that populates Indian-administered Kashmir. A segment of these Muslim Kashmiris have allegedly been radicalized, trained, financed, and armed by Pakistan to destabilize the region. The decades-long armed conflict between these insurgents and the Indian military forces deployed to maintain Indian sovereignty has effectively turned Kashmir into hell on earth. The lives of the ordinary citizenry\u2014who only ask to be left in peace\u2014are filled with turmoil, their personal freedoms drastically curtailed by curfews,check-points, random raids and imprisonment seemingly without just cause. By staging the action of \"Haider\" in this context, Bhardwaj politicizes the Shakespearean text brilliantly (albeit with a few startling, strategic changes) to make a plea for the end of the cycle of revenge and retribution. True freedom, he and his co-writer the Kashmiri journalist Basharat Peer say, can be achieved only when one renounces the quest for vengeance. The beauty and genius of Shakespeare's timeless works is that they can be superimposed over any geography, any period, any genre of cinema, and still resonate with undiminished immediacy and universal truth. Dr. Hilal Meer (Narendra Jha) is a politically neutral, dedicated physician whose altruistic deeds in desperate times fill his more savvy wife Ghazala (the glorious Tabu) with apprehension. When he brings home an insurgent leader for an emergency appendectomy (I'm simply doing my job), the frantic Ghazala berates him for the foolhardiness of his actions. \"Whose side are you on?\", she demands; his response: \"I side with Life.\" Almost immediately the military shows up, arrests Dr. Meer for treason, and blows up his home. Ghazala moves in with his brother Khurram (KK Menon), a lawyer with political ambitions, and appears to carry on with her life. Haider, her son (Shahid Kapoor), returns from university in Aligarh in search of his \"disappeared\" father, and is incensed to find his mother apparently delighting in the amorous attentions of his uncle, who still addresses her as Bhabhi Jaan (beloved sister-in-law).Bhardwaj and Peer cleverly conflate the characters of Horatio and Ophelia, thus giving Arshia (played surprisingly well by relative newcomer Shraddha Kapoor) more to do \u2013 as a journalist, she is Haider's helper, confidante, and lover. Her father Pervez (Polonius) is part of the Indian security forces, and keeps a close watch on Haider. Haider scours Kashmir's prison camps and detention centers in vain for his father. In these modern times when paranormal phenomena would be scoffed at, Bhardwaj comes up with another smart device. He introduces the ghostly apparition\u2014the spiller of the beans in Shakespeare's play\u2014without challenging audience credulity. Roohdar (literally Spirit-filled One), a mysterious visitor with possibly questionable motives (Irrfan Khan doing a dandy job), confirms Haider's father was put to death, his treacherous uncle Khurram was the police informant, and his father's dying wish is for Haider t0 avenge him by killing Khurram. Haider returns home with photographic evidence of his dead father. Funeral rites are performed alongside preparations for the wedding of Khurram and Ghazala. Wishing to discover the truth for himself, Haider enacts the betrayal of his father in the form of a song and dance for the entertainment of the wedding guests. Khurram calls an abrupt end to the performance, sealing his guilt Haider's eyes. Now it is open war between the two. Khurram dispatches a pair of buffoon-like, yet treacherous Salman Khan fans (former schoolmates of Haider, they run a video rental shop stocked mainly with Salman Khan blockbusters)to kill Haider. Haider outwits this story's perfidious Rosencrantz & Guildenstern and finishes them off. Will Haider live long enough to avenge his father's death? Whom should he believe: Roohdar,Khurram, or Ghazala? How does his romance with Arshia play out? For answers, I highly recommend watching \"Haider\". Apart from the writing which is, unquestionably, the star, \"Haider\" boasts outstanding performances by the entire cast. Shahid Kapoor sets aside his lover-boy image and is practically unrecognizable as Haider. His initial diffidence vanishes as his character gets more and more embroiled in the machinations of his loved ones. This performance marks his entry into the ranks of grown-up thespians. KK Menon, Irrfan Khan, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, the men playing Polonius, Laertes, and the Salman Khan clones \u2013 they are all excellent. Motivating the actions of all the men;goading them, yet wishing desperately to prevent their doom is the great Tabu. Her Ghazala Meer is a Gertrude for the ages \u2013 her entreaty to Haider to break the cycle of revenge echoes long after the film ends. Maternal love was never so fierce \u2013 what recourse does the hapless Haider have but to heed her. Despite a few jarring tonal shifts (the Haider-Arshia love song and the gravediggers' jolly ditty), and the mispronunciation of \"chutzpah\" in a soliloquy, \"Haider\" is the most profound and provocative Hindi film thus far of 2014.",

            "content": "Vishal Bharadwaj's adaptation of Shakespeare's titular play 'Hamlet' is dark, gritty and thoroughly meticulous in craft. There is always a beauty about snow white backdrop that provides the canvas to draw human fallacies in red. 'Haider', set in the backdrop of Kashmir proves to be violently beautiful. But it's not the violence, or the prominent vengeance of 'Hamlet'; nor the socio-political dogma that creating a ripple of controversy was faced by the people during the 95 Kashmir Conflicts, that was the driving force of Haider. It was the awry and eerie love and relationship between the mother-son duo of Ghazala and Haider.The primary characters of the story, and their relationship did not deviate much from Hamlet in the film. But, just like his previous films on Shakespeare's works, Bharadwaj triumphs, more prominently in this film, in the craft of blending the tragedy of the play with the emotional aspect of the story. Thus, the film becomes very unique and Bharadwaj's own in that perspective. The preparation and hard work of the director reflects in the film's narrative.Much like Hamlet, Haider arrives in a discontent Kashmir to find that his family has been torn apart by the war that is brewing between the Militants and government. Amidst that, people are disappearing, seemingly at random. To Haider's grief, he finds that his father is one of the missing persons and to his shock he finds out the proximity of the relationship between his mother and uncle, Khurram.Viewers could almost sense the amount of threads Bharadwaj was spinning in the film. Whether it was Haider's search for the truth, the controversial torment of the common people in Kashmir, or Haider's search for his father that continues to reek of betrayal and thus spawn vengeance in his heart; Haider's love for his fianc\u00e9e or the palpable love between Haider and Ghajala, which to me is crowning glory of this tale of vengeance \u2013 all of these threads creates the web where our titular protagonist is at the heart of. And herein lies the mastery of Vishal Bharadwaj that not for once one could feel him losing the grasp in the story, such is the screenplay.A film like this deserves the acting brilliance it had in the cast. First of all, Shahid Kapoor, hitherto mostly playing romantic characters (with the slight exception of Kaminey, another Vishal Bharadwaj film), was nothing less than magnifique in his portrayal of the central character. The soliloquy of his in the midst of the street would and should go down as one of the finest acting display in Bollywood. Kay Kay Menon, as the antagonist Khurram, does his work deftly. But, perhaps, being an ardent Kay Kay fan, it just seemed a tad bit overtly dramatic from his part in some occasions. In smaller roles, Irrfan Khan (as the enigmatic Roohdar) and Narendra Jha (as Haider's father Hilal) do more than than their limited screen time allowed. Shraddha Kapoor does not disappoint either.But, the film was provided another dimension by the performance of one woman. Perhaps it was symbolic that the story had powerful men falling into destruction through the love of one woman, the femme fatale in its truest sense. A character like Ghajala needed acting of highest order, and Tabu, just like the woman she portrayed, put her male acting colleagues a league behind her in this film.The film is backed up adeptly by Vishal Bharadwaj's own compositions -Songs 'Aaj ke Naam' and 'Jhelum' provides a bleak yet soulful tune, and not every day one can see the visual portrayal of songs like 'Bismil' and 'So Jao'. Superlative cinematography of Pankaj Kumar does not go amiss either.Haider is a mammoth sized achievement in contemporary Hindi cinema, basking in the glory of its display; and it needs to be watched.5/5",

            "content": "Vishal Bharadwaj has an excellent reputation in the Hindi film industry, but his films clearly aren't for everyone. You could never sit with the entire family and watch Omkara, Saat Khoon Maaf, Kaminey or Haider but he does what he does pretty well. Haider is no doubt one of his better films, but it's a story that loses you way too many times. Not that I glance away from the screen that much, but some of the dialogues aren't clear enough for the average movie watcher to understand. Shahid Kapoor delivers his best work to date. He eases into the role of Haider and shows what he is really made of. It seems that only Bharadwaj can bring out the best in him because his other films clearly don't bring out anything in him! His on screen presence with Tabu is excellent and one of the best mother-son combinations in recent times. Tabu is back with a bang and it's great to see her in a different avatar to what we've seen in the past. She is a powerhouse of acting talent, and Haider allows her to portray this. KK Menon is also back with a bang, and does an excellent job in the negative role. Shraddha Kapoor looks beautiful, and delivers another good role to her already growing portfolio of good work. Irrfan Khan is just too good and I wish he had a more meatier role. The music of the film is really good - Khul Khabi and Aao Na are my favourites. Not sure what Vishal is doing with the song Jhelum though?! On the whole Haider is a good film, but certainly not one that I would put forward to win any best film awards. It does deserve two awards - Best actor for Shahid and Best supporting actress for Tabu.",

            "review_title": "Best film of the year 2014",
            "content": "When films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select dialogues, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered \"foreign films\". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and dialogues and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The picturization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider\u2014 a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart-rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare\u2014and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal",

Vishal Bhardwaj has taken the source material, re-shaped it to meet the Indian context, and has made the story his own, while at the same time remaining faithful to the original. The story starts with Haider (Shahid Kapoor) returning to his home in insurgency-ridden Kashmir, after his father Hilaal Meer has been taken away by the army for treating an injured militant. Hilaal is a doctor, an idealist who believes in \"being on the side of life, not of ideology\". By the time Haider returns to his homeland, his father has joined the ranks of the \"disappeared\" and the home of his childhood has been destroyed. Worst of all, Haider's mother Ghazala (played by a luminous Tabu) seems to be drowning her sorrow in the arms of her brother-in-law Khurram (Kay Kay Menon). Haider joins the ranks of those Kashmiris desperately searching for their loved ones who have disappeared - seeking his father in hospitals and morgues, turning over blood-drenched bodies in a truck, a sheaf of photocopied photos of his father in his backpack. His childhood sweetheart (Shraddha Kapoor) tries her best to be supportive, but is unable to break through his wall of depression. His depression spirals into rage when he is contacted by a mysterious Roohdaar (Irrfan Khan) who confirms that his father has been killed because of the machinations of Khurram and Ghazala, and that his father's wish was for Haider to avenge his death. From then on, the movie descends into the depths of Haider's thirst for vengeance. The choices he makes, and the consequences of those choices drive the rest of the movie to its inevitable conclusion.Shahid Kapoor plays Haider in the role of a lifetime. His talent, generally obscured by his pretty-boy looks, is in full force here. His eyes mirror his vulnerability and despair, his rage and brutality and eventually his madness. The movie belongs to him. Tabu is Ghazala, glorious as ever. Described as half- widow, half- bride, she does a wonderful job of conveying forbidden obsession and desperation. Her relationship with her son, with their unexplainable passion for each other, is delicately portrayed. Kay Kay Menon is, as always, wonderful as the clownish and somewhat pathetic Khurram, gradually revealing his true face. Irrfan Khan is impressive in his small role as Roohdaar. Vishal Bhardwaj has succeeded in capturing the desolate beauty of Kashmir, once described as \"heaven on earth\". The snow takes on a character of its own, and as Haider spirals into madness and destruction, the snow-filled roads and woods seem more threatening than beautiful. The movie effectively captures the struggle of an entire people, trapped by misplaced patriotism and opposing ideologies. Not an action movie, watch it to see poetry translated to",

The movie revolved around the missing of a Kashmiri surgeon accused of being a Militant, a son came back to know the reality of his father's dissapperance which lead to discovery of Some unexpected events and what happened henceforth is HAIDER all about......Good Points: Sensitive Kashmir topic, the faces of those wretched Kashmiri people irrespective of religion, people getting Disappeared on false accusations will left you spell bound and surprisingly sad.....SHAHID SHAHID AND SHAHID...iots his show.....never expected Haider out of Shahid...but this actor nailed it and gave such a niche performance , that viewers will remember it for a long time....His acting was crafty and full of Classy endings......Shraddha had nothing much to do... Kay Kay Menon as usual delivered an expected performance, Tabu relived her Chandani Bar and Maqbool ages, she is phenomenal, Irfan is perhaps the best Dialouge deliverer of this age... Cinematography perfect, Background Scoring apt and strong, Emotions perfectly portrayed, Direction Applausable..Bulbul is such a good numberBad Points: a particular scene/song in a graveyard was out of my understanding level....Rest a Dreamy touchy tale...of Loss and Suffering....MUST WATCH....",

            "content": "What happens when the outlines of Hamlet, is adapted to a clich\u00e9d story of revenge, given a poetic touch to the narration, with the setup based in Kashmir, and decorated with the finesse of actors such as Shahid Kapoor, KayKay Menon, Tabu, ? - It becomes a masterpiece called \"Haider\".The story is the same revenge saga, with a guy searching for his father being accused as a militant and taken away by the Indian military, presumably to be dead. And the quest of Haider to take a revenge from his father's killer.So far nothing great. But its the narrative, detailing, intensity, acting of the actors, background score, and dark humor which stands out.Right from the first frame itself, it gives you a feeling that its going to be a spectacular treat at least. As the movie progresses, you are engrossed into the story, so much so, that you don't realize that it's interval. Till here you have already seen the soul of the movie - the real Kashmir and the real life situations of Kashmiris which is a part and parcel of their daily lives. So much so that a person stands outside his house and only enters when someone asks him to show his identity. Its both humorous as well as thought provoking, only showing how much they are habituated of these things. After all this, you start thinking that now the movie will get boring from here.But it ends up being the opposite, with the movie only progressing towards being even better. If first half is about Tabu, Kaykay Menon, and Irfan Khan; second half is only and only about Shahid Kapoor and his acting finesse. Definitely Vishal Bhardwaj knows how to extract full potential from Shahid. It's his best performance till date - he has easily evolved from being a innocent Kashmiri, to a menacing militant. The beauty of his role is that unlike typical movies he is menacing, yet hasn't shed blood until the last 15 minutes of the movie.Shradha has nothing more to do except few intense scenes with her father and brother. Special mention must be for an unknown actor \"Rajat Bhagat\" who has copied Salman Khan at its best - his style of picking the phone, his style of flipping his hair, every little detail of his. Every time he comes on screen, the audience is all cheers. Even for the three actors who dig graves and sing \"Are aao na, so bhi jao na\" - such a humorous yet poetic scene.But beyond all this, the soul of Haider lies in showing us the real face of Kashmir. It compels one to think twice who is gaining in between all these endless fights, protests, revenge. The movie does not want to favor either the militants or the Indian army. All it conveys is that \"seeking revenge in return will only make things worse and cyclic, and it must stop from either side\".Even the climax is symbolic where Shahid leaves his father's killer alive with his legs amputated. It only reflects that rather than taking life, sparing someone with a permanent scar is the worst revenge one can take. Bloodshed is not the only solution.VB has certainly taken Indian cinema to a new height.",

            "content": "Vishal Bhardhwaj's magnum opus.\nLike Omkara's dark horses,Saif Ali Khan & Deepak Dobriyal : Haider has its very own dark horse - Kay Kay Menon & his gripping rendition of Khurram Meer / King Claudius.Bhardwaj has interestingly adapted Hamlet to the rise of Pakistani-sponsored-terrorism in the formerly peaceful South-Western parts of Jammu & Kashmir in the '90's - the most interesting being , Irrfan Khan's cameo, Roohdar,as the Ghost of Hamlet's father.Roohdar carries the message of retribution to Haider against Khurram Meer & just like the Old King's ghost asked Hamlet to spare Queen Gertrude for heavenly justice, so does Dr.Hilal Meer request the same for Ghazala Meer.Bhardwaj hasn't shied away from Prince Hamlet's/ Haider's Oedipal complex & the undercurrent between him & Ghazala - a beguiling portrayal by Tabu with echoes of ambiguity like Desdemona/Dolly (that confused Othello/Omkara)Gazala is tantalizingly ambiguous,leaving Haider confused about her guilt till the very end - ambiguous about her adultery, her true intent in Hilal's arrest & her manipulation of Haider with threats of suicide.Arshi,like Ophelia is trapped in her loyalty to both Haider & her father Polonius / Pervez Lone.Arshi demonstrates a 'charming' example of asinine subcontinental racism in her opening scene,where a North Indian moronically,refers to a South Indian as 'Masala Dosa'.Bhardwaj has inserted a little red scarf into the film, that poetically traces its path from Arshi to Pervez to Haider & back to Pervez & finally to a grieving Arshi - the scarf being unravelled by the same hands that knitted them.\n \nHaider burns in the same confusion as Hamlet did. While Hamlet doubted his father's ghost as a deceptive demon: Haider fears choosing between Roohdar's & Khurram's contradictory versions of Hilal's death.Haider's dilemma is resolved when he finally overhears Khurram's confession while at prayer,displaying the remarkable self-awareness that Claudius possessed while he prayed, \"O, my offence is rank,it smells to heaven\"\nKapoor trembling with a gun,behind an oblivious Kay Kay Menon is one of the several electrifying scenes in the film.Other adaptations from Hamlet are Liyaqat being used by Khurram to kill Haider as Laertes was by Claudius , Haider holding Arshi in her grave as Hamlet did with Ophelia , Haider's wedding dance like Hamlet's play to test Claudius' guilt.In contrast to Hilal's request for revenge,Haider's paternal grandfather's ( Kulbhushan Kharbanda ) voice resonates till the end when Gazala reinforces his wisdom,that revenge starts a vicious cycle & no true freedom is to be attained through it,when he pointed out the ridiculousness of people demanding for freedom when they were already free.After collapse of the USSR in '91, the militants who warred against the Soviets for a decade were unemployed - this dangerous, unsavoury population was put to work by the likes of Zia-ul- Haq ( after humiliating defeats in 3 wars with India-'48,'65,'72 ) who transferred this blood-thirsty crowd from the Western Af-Pak borders to the Eastern Indian borders & started infiltration,brainwashing & bloodshed in the peaceful state in the '90s.Haider is a victim of this brainwashing & shows delinquent tendencies as a schoolboy when he's caught carrying a gun in his schoolbag & defies both parents when they try to send him to Aligarh to save his future from ruin.Later Haider shows no qualms in murdering a guard,bludgeoning two acquaintances ( the Salmans- Rosencrantz & Guildenstern ) to death & killing Arshi's father.Ghazala risks her life to save schoolboy Haider's future & education,while Haider suspects her tactics as manipulation. She obligingly puts an end to her ambiguity when she ultimately sacrifices her life for Haider ( like Gertrude drinks the poison, Claudius arranged for Hamlet )In the blood-curdling finale, Khurram demonstrates that ,though guilty of fratricide - his love for Ghazala was true. While everyone fled from Ghazala, Khurram shockingly & bravely runs towards her .Finally when Haider could've had his revenge & has conflicting voices of his father in his mind clashing with his grand-father's & mother's, he walks away. His grand father & Gazala's voice prevailed.",

Director Bhardwaj's mise-en-scene actually is a reminiscent of European cinema added with some Hollywood style direction and even Korean cinema-type violence. With a tinge of realism, this narrative cinema based film scores with it's moments, characters, twists and thrills added with a beautiful music score. Despite striking a great 'Chutzpah', the film lags behind from the director's earlier adaptations like 'Maqbool' because of the romantic quotient which was slightly more than required and where song placement actually seems useless and even few of the moments, especially in the pre-climax, the director strays in between in keeping the thrills on. Overall, the production design work by Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray, editing by Aarif Sheikh and costume design by Dolly Ahluwalia Tewari are the stars in the technical side. Moreover the cinematography by Pankaj Kumar deserves a standing ovation for making Kashmir come alive beautifully through his excellent cinematography. Music score and even the dialogues by the director himself are very well-worked and presented. In the cast, Irrfan in his cameo along with Tabu and Kay Kay Menon in supporting cast are brilliant and riveting with Tabu giving an award-winning performance. Shraddha Kapoor shows some maturity, yet she has a long way to go. Last but not the least, Shahid Kapoor as the troubled Kashmiri youngster who takes on the baddies for \"Intekam\" is great and comes out with one of his best performances till date and he displays excellence in his character development on screen. Overall, this thrilling, chilling and also soothing cinematic experience by Bhardwaj is actually a worth your ticket.",

Haider set in the insurgent Kashmir valley is based on Shakespearian play Hamlet, completing a trilogy by Vishal Bharadwaj after Maqbool and Omkara. It's a story about thousands of Kashmiris getting \"disappeared\" under the pre-text of AFSPA. The entire plot is very intricate, deep and intense comprising Haider's (played by Shahid Kapur) quest to find his disappeared father and bring the perpetrators to justice. With a brilliant cast and screenplay, Vishal Bharadwaj mesmerizes the audience with his allegorical references like the unpredictable nature of woman, dichotomy between righteousness and being wronged, \"Hum hai ki hum nahi hai\" reflecting Kashmir's separatist demand (Kashmir is in fact a character itself), etc. Also movie contains tiny visual character references like Tabu's (mother of Haider) mehndi being prominently displayed multiple times to perhaps indicate her serial widowhood, Haider's wounded eye to perhaps imply his inability to judge the right from the wrong, etc. The beauty of the movie is its unpredictable climax which develops out of a prolonged suspense.

Not because everyone died, but because of how they died and how the director's artistic decisions about those deaths detached me from the emotional impact of what was happening.I was totally with Haider's emotional journey up until that point. Shahid does an amazing job in this movie. The pacing of this movie was fabulous. Even at 2 hours 40 ish minutes - I honestly felt like I was only there for about an hour. The movie flows really really well.The extra time given to the back story really helps cement the emotional impact of what is happening in this story. I was in tears halfway through this movie. The part that is \"technically\" Hamlet starts in earnest in the 2nd half of this movie.According to a friend, the India release had 41 segments edited out to please Indian censors - which means the movie we saw in America is not the movie shown in India. I really hope that when this comes out on video - we get the Indian release, because what was edited out - would probably make this movie better. Had it not been for the ending, I probably would have given this movie 10 stars. I honestly feel cheated by the ending I saw. *spoiler* I should have been emotionally moved by the final confrontation between Haider and his uncle. Instead, I was wondering why Vishal (the director) choose to steal from Star Wars III where Anakin is crawling legless up a hill on that lava planet. Which means when Haider finally is forced to decide to revenge his father or not, I was totally divorced emotionally from what was happening because my focus was on the fact that the uncle had lost his legs pretty gratuitously. It was a bad artistic choice because my focus should have been on the emotional decision Haider was making. Again, this was the only part of the movie I didn't like. Unfortunately, this choice basically ruined the ending. The entire rest of the movie was perfect, even if a bit violently gratuitous. I also enjoyed the western style love scene between Haider and Ashree/Ophelia. I'm sure Indians didn't get to see that because it was positively pornographic by Indian standards. But from a western viewpoint - it was VERY sexy and helped to give context to how Haider feels about Ashree/Ophelia so that we better understand his reaction to her death later.I did feel that we were cheated of his response to her funeral a bit too because the duel between Hamlet and Ophelia's brother happens right at the funeral in this movie and Haider isn't given much time to grieve. But I did think that the duel was well realized. This was an absolutely fabulous movie with the exception of the last 5 minutes of the film, which could be easily fixed if the distraction of the loss of the uncles legs is edited out. Don't let that stop you from seeing this movie, just try to see the Indian censored version if you do.",

Has there been better adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet? I don't know, but this is as good as it gets. Vishal and the whole team has given everything possible to make this master-piece. The story in the fore-front is direct adaptation from tragedy play Hamlet, with son looking for his lost/murdered father, his mother getting in relationship with his uncle, son seeking revenge, and mom & son still longing for each other. The story in the backdrop is from 1995 Kashmir, where young kashmiri lads are pushed onto one side or the other, army/police/state seeking control of the valley, and a few just playing everyone and benefiting from the misfortunes of the others. In the first half, both the stories are competing with each other to get the focal role. Second half is mostly about the main story. First half is the build-up of the plot, characters and their emotions. Second half (immediately after that cameo from my favorite Irrfan Khan) is where it explodes in all directions. Tabu is amazing and awesome, and even better than she was in Maqbool. Her character is a blend of three different roles - conniving adulteress, a dejected wife, and insanely loving mother. The way she calls her son \"Jaanam\", the way she parts from Shahid after kissing him thrice, the wedding mehandi on her hands (with Bhardwaj making sure that people notice it) - it was all so touching that you can feel yourself to be a part of the story. Shahid's chocolaty and not-so-kashmiri & never-gonna-be-old face doesn't go well with the role of a tragedy prince hamlet. I might have preferred someone else, but might have very limited options to find somebody young and talented enough to play this role, with a girl like Shraddha Kapoor swooning after him. But, to be fair with Shahid, he was definitely very good, especially after he goes bald and have that touch of insanity. Kay Kay was very good too, but lets agree that he has done better roles. I would have liked to see more of Irrfan Khan. Shraddha Kapoor was convincing in her role of love- smitten young naive girl.Movie gets A+ on the cinematography - we humans have literally wasted this paradise on earth - Kashmir in its pure raw form hasn't ever looked more beautiful. The camera work and screenplay is amazing, especially in those long mother & son scenes. The background score is so original and refreshing - really liked the parts, where it start playing tunes from some of the yester-year movies. Dialogues are direct adaptation from Hamlet and completely apt in this movie story-line. The \"to be or not to be\" rendition is simply amazing. I won't say its a perfect movie - could not understand the relevance of that romantic song; shaved chest of shahid kapoor in 1990's kashmir would be hard to explain; gravediggers' poster looked much better than that scene in the movie; and probably could have leveraged those two salman's even more for few more lighter moments. Overall, movie is a masterpiece and is a must must watch!",

            "content": "Only Vishal Bhardwaj could have thought of giving Hamlet the tinge of poetry, wit and yet ironically set it in a troubled Kashmir. There is a keenness in the way he handles the subject. From Peer's judgement of Kashmir in 1995 to the performances Bhardwaj extracts from his cast, it's all exquisitely done, beyond words can express.Story: Haider (Shahid Kapoor) is a poetry student who is forced to return home when his father (Narendra Jha) disappears. Taken into custody for keeping a militant at his place, the doctor has gone missing. Haider returns to find his mother laughing with his chacha, hinting at a strong relationship between them. Ghazala (Tabu) from the onset is a tugging prop between Haider and Khurram (Kay Kay Menon). Amidst his life falling apart, his only solace is his fianc\u00e9 Arshiya (Shraddha Kapoor) a righteous journalist.Haider is hell bent on finding out what happens to his father and clues take through a journey where deceit is the norm and the most unlikely people have been disloyal to his Abbuji. Haider's motive becomes revenge and does he succeed in it at all is what the film narrates.Performances: When it comes to performances, everyone is on the same page in this film. Shahid Kapoor brings out his genetic brilliance and gives an ace performance. From covering Hamlet's vulnerability to his anger about deceit, Kapoor delivers it all with breathtaking valor and immense sincerity. He slips from frame to frame, mood to mood with precision and ease that only someone who is convinced and confident can get.Shraddha Kapoor as Oephilia or Arshiya as in the film, is great. Beautiful, innocent and smooth, she is better than most of her ungrateful roles.Tabu brings her own to Gertrude. She plays Ghazala with flair and gets a haunting quality to her silence. When her son tells her she has two faces, the heartbreak shows on her face. Her beauty is such in the film that it reflects her state of mind. Her happiness speaks through her eyes, her pain shows even before she has slapped her son to express the same. Only Tabu could have brought alive Gertrude in Ghazala.Irrfan Khan in few scenes in the film, is pitch perfect. He is the Quintessential Shakespearean prop that drives Hamlet and the actor is at his wicked best. Treat yourself if you can replicate his 'Badla'. So much said in one word!Kay Kay Menon is far away from his last few stints and gives Claudius (Khurram) his own color. I loved how his demeanor shifted in the presence of different people. Earnestly loving towards Ghazala, he is genuinely venomous towards Haider and Menon does it with utmost brilliance.Narendra Jha has little to play but is smashing in his minuscule part.Direction & screenplay: Usually such films are candid expressions of the filmmaker's vision and Haider is no less. To create the tapestry of Haider could not possibly have been an easy task. Of course his repertoire shows he is capable of it but dealing with a plethora of emotions, blending them in the same film is only his cup of tea. He has used so much literature in his film, that it is an absolute delight to watch. There is a scene where Haider is looking through a pile of stenching bodies and suddenly wakes up a person who had survived whatever had happened to the rest of them. He wakes up, jumps out of the truck and dances in celebration. Such are relieving scenes in the film.Bharadwaj's vision is clear. At the onset itself you know where his characters are heading and he keeps the journey interesting still. There are no confused hiccups or moments where the filmmaker is self consumed. The iconic graveyard scene is beautifully translated and you are bound to sit with a lump in your throat.The last word: Haider is a rare film that will go down in cinematic history as a bold move that detaches Kashmir from the its usual depictions and dares to lay it bare. Talks of ghost ids, demilitarization of the state, the plebiscite that never happened are all issues mainstream cinema probably have never even heard of. Bhardwaj conjures up a heart wrenching tale of betrayal, loyalty, love, angst, pain and a man torn between them all. I am sure no one except Vishal could have stayed so true to Hamlet and made something so different from it. The performances are top notch but what works the best about Haider is its unpredictability. Even if you are fluent with Hamlet, there will be a lot you can take away from Haider. I guess, this film is the best all those who are associated with it can get.I go with 9/10.",

            "content": "As long as the audience is not expected to have any kind of sympathy towards the characters - Haider, Roohdar and the Doctor(Haider's father) - and are not expected to kinda curse or hate the Indian militants, Tabu's character and Khurram(KK Menon), in the movie, THEN it is completely an appreciable movie. In a nutshell, Vishal Bharadwaj has demonstrated the other side of the coin. I didn't get disturbed at all by the sorrowful scenes like when the doctor's house is blasted off, or when Haider's father is tortured and killed by militants, or when Haider is beaten up badly.. Such scenes rather made me feel happy. That is because the character 'Haider' himself is supporting the cruel. If Haider was an Indian and he knew that his father was a terrorist, then why would he opt for Sarhad Paar and take his father's so called 'Intequam' to kill his uncle? Also another twist which I found irrelevant is why would Tabu approach Irrfan Khan at the end? So, personally, I loved the script and believe that it definitely deserved all the awards but it could've been taken in a different reference.",

So I was naturally inclined to watch this film, and Vishal Bhardwaj nailed it!A great way to portray Kashmir issue in the form of Hamlet. In the beginning it did not feel like Hamlet, but boy did it pack a punch.Shahid Kapoor nailed his role, absolutely loved him, especially in the second half. Tabu was so good, her eyes are so expressive. Kay Kay Menon also did a phenomenal job and the extended cameo by Irrfan Khan was just icing on the cake. Great cinematography, great storyline and the screenplay did lag sometimes for me personally, but I was in love with this film that I could just stare at it for hours. Vishal's own personal twists were too good, and the 'Bismil' song was just beautifully picturised. The music was excellent, this is probably my most favourite album of Vishal Bhardwaj. This man is incredibly talented! Special shoutout to Gulzar Sahab for some astounding lyrics.A great watch for those who adore Shakespeare but may not be entertaining for those who don't care about Hamlet or Shakespeare. A 10/10 from me!",

The mother-son touch was great side-kick, but calling this movie \"based on play of Hamlet\" - that's kind of sad.Also the plot hole was to big to be ignored- When police try to trace Roohdar's telephone number, they are not able to do so.

            "content": "Vishal Bharadwaj completes a trilogy of adapting Shakespearean plays with Haider. Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello) being the previously adapted ones and now with Haider inspired from Hamlet, it completes a perfect trilogy. An intense family revenge drama, Haider is truly a masterpiece set in Kashmir caught in political turmoil and what that makes it a brilliant film is beyond doubt the performances from Shahid Kapoor and Tabu. Not to forget the visual treat we experience with the locales of beautiful Kashmir that elevates the film to another level. The story is set in Kashmir in the mid 1990's where militancy and military occupying centre stage. Haider (Shahid Kapoor) is a student at Aligarh and his father Dr.Milal mysteriously disappear leaving his wife Ghazala played by Tabu and young Haider in tatters. When Haider learns about the actual reason for his father's vanishing, his mind gets broken and revenge creeps into the young man's mind. Rest of the movie focus on the mental aspect and conflict within Haider after the realization of truth. Film narrate this revenge drama packed with solid writing and backed up by performances with excellent direction from VB. For those who cannot sit patiently and watch slow films will find it a bit difficult to cop with and to get to terms with the movie as the build up is quite slow and it takes time to settle amidst the presence of class written all over. As said earlier, performances, writing, direction and presence of Kashmir on the visual side is what that makes this film a must watch for ardent lovers of class films.It seems Shahid Kapoor had reserved his best for this movie and comes up with a performance that will surprise everyone. We could feel the change in him that transform Haider to the revengeful man with varied emotions and this was done brilliantly. Same goes for Tabu as Haider's mother Ghazala. These two are well supported by Kay Kay Menon as Haider's uncle Khurram and Shraddha Kapoor as Haider's lady love. Also it would be unjust if a word of mention is not made about Irrfan Khan's extended cameo. Cinematography is another highlight helped by superb visuals of Kashmir to make each and every frame a treat for our eyes. Edits were fine. Songs were really nice with visuals and good background score matching each moment provided the needed feel lifted the film's technical side.On the whole, a dark but remarkable and haunting piece of work is this latest movie of Vishal Bharadwaj. I personally recommend this film to everyone who love to watch something that has a quality stamp affixed all over.",

Unlike rest of recent Bollywood films, the songs help deepen the intensity of the situation - if one follows the lyrics (even the English translations) they help to bring the audience closer to the emotions of on-screen characters. Haider's Bismil song - which is a theater/stage act was an audio-visual treat. The dialogs throughout justify the cultural background giving natural touch to the storyline.

He manages the many shifts of mood skilfully but always appears like an actor performing a role gamely instead of an actor who has become the character: he's very good, just not as unaffected as the actors around him.The result is a knockout, a film that makes you smell corpses, that makes you shudder with melancholia, and a film that points accusing fingers.

Shahid is one of those mediocre actors who flourishes and is a whole different person when working with a good director. Coming to the movie, just like other adaptations from Vishal Bhardwaj this movie is set in unexpected situation. Who can imagine Hamlet being set up in Kashmir, not beautiful Kashmir we love from Shammi Kapoor era, but Kashmir that is bursting of tension. Haider's father is caught by army while he was trying to operate a militant Haider comes back to Kashmir and he finds that his mom Gazala played by Tabu is getting exceedingly close to his uncle Kay Kay Menon. He is clearly not comfortable by this and he is led to the confusion that they are rather happy in the whole situation. His love interest is played by Shradhha Kapoor who has done up to standard acting. While Shahid is searching for his father, director has shown through various scenes the violations of human rights on Kashmir people by Army. Shahid is slowly losing patience and his mind, and that's when he meets Irrfan who informs him that his father is dead and he has given the message to Shahid to avenge his death and kill Kay Kay Menon. Kay Kay Menon also tells him completely different story about his father's situation of missing and his death. Now now now that's when protagonist is faced with the dilemma to be or not be? Me hu ke nai? Haum hai ke nahi? Cinematography is purely marvelous. But you will not feel pleasure , you will be aware of tension that is always there. Music is great, you will not listen to this songs again maybe but they compliment story. Screenplay is might seem a little slow acting of every actor is par excellence. Tabu has shown she is the best actor for roles with different layers, Kay Kay is under rated he deserves a special mention. Shahid is superior. Overall it is easily one of the top 10 movies of this year. You would take many thing from this movie with you such as dialogues of Irrfan, Salman Khan , Chutzpah and English that is used in movie from many characters among many other things. Now coming to the issue of portrayal of Kashmir and Indian Army, yes it Biased. With capital B. how a doctor who is trying to save a terrorist without informing his own country's army, might be difficult to understand for many. On a particular scene where he is asked by wife, aap kis side par he? He replied Jindgi ki side par Which sounds lame. But banning or boycott of it might not be a solution, because since when political movies are expected to be neutral? It also shows how innocent citizens are fooled are misled by terrorists for their ultimate goals but it is too little. One of my personal opinion is political movies should not be made on real stories, because 90 % cases, we rarely know the truth, we are fed by propaganda by media and based on that a movie is made sounds bit illogical. Remember Rambo movie, I forgot which was it, but it showed an American trying to save AFGHAN people from Russians, looks very funny after 15-20 years now. Rating this movie among other adaptation of Shakespeare by Vishal I would be place them as follow:1.Omkara 2. Maqbool 3. Haider i give this 8/10.",

Based on Shakespeare's Hamlet the action transpires in war ravaged Kashmir region. Shahid Kapoor is fantastic as the young son hell bent on revenge and every actor from Tabu to Narendra Jha gives this film their absolute best. The cinematography is good, but the plot and characters take precedence in this film. Very few Bollywood films are as effective as Haider- Give this one a chance and you will be surprised.",

            "content": "There's a startling quality in all of Vishal Bhardwaj's movies. Be it his masterful Omkara or the unabashedly 'Pulp Fiction' Kaminey, the uninhibited passion of the man for his craft shines through. Not caring about standard Bollywood song-and-dance tropes, the audacious man goes on carving his own legacy. And how!Haider, the third of Bhardwaj's Shakespearean adaptation (after Maqbool and Omkara) takes the Bard's most famous tragedy, and concocts a dastardly tale of love, insurgency and revenge. To call Haider just a movie would be insulting. This is free- flowing, effortless poetry in motion. Set amidst the grief-stricken Kashmir that we hardly see on the silverscreen , it's safe to say that Haider is the best movie to come out of Bollywood in ages. Revealing the plot would be a travesty. This is an experience each one of us should enjoy individually! Shahid Kapoor as the eponymous protagonist has outdone himself here. Admittedly, I've not been his greatest fan, but with this movie he's set a standard that very few actors can hope to actually level, far less top. His silence, and his piercing gaze speaks volumes. Kay Kay Menon as the wily uncle Khurram, and the ever-so-gorgeous Tabu as Haider's mother Ghazala suit their role to the T. Even the supporting cast of lesser-known actors stand out! Watch out specially for the two Salmans who provide the only comic relief in this brooding tale of revenge.Haider starts of slowly, giving us a glimpse of all the characters, and their motives, leaving us wanting to know more. And then there's a delightful Irrfan Khan cameo, setting us up for an exhilarating ride!It has been a while since a movie made my jaw drop. Haider accomplished that feat for two hours. One magnificent scene after other kept coming in, at a relentless pace, leaving me gasp for more!The picturisation of the Bismil song is the best I've seen in a movie. Ever. The crescendo reaches another level here, weaving together Gulzar's vividly descriptive lyrics. The Shahid Kapoor monologue in the city marketplace, citing the sections of the AFSPA law is his crowning jewel amongst so many starling scenes in the movie.The music and background score fit perfectly! It's a shame Bhardwaj composes so little. The Aao Na song is alone worth the price of the ticket. Check out the hauntingly stunning gravediggers version of the song, it's guaranteed to give you goosebumps!There are multiple moments in the movie where you want to just stand up and clap at the audaciousness...-no wait, CHUTZPAH, of the director, breaking down every single conventional Bollywood formula. Scenes depicting the Oedipus complex are handled so sensitively, that it comes across as believable rather than vulgar. Want more proof? It's not often that I'd feel like whistling when our hero outsmarts two Salmans just to show his chutzpah, in a way that 'bhai' would be proud of! All in all, Haider is Vishal Bhardwaj's masterpiece! It's a piece of cinematic memorabilia that should be celebrated and revered. To see or not to see? Do you even need to ask?!",

It is a beautiful article that capture the pain of Kashmir and how this movie tries to give us a glimpse of it and that there is so much worse stuff that happens that they couldn't put on screen as it wouldn't pass censors. So so sad.The music was beautiful. I don't agree with others though when they say there's an Oedipus Complex in this movie.The connection of Shahid/Haider to his parents is extremely amazing though. He's out to avenge his dad, his mother is guilty in a twisted way, yet Haider still respects his mom. But in the end we see that she really didn't know.The only scene I think was over exaggerated is when Haider takes out the two Salmans. The rifle they took from Haider just ran out of bullets. I was hoping that Haider like took out the ammo and purposefully made it look like they got the gun to test to see if they would shoot. Then as they ran the way he got them was really weird. Also when Haider single shots that DSP/SSP it's a real lucky shot. So just these two real luck moments were the only weak parts for me.",

Cinematography is also poor. The only good thing to speak about the movie is the locations the movie was shot. Shahid Kapoor acted well, but the movie was dragged a lot with unnecessary scenes. People literally fell asleep after watching the first half and didn't turn up for the second half as they have taken enough of it. I expected something great to be happening in the second half, after an interesting interval, but it was the same thing.Haider is a different kind of genre which fails to shine with its poor screenplay, direction and cinematography.P.S. - People please rate the movie genuinely, i'm really shocked on seeing the movie being rated 9/10, whereas much more good movies are being rated only 7-8.",

So, I would like to ask people to read about the situation rather than drawing conclusions from the movie.Yes, there have been instances when Indian soldiers have harassed people in Kashmir but that is not the full picture. There have been instances where Indian soldiers have been portrayed bad just to mislead people. And we must keep in mind that Indian army has done a lot for people there.

            "review_title": "Best Feeling in A Cinematic motion! Hat's off!",
            "content": "A Bollywood adaptation of William Shakespeare's Hamlet with a sense of realism. Isn't it? Why are you asking questions to the makers? Ask Shakespeare who made the performance tougher but yet what an adaptation it was! The singer, music director and filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj had nailed it. This is the final of the Shakespeare Trilogy after Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello). Haider is starred by a renowned actor of Bollywood, Shahid Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, the National Award Winning Actress Tabu and Kay Kay Menon but most of all the household name Irrfan Khan. The story is based on Kashmir riots during the 1990s. It's about a doctor who was disappeared during the riots. Due to that, his son Haider arrives the scene until he learned about his uncle's and mother's closeness, his life became even complicated. Will he find his father? Or be derailed by the society who misunderstood him? I learned something from Haider that 'we are not born as a criminal but society made us a criminal'. Yet there are lots of differences regarding the length of Hamlet and Haider but also the stretch of the story. The supernatural theme of Hamlet has been modified into a dream sequence and a realism sense. The leading lady plays a dual role of a friend and lover (Horatio and Ophelia) which is superb in many ways but had to be a little more tightened, Shahid as Haider had done a justice to the role as Hamlet with its main attraction- fake madness, Tabu as Ghazala (Gertitude) deserves the actual credit as a mother and Kay Kay Menon as Khurram's (Claudius) performance is menacing but a little less than Shahid's menacing act. We clap while Irrfan Khan enters the scene before the interval- splendid act according to my perspective. The director, Vishal Bhardwaj proved that we all have characteristics like Hamlet even in the world. Yet, it is a controversial subject but according to my perspective really the memorable one ever. The winter of Kashmir was beautifully pictured as we get a feeling of a Gothic atmosphere but the most disturbing part is the flashbacks where the entire plot stands. The dialogs are the main standpoint of the film where we could understand the story but of course, it was rich and tight. Though it has 41 cuts as said in the interviews or articles, the movie is really a soothing piece of work. The story is logical, true to Hamlet with a lot of political and sexual developments within the plot itself but a little chopped off that should not be noted as mentioned above. As most of us know the story of Hamlet, the story can be retold in many ways. The music background had a realistic feeling but of a typical Bhardwaj, still it was more of a soothing feeling but at the same time it sets the mood of the film. The in my perspective two best tracks in the score was 'Bismil' based upon the play within a play 'The Murder of Gonzalo' and 'Aao Na' is based on the whole story. Both of the tracks deserve an intense feeling of revenge, social norms and the story. Overall, it is far the best movie of 2014 after another movie, Ek Villain which is also another movie to get chills. It is a must watch for people who keeps their cool mind as they want to learn something as to judge a character. A mother's love is immortal and people are unpredictable even they are sane or insane. If you need a friend to share, help them to trust you and trust them as well but regarding their actions keep your eyes sharp. If you did not watch Haider, watch it if you want to judge a character and create your personality. A brilliant film to deliver with a picture that sooths our mind.",

Somehow, the writer could not assimilate the story of deceit and irony of Kashmir. I accept that its a very difficult task as both stories need judgment but that could not be performed to either.Haider's war was not for Kashmir, it was a very personal issue but he was ready to go across border for what? Haider tells the story of murder of his father in a song following marriage vows, but he comes without revolver, why? Everybody was aware that Haider is after his uncle, but he is sedated and kept in the same house without any custody for him, why? Irfan Khan's rope opens all of a sudden in Jhelum while drowning and he is saved even with so many bullets, how? The story runs very slow, howsoever good may be the coffee, a very prolonged brewing time kills the taste. Now the good part of the film is superb performance by Shahid and Tabu. In a tragic scene, no one can compete with Tabu. For Shahid, it would be a feather in his cap after Kaminey. In scenes of resentment and vengeance, his saliva drools over his beard and his eyes speaks for his pain. KK Menon has justified his presence especially in a few scenes like \"Arey Princess, Prince Kahan Hai\", you can appreciate the very shrewdness of his character. Shraddha Kapoor does not has much to do in the movie. Her looks justifies her role as a Kashmiri girl but her acting is on back foot in some scenes like arguments with her father. I can simply summarize, it was not up to the earlier set standards by the director. ......",

            "content": "Just watched Haider. The reason i watched it is because my lovely friends on facebook have been good enough to provide some outstanding reviews for the movie. Personally, i was rather disappointed with it. This movie had potential. Adaptations of Shakespearean plays are hard as it is but remaking it in a political setting in 90s Kashmir was a good idea. Added context to the whole thing. (SPOILER ALERT) The thing about the story is that in the original play there is a sense of finality to the proceedings in the end though in a rather chaotic way (Claudius, Laertes and Hamlet are all killed by the same god-damned poisoned sword) At the end of the day, the protagonist and all the people he loves dies. Thats what makes it a tragedy. But more importantly it finishes the story. Hamlet NEEDS to kill Claudius in order to complete it. Leaving him alive would undermine the premise of the play itself (which is revenge) . Haider decides to add a sense of morality to the proceedings. There is an inherent theme in the movie about revenge. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. That sort of thing. To spread a message of how revenge is unnecessary and harmful to everyone, the writers decide to leave out the crucial part where Haider kills his uncle. Sure he leaves him badly injured with both his legs blown off and begging for death. But the point is he MAY have survived it, which defeats the entire purpose of the movie, unless the purpose was to give a moral lesson to everyone in which case basing it off Hamlet is idiotic. In other respects it keeps remarkably close to the original story line. We see enough of the underlying Oedipus complex between Haider and his mother. Several times he's shown to apply perfume to her neck before kissing it and towards the end she even gives him a kiss very close to the lips if not on the lips. The madness that engulfs Haider is very well done and gives a sense of shock when you first encounter it especially the fact that you don't recognize the main protagonist until his mother does. Even the play that Hamlet puts on to accuse his Uncle has been remade excellently into a song-and- dance. The grave diggers are there. Haider digs up a skull. All of it recognizable to avid Shakespearean fans. One disappointing thing is the portrayal of Rosencrantz and Gildenstern as Salman and Salman who seem to basically be there for comic relief right until their very brutal murders at the hands of Haider The cinematography however was excellent and you really are spellbound by some of the scenes especially with the beautiful backdrop of Kashmir. All in all, I'd say say this movie is worth the watch even if it does get a little tedious at first. Shakespeare fans out there might cringe at the deviation at the end but otherwise its a rather solid movie",

Moreover, it also shows the viewers what life in Kashmir was like under the army rule. Shahid Kapoor's portrayal of Haider is his best work yet.His transformation from a straight forward college student who is shocked by his father's disappearance and his mother's extramarital affair with his uncle to a revenge seeking madman is just outstanding.Hard to believe that this is the same guy who gave us duds like R Rajkumar.He probably might scoop up all the best actor awards this year. Kay Kay Menon is brilliant as the scheming lecherous uncle and so is Narendra Jha as Haider's father. Shraddha Kapoor is good as Haider's girlfriend.Bhardwaj alumnus Irrfan Khan gave us one of the best Bollywood cameos of all time.He literally gets a rock star introduction in the film. He is sophisticated and ruthless in his role as the militant Roohdar and also has the best dialogues in the film.The two sidekicks who are die-hard Salman Khan fans(Bhaitards) provide us with the most laughs in the film.Their impressions of BHAI and his dialogues make us wonder if Bhardwaj is paying tribute to or mocking Salman Khan in the film. But this film belongs to Tabu. She is so goddamn brilliant as Haider's mother. All her emotions are so well depicted on screen. She steals the show in every scene of the film.Vishal Bhardwaj has also depicted the weirdly close relationship between Haider and his mother with sensitivity.Violence,murder and revenge are the main themes of Shakespearen works and Haider captures them brilliantly. This is not something you get to see in a mainstream Bollywood movie. The only negative part of the film is the unnecessary love song between Shahid and Shraddha which was possibly inserted in the film to appeal to the mainstream audience. Otherwise this is hands down the best Bollywood movie of 2014 and one of the top 5 movies in the last decade. DO NOT MISS HAIDER!",

            "review_title": "Shahid Kapoor proves he's the best Bollywood actor of his generation in this timeless masterpiece.",
            "content": "This film is basically poetry in motion. While the political issues forming its backdrop may be controversial, it attempts to be unbiased in its assessment. But this is a work of fiction, and those issues only form its backdrop. It is essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet, and a great one at that.The story starts off in Kashmir with Dr. Hilaal Meer (played by Narendra Jha), who gets captured by the Indian army after tending to an injured militant. The story then flashes forward to his son Haider's (played by Shahid Kapoor) return home, who is dismayed by the news of his father's disappearance and his mother Ghazala's (played by Tabu) affair with his uncle Khurram (played by Kay Kay Menon). As he searches all over for his father, a mysterious man named Roohdaar (played by Irrfan Khan) arrives with an unfortunate message: his father is dead, and that his death was staged by Khurram. The rest of the story deals with Haider's descent into madness as he carries out his plan for revenge.In short, this film is well-written (such poetic dialogues, oh God), well-shot and brilliantly acted. There are numerous differences between the film and the Hamlet play itself, but the movie captures the spirit of the play.Coming to the performances, Tabu proves why she's one of the best actresses of India by giving a brilliant performance that conveys all the complexities of the character. You can clearly see the heartbreak in her eyes. It almost hurts you. It wouldn't be wrong to say that she should be grabbing all Best Actress awards for this year. Those awards are practically begging to be clasped in her hands. Kay Kay Menon is amazing. Simply amazing. His Khurram displays subtle hints of pure evil, but also displays genuine affection for Ghazala. A totally believable character come to life through a masterclass performance. Though weak in a few scenes, Shraddha Kapoor is surprisingly good throughout most of the film. She is definitely improving as an actress ( can't say the same for Katrina Kaif). Irrfan Khan's cameo is enough to make you believe that he is an actor of unmatched caliber. The way he said \"badla\" will forever haunt me. Narendra Jha makes an impression despite having very little screen time. All actors in small roles did their parts well.And last but not least,Shahid Kapoor.......you beauty. You talented beauty. The show- stealer of this masterpiece. The man who starred in a string of romantic comedies before garnering acclaim and respect for his double role in Kaminey (a benchmark for double roles and perhaps one of the most impressive performances by a Bollywood actor of the 21st century), gets deep into the skin of his character and performs like a veteran actor. In the first half of the film, he doesn't speak much but his eyes do most of the talking. The pain, shock and disappointment, it's all there. And done beautifully. Such impressive subtlety. In the second half, he goes balls-out and conveys the madness and the rage building up inside him. Every nuance, dialogue delivery, expression etc is pitch perfect. Most of the best scenes belong to him. This is not the performance of a lifetime. This is the performance of 7 lifetimes. I hope all that talk about him winning a National Award for this comes true because he certainly deserves it. This is undoubtedly his career-best performance and it proves that he is easily the best Bollywood actor of his generation, placing him miles ahead of his contemporaries.",

But ages after ZNMD, I've been led to play with fingers and extol this immensely gripping display of exalted cinema.Well, Haider is a Typical Vishal Bhardwaj Movie! Maqbool, Omkara & now Haider. Shakespearean beauty brought live (again) on Indian cinemas. I am personally thankful to this man who has always dared to come up with such audacious projects. While as we all witness Indian cinema bleeding with folly movies like Chennai Express ,Dhoom 3 and similar other like most recent Kick, this particular movie is a pleasant surprise. Its like travelling from wounds to wisdom for a particular class of cinema lovers.It has the capacity to satisfy & saturate the quest of most of the people who have been eager to watch good, sensible and a speaking movie content for a long-long time!Unmentionable though, movie is a well directed adaption of Tragedy Hamlet. Set in mid 90's of Kashmir conflict era, movie starts of with a wonderful prologue and marks a perfect entry of Protagonist. Early expressions of Shahid Kapoor are worthy of special appreciation. Transit of emotions displayed to introduce Kay Kay Menon on screen was just lovely and clearly one can start absorbing the diversions b/w an ordinary flick & an extraordinary one.Tabu is mesmerizing & has acted with sublime maturity. Screen play, story line and the way director carries the movie with fine developments in get up of Shahid Kapoor is another brilliant thing to notice. Particular scene where Shahid Kapoor converses with Tabu is probably the best from Pre-interval show.Shradhha Kapoor is soothing on screen and has done sufficient justice with her role. Eye grabbing performance from Irfann khan is just a sugar coating and cherry on cake. No words can exactly compensate his prowess. Second half carries the movie to altogether different altitude and mark my word Shahid Kapoor will surely take everyone with surprise. He's a quality actor who's just underrated. This movie is undoubtedly going to take him to new heights. He's brilliant & his out of the box acting in this movie is unparalleled to what he has done in past. If Omkara was a new birth to Saif Ali Khan, Haider should be a new birth to Shahid.Picturisation, photography, music, dialogues, casting, make up, dance, In Second half of the movie you'll see everything well placed and in decent quantity & quality.On the overall an overwhelming experience. And yes, Kashmir has been eloquently presented with grace & culture has been shown in true bright light!Watch it for the sake of appreciating good quality work. Rating :9/10.",

The people of Kashmir are witness to the war crimes, including rapes, killings of civilians, fake encounters, custodial killings, enforced disappearances and exploitation in each and every way possible. One lac people have been killed and thousands raped, orphaned and widowed in Kashmir, and then there are laws like AFSPA and PSA that let such things go unpunished as well as encourage them. For medals and promotions, most of the encounters have been fake. Kashmir has witnessed hundreds of Mumbai type of shootings (Ajmal Kasaf) by security forces on protesters, and hundreds of Delhi type of rapes by these so called heroes in uniform. Kashmir is the only state in India where protesters are fired in the heads and chest, not legs, and that too without any warning. During 90s, rapes and killings were something too normal, such things happened on a daily basis, and still since last 25 years the Indian media has been lying about Kashmir to its people, has been projecting the rapists and killers as heroes, media and nationalism has turned people blind who can't see or feel the pain and sufferings that have been inflicted on Kashmiri people by the Indian occupation, with 8 lac soldiers in Kashmir making it the most densely militarized zone in the world. Past can be forgiven and forgotten, but not when things don't improve, when no one is punished (not even for the incidents like Kanunposhpora and other similar incidents), when lives of people are made worse every day by different inhuman Israeli kind of tactics.",

            "content": "Haider set in Kashmir of 1995, when the paradise was burning and people were either leaving their homes or dying or going missing. Vishal Bhardwaj chooses to tell his interpretation of Hamlet in that background. Hamlet is known for his dilemma, his delays in taking revenge, his feigned madness, his soliloquy and his sense of loss and futility of it all\u0085Vishal interpreters these in our own cultural context. The story is of a middle class family caught in the turmoil of planned murder, greed for power and betrayal. A doctor treats a wounded terrorist and his world turns upside down. Betrayed, caught by the army he goes missing. The film traces the journey of his poet son searching for his father; finding the traitors and taking revenge. The film begins at his burned down house and culminates in a graveyard strewn with dead bodies. Pankaj Kumar's un-touristy camera saunters into the life of Kashmir never shown before. People walking in narrow lanes, a woman in her kitchen and half-widows languishing in wait for the turn of their missing husbands. Gulzar said that Vishal has 'captured the history of Kashmir'. Vishal completes his trilogy on Shakespeare with Haider, after Maqbool and Omkara, with his tried and trusted crew. The actors honoured his faith and have inhabited their characters deeply; deep to the core. The scene where Shahid returns home, after his father disappears, and finds his mother sitting by the window, glowing, giggling to the foolish singing and dancing of his uncle stands out. Shahid watches them and expresses his disgust with tears, sadness and anger. Shahid as Haider oscillates between his personal grief and a desire for revenge. Must he murder to avenge a murder? He loved his father but he loved his mother more. In the end, he listens to his mother. That is a change from Hamlet, the play. Shahid would be remembered as Haider a long time. Shraddha, as Arshia, is in the role of Ophelia. She plays a journalist. She loves Haider. Haider too loves her but there is not much place left in his heart for her as it is consumed with hatred towards his uncle and mother. His mission is revenge not love. The love making scene with Haider and Arshia is filmed with much sensitivity. The room is glowing with wood fire and the love between them flickers, leaps up like an unbridled flame and slows down with Arshia getting a premonition of violence leading to death. Death of people, place and things they hold close to their hearts. She brings an unspoilt, eternal virgin beauty of Kashmir and a Kashmiri girl. Tabu excels in her character as Ghazala, Haider's mother, Gertrude, the queen in the play. She essays the mother, the wife, and also a woman longing to be loved. Vishal's challenge must have been whether to portray Ghazala, as a queen devoted to her king and a loving mother of Haider or as a co-conspirator with Khurram, the uncle? You got to watch Tabu bring out the layers in her character. To some extent, Haider is her movie as well. Only Tabu could do justice to role of Ghazala. In one scene where she is sitting in front of a mirror and Shahid stands behind her admiring and kissing her on the neck. She is aware of her sexuality which in fact adds fuel to Haider's drive for revenge. The whole Oedipus complex thing gets a new definition. Tabu should come out of Hyderabad more often. Kay Kay brings a whole new dimension to the role of Khurram, Claudius in the play. He is charming and he is evil. His love for Ghazala is true so is his lust for power and money. Kay Kay has come out absolutely brilliant with his performance. Like most of Shakespearean villains, Khurram is not an absolute villain. His conscience pricks him a couple of times. The entry of Roohdar, Irrfan Khan is fantastic. He plays the Ghost from Hamlet. He comes from nowhere but you are sure of one thing that his arrival would now push the story to a fast lane. And it does. Roohdar's character has scar on his right eye and he is lame \u2013 a hint that he has a story of his own. Irrfan is an actor par excellence. The way Vishal has placed and played out Irrfan's character in the film speaks of his craft and vision as a director. Hat's off to you, sir! Music has Vishal's thumb print on it. The song Bismil is choreographed in a fresh way and it takes the narrative forward. The second song that is grim yet beautifully filmed is the Gravediggers' song. Dolly Ahluwalia brings out the stunning beauty of Ghazala and Arshia with brilliant ensemble of colours, maroon, blue and red standing out against the stark white of snow. Haider naturally wears dark shades to go with his internal conflicts. Haider is a film not simply to watch but feast on it.",

For everyone else there is certainly, some \"bhai-movie\" or other Hollywood equivalent alien invasion/war/bloodshed movies.

The sheer courage of the director is what makes this movie stand apart, I don't remember any other bollywood movie speak about AFSPA, Nehru, torture-cells, 90s Kashmir so loud and clear on a national medium right in the face of 1.2 billion people. Talking in terms of current bollywood scenario, it is a very-very easy success-recipe - just copy/paste a movie from south/Hollywood or some other no meaning non-sense from our talented writers, get eye-candy- celebrities, unrealistic fighting scenes, many kisses and bed scenes, gaana-bajaana-thumke-gaaliya and voil\u00e0! SUPERHIT! One will only like (or more so...feel) this film if their hearts pain and bleed along with the people of J&K, and many states of north- east where people undergo and live under inhuman acts every single day from government, police and army. If they have had an actual conversation with them on ground. If they've felt their fear, their helplessness, their hardships, their courage, their will to live...if they could feel all this as their own, they will know what this movie is about. The very mention of those draconian laws on a national medium, serves as a gulp of water to the decades old dried, thirsty throat who is surviving on hope alone.This film will only serve to a certain range of audience, no this is not meant for entertainment, it is made for those people who think out of their hearts not brains. It will appeal to lovers, thinkers, philosophers, poets, theater-admirers, rebels, you know... \"that\" kind of people lol.It covered so many genres. Drama, romance, action, crime and doesn't fall short on hints of comedy too. Let some years pass by, we will realize this film's importance over time. Vishal throws so much on our faces all at once, it will take time to grasp. It's a bit overwhelming too and has to be compared with some world-re-known classic movies to know it's worth. The film is more of a visual poetry/literature. It is less of a cinema and has more of a theater- bend, of-course because of inspiration from Shakespeare. (and the majority of late 80s, 90s and later new-age audience finds his works...umm...wait for it...boring! :P) Well there are many of us who will puke on Scorsese, Tarantino's works or Godfather series and won't be able to even sit through it IMO one can only like a movie, if they can connect some of their own life's memories, passions, fears to it, else not. Happens with all artworks.Talking in terms of film-making, the shots by Pankaj Kapoor were an absolute treat to eyes. Some lyrics from Gulzar sahib. The sound work with respect to the emotion/mood of the scene was heart- touching right from the beautiful kashmiri folk instruments to electro guitars. The bismil sequence! It was a theater-in-theater, proper theater/play sequence inside the medium of movie itself. The budget was low, storytelling might have been a bit slow-paced in other half, but that's the reason some times a blurry photo that has captured SOUL clicked from a Rs. 3000 film camera connects to heart FAR better than a soul-less crystal sharp photo clicked from a Rs. 2,50,000 SLR with fancy lenses and accessories. ...still, to each his own no offense intended :)",

Overall hats off to BV. All the actors are brilliant in their respective roles. Special mention to Shahid Kapoor and the best performance of his career. This shows how a good director can inspire & transform an actor.

            "content": "Hoping for a vivid exclusion from the mainstream movies of B-town, went in with great expectations of the film. By the end of first half, I was truly intrigued and enthralled by the sumptuous locations. Movie had a slow approach to introduce character, the screenplay is just, but it is most likely not liked by the common audience.The idea to show milieu of a confused, fragile boy who is in search of his father amidst the tension set in Kashmir during the 90s was quite a thing to watch. Although there were one too many scenes (for example flirting scene, Salman and Salman intro,etc) in the movie that were upsettingly mainstream, but director made sure that they blended in with the story. What lacked in pace was made up by beautiful locations with astonishing music and brilliant performances by Tabu and Shahid. Shahid in particular did exceptionally wonderful in the scenes where he is first assumed to go missing, the scene where he finds his fathers grave and lastly the climax. Irfan Khan, who shared smaller portion in run time made his presence felt with amazing intonations in his dialogue. Others acting is also noteworthy. Speaking of acting, the Chutzpah Monologue was remarkable, the intonation with which it was delivered and the camera work during the monologue was absolutely worth watching.Direction wise, movie gave me a feel that no other bollywood movie has given me recently. It was a fresh and fascinating experience to watch melancholic conversations set in equally melancholic set pieces. Whilst the director let the plot reveal and extrapolate slowly, he cleverly managed to include a beautifully taken song \"Bismil\" which manages to lift up enthusiasm in the audience as the song was a clever narration of what's been happening in Haider's life. Choreography in the song along with Shahids mannerism was definitely a pleasant watch. Also, the song \"So Jao\" gave me chills, one more reason why I enjoyed watching the movie. Climax was almost guessable from the many hints about redemption that were floating throughout the movie. Controversies apart, this movie is hands down better than the contemporary commercial films with some strong acting, dark plot, mesmerizing locations, unforgettable locations and great music. If you don't like watching gloominess on screen or can not tolerate slow screenplay , this movie is not worth watching for you.",

            "content": "HAIDER: This is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's most acclaimed play HAMLET, using the backdrop of militant insurgency in Kashmir in the mid 90s. Shaihid Kapoor plays Haider (PRINCE HAMLET) who returns home after his father (Dr.Hilal;KING HAMLET)got arrested for harbouring militants. He eventually finds out that his father has been illegally executed by an unholy nexus between Indian Intelligence (represented by DCP Pervez Lone: POLONIUS) and his own uncle Khurram (KING CLAUDIUS). He gets incensed realizing his mother Gazala (QUEEN GERTRUDE) has had inclinations towards Khurram. Neither his mother's undying love, nor the embrace of Arshi (OPHELIA) could dissuade Haider from seeking revenge for his father's death with the help of Ruhzada (GHOST of Hamlet's father), a suspected ISI agent. Masterful in his approach and execution, director Vishal Bharadwaj seems to be an entirely different beast when it comes to reinventing Shakespeare in modern Indian context. Bit slow in narration, but truly magnificent in describing the plight of ordinary Kashmiris as Indian Army, Pakistani ISI and power hungry politicians slug it out in what was once \"Paradise on Earth\". Tabu is spine chillingly accurate in her role of morally grey Gazala,blamed for infidelity and who fails to hold on to her son whom she loves more than life. K K Menon, Irfaan as Ruhzada and Asish Vidyarthi as Indian Brigadier impressive as always. But Shahid Kapoor has elevated his acting skills to dizzy levels in his portrayal of the tragic prince, spiralling into insanity in his pursuit of retribution for his father's murder.

            "content": "Vishal Bharadwaj (VB) does two things in this piece of cinema which can be argued to be his best; he adapts Bard's Hamlet in a visceral fashion and while doing so, lifts it up from the Denmark of 1600s and places it bang in the middle of the Kashmir crisis of 1995. And the surprising part is: it is not the Kashmir Bollywood loves, it is not the Kashmir through the eyes of a tourist. Depicting the gruesome side of the region and not falling prey to the temptation of what Mother Nature there has to offer is in itself an achievement worthy of applause. But Haider does that, much more, and how! It is faithful to the original text as much as possible. The departures, wherever present were essential, owing to the fact that it is being shifted spatially and temporally through huge distances. Characters of most were unchanged in their purpose and characterization. Some have been merged together and some split. The Gravedigger Scene, the Oedipal Undertone between Hamlet and Gertrude, the dilemma of Ophelia to choose between her Father and Lover, all done wonderfully and brought to justice! Without spilling beans, the character played by Irrfan Khan, called Roohdar, is a deviation from the original material, but what a masterstroke it is. Like this, there are other liberties which VB and Basharat Peer took while writing the script, and among them the climax will definitely stand out. Though the execution of it was like walking on a thin line occasionally leaning towards preachy, but then again it's a very personal opinion. Performances by Shahid as Haider/Hamlet, Kay Kay as Khurram/Claudius were definitely praise-worthy! But Tabu as Gertrude, steals the show with her maturity, restraint and spontaneity. Supporting cast of the Grave Diggers, the militants in the deceiving attire and appearance of simple minded old fellas was brilliant; as were the two Salmans, providing ample comic relief to this otherwise brooding tale set in a gloomy overcast Kashmir. Coming to the Political Statement the movie makes, this movie does take a stand. It might not be all-encompassing to show the whole scenario from a neutral POV, and it is not expected to be too. It's not a documentary, it's a feature film. It takes a young man (Haider) and tells his story. There indeed were 100s of Haiders which Kashmir saw due to the fate their families suffered. These things really happened. Maybe the projection of the Armed Forces was not entirely true, but this remains a fact that unlawful power yielding by a few did indeed bring shame to a whole ministry. In this aspect it is a very Political Film and no doubt there are hashtags in Twitter screaming #boycotthaider. You will have to face opposition when you refuse to bend! It is good to see a film like this get a mass release during Dussehra/Durga Puja in a country where director after director gets sold in the name of money to make formula driven crowd-pleasers. Haider might not be a very faithful adaptation of Hamlet and also as far retelling of the Kashmir Insurgency goes, POV of Kashmiri Pandits have been left out, but what was there was true, gut- wrenching, and hard-hitting. You have to give VB points for doing such a fine balancing act. This was something India needed. And in a broader generic sense, India do need films like this made in a more regular fashion.",

It was even true to a certain degree and would have lived up to all of its expectations, if it wouldn't have been 'Bollywoodised'.First off I would like to mention that Anurag Kashyap and Vishal Bhardwaj are probably the only intellectual directors in Bollywood. Many among the others are good but mostly inclined towards mainstream cinema.The film takes off well, Kashmir being the most apt background for the story. The dark underbelly of the city not only focuses the militants but also the inhuman acts of the army in the name of interrogation. In this turmoil, Haider's father was among the many thousands disappeared. Jhelum is the backdrop of his search where numerous bodies are found each day.After Haider is acknowledged what actually happened, he gears up for revenge. He thankfully is not the completely trained machismo who takes revenge with a single and efficient blow. He faces challenges, his mother being the most emotional one, and we realize that the movie is more than that. 'Bismil' was outstanding. The story takes its time and delivers in the end.While the movie is easily one of the best of the year, it certainly wasn't a masterpiece. I have no issue with its duration but some of it was unnecessary like Irrfan Khan's overrated entrance and the Shraddha Kapoor song. Salman brothers' story deserved better closure. Some of the dialogues were inaudible in the end! Many colleagues of mine termed it a dark movie but to me it wasn't dark enough (perhaps after the 'Omkara' fiasco when the critics panned the movie for its abusive language and the movie was a financial failure, Vishal might have cut down on too much dark material to agree to the UA cut instead of A).Performance wise this was Shahid's second best after Kaminey. Tabu was marvelous (as expected) as Haider's mother but this might be considered Kay Kay Menon's breakout movie. Shraddha Kapoor and others were also well cast.The best thing about it was its background, making it a beautifully painted paradoxical painting where everything seems beautiful and at peace, while only the ones truly involved are familiar with the truth that is never peaceful.Though becoming commercial is necessary, I liked him better when he wasn't, like with Omkara. You will certainly enjoy it more than me if you lower your expectations and this goes without being said, the movie is not everyone's cup of tea which is all about rushing towards the end.VB sir, you still rock!",

            "content": "Its always exciting when Vishal Bhardwaj or anyone attempts to make an adaptation of Shakespeare. Especially plays that are plotted around human shortcomings and the evil of our own brains. In this way, the two plays Othello and Hamlet are quite similar and are indisputably some of the best tragedies ever written. While in Omkara the protagonist is easily manipulated by the Iago like \"Landa Tyagi.\" Haider too is quite the prisoner of his own thoughts and is unable to overcome the loss of his father. These very flaws are subtly touched in Vishal Bhardwajs adaptations, while it is Shakespeare who makes these characters more believable to the masses. Othello was so overcome with his own insecurities that he never reasoned or confronted Desdemona, and ended up with both of them dead. Hamlet on the other hand is extremely negative and exhibits the thoughts of a depressed person throughout the play, who probably just needed more empathy and care from those around him. Haider, is a tortured soul, who takes everything at face value, and easily manipulated much like our boy Omakara and so both our heroes end up as slaves to their distorted impulses. However, in Haider the Kashmir aspect is sort of bigger than everything, but I feel that is only because I am Indian, and this takes away from my critique and I am glad that someone has at- least attempted to empathize with the beautiful people of Kashmir. Coming to the cast, this movie was all about Tabu for me. She is one beautiful women and one of best actresses of our times. I'm totally enchanted by her performance. Tabu is Kashmir herself, and symbolizes how beauty is a quite a curse. When people want to possess you, and for the wrong reasons, they do end up putting you in a cage and in a negative light for everyone else. Shahid has acted quite well, I did enjoy his portrayal of the madness of Hamlet, also to my surprise Sharadha, has managed to play her part well. I also like the more believable adaptation that of the character of Irfan khan in this movie. The Shakespearean fools and comic relief is also maintained with the characters of Salman and Salman, those guys made me laugh. Kay Kay Menon never disappoints. In-spite of some aspects being stretched more than required and Omkara still being his best adaptation, yet. I did leave the theater with the main monologue of this play in my head \" To be or not to be..\"",

            "content": "There is something daringly exceptional and unfathomably unsettling about the film Haider. Vishal Bhardwaj sure understands his Shakespeare; I must give him that. So much so as to anoint an underrated actor to play one of the most daring and complex roles in both written, as well as film literature. What Bhardwaj never seems to miss, for me, is context. His context is weaved in a thorough understanding of the time and place of a situation. Except, for the inconsistency of the use of Kashmiri accent in this film. And of course, the Salman Khan anachronisms. Salman had not found his machismo up until the mid 2000s. His Dabangg type depiction was out of order. To point that is to niggle! But, of course.But Haider's craft is in its cinematography. We are not in for the plush Kashmir. We are in to see the boils on the snow, encrusted by bombs; the color code of white and black alongside the gushing shades of red. You can almost feel the gush of blood and gore towards the climax. Contrarily, there is this scene in the garden, where Shahid takes a walk with Tabu, which I feel is a cinematic masterpiece. Think of a selfie in that frame and you are sure to get a dazzling shot; except that Haider reminisces the grim too. The beauty alongside the grim! It is also not all gory. If you have an eye, you can see Kashmir in Shraddha's eyes, Tabu's fingerwaves, pots of kehwa put out on snow, the redness of the scarf woven by Shraddha.I was almost aware of the storyline before I hit the theatre. I was constantly looking for tones of Oedipus, as apprised by the critics. There were undertones. But I don't understand why I felt the obverse! A few scenes percolate down your psyche. But one musn't forget that this is just one side of the story. With that in mind, the scenes- where Peer (also the co-writer) peers through his house gate (read 'comes from a short-story by Kashmiri writer Akhtar Mohiuddin'), Shahid's reference to Anantag as Islamabad, the intermittent, yet consistent use of the word 'curfew'\u0085 (I wish I had my notepad handy).But my favorite is the scene at Laal chowk. Right after the point when Shahid finds out the truth about his father. Shahid does manage to pull off a great deal of his thespian skills. But he remains an actor, not a character. What haunts disturbingly in the scene is fragments of truth in Shahid's words- the unfailing want of Kashmiris for azadi- from Hindustan, from Pakistan. I must mention here that Vishal Bhardwaj never ceases his connect with History. It kept resonating in 7 Khoon Maaf in the background through the narrative on All India Radio; in bits and pieces here by talking about AFSPA, the 1989 incident, Nehru's promise of a Plebiscite, the exodus of Kashmiri pundits, etc. But this is a movie. A bollywood movie. It never disappoints with aphorisms in war type/depiction of violence. It ends with an adage by mother to her son \u2013 that peace begets peace, rage must be quelled to give way to inner peace. Not entirely incorrect though!Shahid tries his best. What possibly works is his below average performances in the past. With little expectations, he shines! But he is always an actor. Does not get into the grain of the character. That is that. He is watchable. Shradha can be given amiss. Tabu is seasoned. Irfan, Kay Kay Menon are veterans. Actors extraordinaire.Haider is not for the lighthearted, impatient caucus. It requires an understanding of Vishal's cinema. It is a journey, sometimes arduous. One must travel through Shahid's melancholia, up hill and down dale of a story- each frame is important, each frame forming the story. It's a sure watch from me, call it my personal Vishal Bias- I try not to miss any of his movies. I saw Matroo with the same zeal as Haider! Please do not download. It requires a cinematic, theatric experience!",

            "content": "Deciphering the complexities of Hamlet is indeed an onerous task and it is due to the underlying conflicts and the familial dynamics that Hamlet, along with King Lear, is considered amongst the toughest works of literature that the Bard has bequeathed upon us. Not that I had an apprehension about Vishal Bhardwaj settling for something that is duck-soup but talk about \"pushing the envelope\" and Vishal has \"ripped it wide open\" by choosing the bloodstained backdrop of an insurgency-hit Kashmir for the last installment of his Shakespearean trilogy. What \"Chutzpah\"!!! Vishal Bhardwaj, the true blue \"Bard of Bollywood\", adapts the pith of his source and astutely tweaks bits of it to blur the lines between fact and fiction. What transpires is the plight of the valley where, as pointed out by the script writer Basharat Peer, self-identity is a matter of dispute. In an absolutely gob-smacking scene that depicts the status quo of Jammu and Kashmir, Basharat plays a local resident who stands stiff at an entrance with his mother oblivious to the fact that he dare not enter without being frisked. This scene, alone, is worth the ticket price of Haider. As much as one can extol its ballsy content, Haider is also bejeweled with gilt-edged performances. Kay Kay Menon, essaying the role of Claudius from the play, registers a nonpareil portrayal. His Khurram is both power greedy as well as lust laden yet he is more opportunistic than sadistic. His shenanigans are born more out of circumstance and less out of willingness. The striking feature about Kay Kay's act is that he doesn't overplay Khurram's connivance and his Kashmiri accent is spot on. Shraddha Kapoor's Arshia is an amalgamation of Ophelia and Horatio from the play and not only does she look the part but also shimmers in her career best performance. Her presence lends tranquility to this unsettling revenge drama. Her naivet\u00e9 is innocuous and her dialect is inch-perfect. Never did a fleeting appearance leave such a hammer strong impact as Irrfan's Roohdaar does. He might not have a meaty role but every time he shows up on screen, the film's gear shifts into overdrive. Roohdaar represents the soul of Hamlet's father, one that appeared as a ghost in the play. He brings an agonizing end to the volley of questions jostling Haider from within. Even with a handful of scenes to prove his worth, Irrfan is a thunder-stealer. Reckoned to be the pivotal character, Tabu's Ghazala is far more layered than Hamlet's Gertrude. She has a laconic personality and her eyes do most of the talking. Her existence is \"caught between two stools\", one being half-widow and the other being half-bride. Tabu, the enchantress that she is, doesn't even need to pull out all stops to display the intricacies of Ghazala. She casts a spell with her smirk and nails her part with panache. In the most convoluted titular role, Shahid Kapoor plays(read \"becomes\") Haider with such stamp of authority as if it's his prerogative. Think of any emotion in the book and Shahid gets the better of it on screen. Apart from an odd outburst or two, he is scintilla-tingly understated in the first half. However, it is only post intermission when Vishal unleashes the beast in him. Without taking anything away from the rest of the cast, the second half is a \"Shahid Spectacle\". Watch out for those revenge thirsty eyes flickering with intensity as he dances his way to gory in BISMIL or the lunatic monologue where he brazenly addresses a mob or the self-indulgent soliloquy where he speaks his heart out to himself. Respected members of the jury, give away all the best actor awards pronto. Narendra Jha, who's blessed with a pleasant baritone, is mighty impressive as Shahid's father. Every other actor's presence, including veterans like Ashish Vidhyarti and Khulbushan Kharbanda, is noteworthy. Haider narrates a tale that most would turn a blind eye to where as the others would raise their eyebrows in abomination. Either ways, it's a predicament that almost every director would shy away from. Not so when the director's name is Vishal Bhardwaj. With Haider, Vishal has outdone himself even by his monumental standards. His self-assurance as a film-maker stems from the subtle manner in which he handles the oedipal connotations between Shahid and Tabu. Alongwith his co-writer Basharat Peer, Vishal presents Kashmir from a humanitarian's point of view. Respect. The usage of the word \"Chutzpah\" as a euphemism for its similar sounding Indian slang and the dialogues are worth eulogizing. Beauty being deep-rooted in its milieu, Pankaj Kumar's cinematography brings out the pathos of the paradise like no other Bollywood movie ever has. From the very first hearing, I have maintained that Haider's music has a shelf life as long as eternity and the songs come alive on screen. \"Bismil\" blends storytelling into choreography and is a visual delight. \"Aao Na\", sung by the grave diggers, glorifies death and is haunting to say the least. \"Khul Kabhi\" is every poet's gratification and \"Jhelum\" leaves an indelible aftertaste. Gulzar Saab deserves a special mention for weaving his magic through words. The background music unerringly complements the melancholic tone of the movie. The editing lets the story define its own pace and once the content takes over, even blinking is not recommended. The climax fits so well in the scheme of things that its departure from the original seems like a blessing in disguise.FINAL WORD: Haider is a torchbearer for nonconformist cinema that shouldn't just be shelved as a masterpiece. It also merits to be the subject matter for a lesson or two in film-making.Somewhere up there, William Shakespeare, \"The Bard of Avon\" as he is famously called, must also be in awe of the sheer genius that went into the adaptation of his literary work.",

I rarely watch Bollywood movies,and much rarely appreciate them because I hold them in the same standards as the Western Movies i revere unlike many Bollywood movie watchers who have their usual lines ready :\"Arre bollywood se kya chahta he aur tu ???\" For such guys:\"I want a godamn Haider !!!\" And kudos to you Shahid Kapoor !!! For the first half he basically had only one expression on his face( he kinda reminded me of Keanu Reeves ) but in the second half he has one of the most expressive acting I have ever seen in recent Bollywood memory. Sadly Irfan Khan is in minor role only. Of course no surprise from Tabbu whose acting was pretty good as usual. Great directorial work by Vishal Bharadwaj and writing by Basharat Peer. To all those patriotic Bhakts who feel hurt by the movie's portrayal of the Indian Army : It is the truth they have portrayed and they haven't politicized it at all (frankly highly minor) . It has treated the problem of Kashmir as our own country's problem and not some problem in a foreign land. The fact that our countrymen there once lived in the fear of getting disappeared in one of Army's 'interrogation camps' is the sad and shameful truth, and the movie also appreciates the normalcy in the valley and the efforts by army in the flood efforts, so no more drama please !!!",

Haider depicts hamlet in the foreground of tragedy called Kashmir , there is blood everywhere on snow capped mountains and even on Dal lake side. It shows moral corruption , conspiracy and rage which haider endures till the very end. This movie shows mother-son relationship in a completely different way , it confuses you as in what exactly haider or ghazala wants. In the end when ghazala is ready to detonate herself we see both uncle and shahid running towards ghazala , it makes you believe that both are ready to lay down their lives for ghazala but they both end up loosing every thing they had. Full marks to VB for making such a tragic and disturbing drama ,thin line between hell and heaven has been completely captured by story writers. This has to be the greatest role that shahid would every play while tabu has shown her class again. Mein rahoon ya na rahoon badla loon ya nai loon jaan duu ya jaan loonReverberating lines !!",

Layers of tragedy makes it so dark for the mass - the film dramatizes the most neutral perspective (which is bloody brutal) of Kashmir massacre till date adding to the heartbreaking darkness of Hamlet. Shraddha had an extremely difficult time keeping at par with the brilliant cast of Haider. While Menon is superb as always, Shahid doesn't waste the chance to demonstrate his gift. How he emerges from a wounded young man to beast filled with wrath is just perfection. However, with all these performances, the film can't be considered a masterpiece had Tabu not played Ghazala - Haiders mother. She defines this film, she is the film. It's mesmerizing to see Kashmir all over, especially because its snowing most of the time. Dialogues are complex and powerful at the same time - there are few you will remember for a long time. Some might consider it a slow movie but I felt the dots are so interestingly connected that there is hardly a moment to feel lost. I didn't find the music to be great except Bismil Bismil because of its larger than life dramatizing. A story of disaster, mistrust and revenge - magically told by Vishal Bhardwaj.",

Its a must watch because it shows how talented Indian Actors are and creativity by Vishal Bhardwaj throughout the movie along with THAT amazing song which gives you goosebumps and also explains the plot of this film.Now the main point about some people asking for this movie to be banned and the actors to be jailed for being Against Indian Army - No i am not getting paid for saying this. Neither am i against Indian Army or India as a whole. I love my country and i respect the Indian Army for providing us the luxury of living our lives in peace most of the time.(Obviously apart from when some of the politician try and make a mess of such a beautiful country like India)Yes this movie does depict Indian Army being at fault during the 90's. Do i get offended by that? Not really. Why? Because i believe that whatever information we receive from our newspapers or news channels or articles in magazines or even our country leaders can be wrong. That information might be misleading us. I am not telling you to not believe anything but to always keep a window open in your head that this information might just be wrong.It is possible the Indian Army made a mistake then during the 90's. They are doing an amazing job right now and i respect them no matter what. Thats because out of 100 people there only 2- 3 might be doing the wrong thing. Thats the case everywhere. It can be in your locality or the place where you work.A person who see's so much in a place like Srinagar is capable of reacting strongly against people who might be terrorists. We should accept the fact that its possible that the Indian Army might have faultered then but at the same time should be proud that they have made efforts to change the situation there and now there is peace completely due to them. Our parents can make mistakes so why can't the Indian Army. Don't be so negative towards the brilliants work done by the artists. Don't say things like ban this or jail them because you're just going to create a mess in this country. We have enough people here to make this country unstable,we definitely don't want more.",

            "content": "In one line, Haiders' a relief from typical Bollywood craps. Some will like it and some will not. Whatsoever .. you still need guts to make film like Haider. Visha Bhardwaj .. you are the saviour. This kashmir was never seen before. Though screen play was quite a letdown, and Shahid, though not a let down, but left a wide scope for improvement as far as character is concerned, Haider is still a good one time decent watch. People might say it is Shahid Kapoor's best till now but still would prefer to rate Kaminay over any of his other films.Kashmir looked completely different this time. There were snow, but covered with red fog of blood and betrayal. There were beautiful kashmiri people but scared and exploited. The feel good factor was completely missing this time and trust me that's for good. It's beauty is as intense as the pain. Considering it is the last of Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Shakespeare tragedy trilogy, he indeed tried to give his honest effort by roping in, what I would call, few of the last breed of great actors till new one arises. Tabu, Kay Kay, and Irrfan Khan \u0085 each name is enough to expect something big and worth to film making when brought together with likes of Vishal Bhardwaj and Gulzar.Though an adaptation, and depicted as revenge drama filled with obvious hatred, Vishal Bhardwaj has used revenge as backdrop instead. He is more focused on the growing pain and increasing hatred than the final standoff. Tabu as half widow mother has delivered more than what could have been expected by her. She is such an amazing actor that her mere presence create moments to remember after you leave theater. Irrfan Khan with a very brief part as \"Rooh\" made his mark beautifully. His entry alone justified our expectation of him. And not to mention Kay Kay as \"Aasteen Kaan Saamp\". Well I loved the way he become the character every time I watch him in any of his movie. I loved him in Shourya which was total in contrast of what he is in Haider. He is like a chameleon. Shahid as the protagonist is strictly OK except in few scenes where he displayed his skills beautifully like when he returned from his father's grave for the first time and gave a street performance which explained the irony of sandwiched kashmiries in general and his character in specific both at the same time. It is not that he has not delivered but may be it is just that he was not apt for the role. Shraddha Kapoor got kashmiri looks and started off decently but her character was not developed properly as observed. Or may be she was just not meant to be in focus.Though it is normal to find flaws and being critical for work in your interest areas but it is good if you are being so towards work from someone whom you expect to deliver intelligently every time. And Vishal Bhardwaj is one of them. There was a time when filmmaking (in India) was categorized as Art and Commercial cinema. But guess slowly Art cinema is now a grown up and has a new name. We call it \"Intelligent Cinema\". And people like Vishal Bhardwaj are among the authors who made it possible. Now we have \"Intelligent\" and \"Commercial\" cinema instead. Years back when film making was in process of development (early 60s), people made movies. Just movies. But once reached a specific level and considered a great medium of entertainment and revenue, people bifurcated it into Art/Serious/Real and Commercial/Fiction based on reality. While Art cinema was fighting to gain a decent viewer ship, commercial cinema kept demoting itself and kept making craps but magically or say obviously still remained as acceptable as it was before. It was with Satya in late 90s that embarked a new phase and slowly a new breed of director emerged towards whom a section of audience are really thankful to. Ironically or intentionally, not sure, but there are two characters in Haider who are Salman Khan's fan. Both addressed as \"Salmans\" and both were killed brutally by Haider during the climax. For me that very scene is the expression of frustration of \"Intelligent Cinema\" towards \"Crappy Commercials\".",

The characters, the plot, the visuals and even the last few songs drag the viewer deeper into the ethos of the misery while the original story of Hamlet that I always admired pales in comparison. Those who are familiar with the director's work must be praying Mr. Bharadwaj continues to remake more of Shakespeare's work interpreted in his own unique story telling style which poignantly brings to light the very real ground situations in India while leaving the viewer to make his/her own judgement.Brilliant performances by Shahid Kapoor, Tabu, KK Menon and the late Irrfan Khan (who is sorely missed). This is the power of such story telling and direction that the real actors in Bollywood gravitate to do the bidding of such a scholarly director who also writes parts of the screenplay the lyrics and produces these films for the glory of art rather than any commercial interest.I actually feel bad for those who don't understand Hindi or Urdu to understand the native dialect and consume the story as is. While raw in its portrayal of Kashmir it is probably one of the most refined pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Now before you go about learning a new language to enjoy this film, there are subtitles that will still render the movie well worth your time if you enjoy critically acclaimed cinema delivered not just with passion but with a purpose!P.S. the film is long as the story is built in the first half you may think the beautiful visuals of Kashmir are in itself enough to watch the film, but hold on to your seats for the thrilling end that reveals a deeper message on freedom.",

            "content": "HAIDER - Moving , haunting and heart wrenching saga. A thought provoking goldmine.To be or not to be. The question is - Is Vishal Bhardwaj India's Best? The answer lies in Haider.Haider is a box of surprises,you never know what you are going to get in next scene.Haider keeps your brain occupied not only while you are watching it but even after you are done watching this gem.Haider is simply magic.From portraying the literature Hamlet in Kashmir so beautifully yet depressing to the complexity of human relations.From showing us the shocking ugly,violent & disturbing past to depicting the pain & misery of troubled souls in Kashmir.From showing the beauty of death to the fact that death actually is in lives.Welcome to the Haider's world - A world where is Revenge but Pain as well.Where is Love in eyes but hate in those eyes too. Where is Conflict but Blood and gore too.Where is sanity & serenity but lies insanity & Most Importantly - a World of Chutzpah !!PERFORMANCES - are top notch. Tabu as Ghazala is so exceptional that anything other than nomination in Best Actress category would be injustice to the brilliance she portrayed on screen.The character Ghazala is most probably the most heartbreaking character ever written.Tabu shines like diamond in this film.My heart goes for her.She was born to play Gertude.After her ,Haider belongs to Shahid Kapoor.Its his career best performance.From a vulnerable young man to a man lost in complexity and then finally losing sanity.He portrays each phase of his character with Sheer brilliance & perfection.Watch out for his scene in climax with his mother.That single scene is alone enough to prove that he is the best actor of his generation. There are uncountable scenes in which Shahid stands out as spectacular actor - scenes visiting his burnt house, breaking down in his mother's arms convincing her(himself actually) that his father is not dead,Talking with his mother on phone with equal amount of hatred and love for her ,the scene with his dead lover in his arms, his angst in bismil sequence(brilliantly danced too), the Chutzpah scene for he justifying went bald & the stunning climax scene. Each scene out of these belongs to him.Portraying this multi- complex character of Hamlet is not an easy task.It is the most difficult character ever but he gave this character his all.Haider was in his eyes & his soul.He actually lived Haider while playing it and became the character himself.Only actor of his generation who can stand strong with the legends around him - unaffected & confident. Kay Kay Menon is the best choice for the Claudius.Colorful in one scene & as devilish as he can get in the another scene.The switch between his attitude towards Ghazala & Haider is outstanding. Shraddha Kapoor is surprisingly good.Her beauty and innocence compliments the character of Ophelia.The wool trap scene & her scene with tabu literally shakes you.She is serene & brilliant in these 2 scenes.They say it right that Vishal Bhardwaj brings out the best of actor .Irrfan Khan is a rockstar in his cameo.He plays roohdar and actually puts new thrill & more life in the film once he comes.His entry is one of the remarkable entries ever - leaving whole theater go berserk.A short but very important role which comes as a turning point in the film.The man playing Haider's father is simply outstanding.Talking about the climax,The climax is undoubtedly the best climax I've ever seen of any bollywood film.Its haunting.Its heart pounding & it shakes your soul. Shahid Kapoor said in an interview : 'For the shoot, I was Haider. And now, Haider is me' . I'd say the same after experiencing Haider that 'Haider is me'.This pretty much explains the impact of the film.CINEMATOGRAPHY - Stunning! MUSIC & BGM - MesmerisingDIRECTION - Who would have set Hamlet in Kashmir so poetically & yet perfectly.Vishal Bhardwaj is genius.His vision is so clear that the film never flinches.From the use of poetry in the film to the way of adapting Hamlet is just out of the world.The way he kept the film subtle yet exciting.This film is his bravest & boldest film.A film bound to make his place in cinematic history. It amazes me how he never stumbles - so many complexities yet so clear & strong film.The film never goes direction less which was the biggest risk in this type of film.His direction is simply flawless.I agree with Hansal Mehta(an another brilliant filmmaker) who said - \"In the coming time,people will adapt Vishal Bhardwaj.\" I am still amazed how everything was so perfect in the film.One of the rarest film which shows something you have never seen before. Some amusing scenes proves that how Vishal Bhardwaj is king of dark humor - the gravediggers saying dig your own grace and sleep , the man who is unable to enter the house without being questioned , one scene in which a kid suddenly stands out of dead bodies realizing that he is alive and then celebrating his life while Haider was searching for his father's dead body in that pile. These scenes are so brilliant,new,amusing & yet delight to watch. The literature Vishal Bhardwaj bought in the film is commendable.Hail Vishal.VERDICT - A rarity, a film that is soulful,thoughtful,poetic & preserves the depth while being engrossing,involving,intelligent,witty & technically brilliant. It's a tearjerker, sometimes, and soul stirring at other moments. It's more than perfect.In your void time you often would think about scenes of the film & wont get it out of your mind.It get stuck in your head,heart & soul.As one of the actors of this 'literature on screen' said : \"People will rave about haider even 4-5 years down the line\".I would say he was wrong - People will remember Haider FOREVER.RATING - 5/5. Vishal Bhardwaj's best for me.",

            "content": "Haider - The Film Vishal Bharadwaj who is known to adapt William Shakespeare's work and then recreate its characters and circumstances in Indian arena has hit the Bull's Eye once again. First thing first , after watching the movie .. I can proudly admit that my faith in Shahid Kapoor's acting ability has restored and \u202a#\u200eVishalBharadwaj\u202c is an equally good music composer as he's a director or dialogue writer (Mind it, this is a rare combination). \u202a#\u200eHaider\u202c is not particularly about Kashmir or \u202a#\u200eAFSPA\u202c . It's actually a narration about the personal experience of a guy who gets trapped in the mud of revenge and emotions. However the director quite skillfully keeps the scenario of the situation of Kashmir & roles of Indian Army, Separatist Leaders and Militants. Performance wise \u202a#\u200eShahid\u202c has completely nailed it with his expressions. Credit should be given to the casting director as well becoz apart from Shahid, Tabbu and Kay Kay Menon were also flawless, \u202a#\u200eIrrfanKhan\u202c in his cameo is pleasant. Shraddha Kapoor has still less to offer but she was impressive for the first time (At least for me). Gulzar Saab's lyrics and Vishal Bharadwaj's music... this combination has always been admired, making this time no exception. I would give this flick a 3.5/5 from my side. Why to watch : If you really are looking forward to a good movie and for Shahid's 'best so far' act. Why to avoid : There are 19 shows of Bang Bang - The Movie as compared to 7 shows of #Haider in the same multiplex. And yes, Haider lacks that \"Entertainment Factor\".",

Music of this movie again gave audience an opportunity to listen Fiaz Ahmad Faiz and obviously \"Jhelum\" will going to stay in our subconscious forever. Overall Haider is an important movie, for the audience of India and Pakistan. We are passing the phase where the political power holders are giving threat to each other, Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi share the Nobel Peace Prize 2014 for the issues of India-Pakistan children rights and we got Haider. So it has total impact on the situation and the movie gave us a chance to rethink about the situation we are living in and try it to make it better.",

This movie was captivating from start to end. I was not able to think about anything else in this world. Stunning work by all of the team members. I congratulate them for such a good job. Well Done! But, I found many things missing from the movie. I will focus on 2 of them here. Firstly, Shraddha Kapoor failed to do justice with her role. This time she was unable to appear on same level of brilliance as other actors did. She has a lot to learn. Music, average music. Music contributed nothing to the movie. It could have attracted more people to cinema screens if music was good. It is an awesome movie and I loved watching it but it is not the best movie of 2014. Right now I can think about \"Ek Villain\" as the best movie of 2014. Let me know if any other movie fits for the title. Thanks",

I see the best adaptation of the Shakespearean drama, but finally the story crossed the limitation of taking idea from a masterpiece. To tell you the truth, Haider became another masterpiece of World Cinema, in relation with its political, historical and visual beauty of Kashmir. The land was not handed over to its own people as commitment by India and Pakistan at the time of partition of 1947. The Urdu Writer Sadat Hossen Manto always blamed Pandit Jawhorlal Neheru for being keen diplomatic about Kashmir. As they both from Kashmir (Manto and Neheru, Manto used to think, Panditji betrayed with Kashmir.We see, in the shadow of play 'Hamlet', a story of near past has pictured in Haider. Along with other beauty and actions from the play, I must remember a Scene, that is very unique in the film \" When a mother tells to Roohdar ( Irfan Khan) about his son, returned from the army camp, but he is not entering to his house by strange nature. Rooh then comes to him, asks (in soldier's voice) him about his ID and Prison detail, orders him to go to home. The boy moved like soulless body.

The movie is class drama with an awesome direction and not to mention the the obvious, screenplay and Tabu at her best justifying Ghazala character as a mom.

While on the other hand, he also loses trust of his lover. The desire of revenge changes into a big mistake of Haider's life.

But in this movie in few scenes and specially in one of the songs at second half , Shahid is proved me wrong. Overall this movie is a typical Bollywood movie. The movie is slow and at times it drags nowhere and you feel bore. the acting from Tabu, Irfan Khan and Kay Kay Menon is as expected from them. There is nothing new from their acting and they act in the same best style as they have been doing. Shradha kapoor character has just gone waste but she looked and acted wonderful.

Tabu also gives a fabulous performance with real and heart wrenching emotional scenes. Shahid and Tabu both give the Oedipus complex a new light with the undercurrents of sexual tones. But on the other hand Shahid has a absolute beautiful and innocent relationship with Shraddha's character, Arshia, she truly has given her all and has performed spectacularly. Kay Kay also has an important role, and completely submits to Claudius' snide and snake like demeanor. Irrfan Khan has a short but powerful cameo that leaves an imprinted impression in your mind.",

There is a big difference between people who make movies for money, and people who make movies to make an impact. This was definitely the latter.

A multitude of themes emerge in a higgledy piggledy fashion throughout the movie, rather than focusing viewer's mind on a single, strong idea. Few themes could have been easily avoided - for example the exasperating romance of Shahid and Shraddha, and cheesy references to Salman Khan movies.

And Tabu is just, WOW. so beautiful and talented. *The way in which music effortlessly syncs into the pace of the movie, keeps you hooked throughout. The intertwining of Kashmir, the interpretation of Hamlet's father's ghost in the form of 'Ruhdaar', the chemistry between Haider and his mother is outstanding. My favorite moments of the film are the times when Tabu threatens to kill herself, Something so morbidly poetic about how that eventually ends up. The story depiction of what happened to Haider's father performed so convincingly by Shahid (song: Bismil) left me with goosebumps. But without doubt, what won my vote was the absurd song-performance in the graveyard, where the idea of death and burial is trivialized into a celebratory moment.

However Shraddha Kapoor did not achieved to create emotions altogether.She spoke fluent English at the border check post when Shahid kapoor was in trouble in the opening scene.Later on she fumbled to spell Loved as love-ed and sucked as suck-ed... How come!! She was just rendering dialogues and does not blend properly with the character. Tabu did a fantastic job! She was a spice in the movie.. The movie wont have been done without Shahid Kapoor. Spellbound after seeing his acting.. Altogether its a superb movie..",

            "content": "Her enchanting eyes rivet you right from the beginning \u2013 those deep, brown eyes that drown secrets and sorrow with aplomb. Haider is the untold story of the \"disappeared\". Those fathers, husbands, brothers and sons who are arrested by the armed forces in Kashmir and taken away, never to be found again; a few thousands who are methodically erased from their everyday lives.Ghazala Meer tells her son Haider \"we are called half-widows here\u0085\". They wait eternally, initially with hope that their husbands will return; then with indifference that they at least locate their dead bodies. Poignant scenes of a wife's praying silently for her husband to return, a son's search for his lost father haunt us throughout the story.Haider's search takes him through some dark secrets of his family and sets him off on his internal journey of self discovery \u2013 from a college kid to a mature man to an insane \"madman\"; his metamorphosis forms the main storyline of the film.But what towers over all this is Ghazala's character. She is a demure wife, teaching in a school and the proud mother of their only son \u2013 Haider. She has accepted her dispassionate life in exchange for a decent living with all creature comforts. All she wants is what any other wife asks for \u2013 a loving husband who provides, a safe environment for her family and a cozy, comfortable home that she can call her own. When she starts feeling these are about to be compromised, a deep fear engulfs her and she panics. She begs him to stay away from danger; but her deepest fears come true as she sees her house bombed and her husband taken away, branded a criminal.Left to fend for herself with nowhere else to go, she is faced with a difficult choice \u2013 to fight alone for her husband's return or to accept the worst and take refuge in her brother-in- law's house. She chooses the latter, knowing well that he secretly harbors a desire to marry her. This is made clear by his frequent flirting, his refusal to marry anyone else and his shameless ogling. When confronted by her son on her questionable intentions, she hides away her shame behind her anger and justifies her actions.Although a helpless half-widow, she is fully aware of her charm and uses it to her benefit; just as she had exercised emotional blackmail with her son in his childhood, as he recollects. Torn between the love for her son and her future hope of becoming Khurram's bride, she years for the utopia of a perfect life in the blood strewn icy slopes of the valley. Like a lioness who has lost her mate to a younger, more aggressive male, she stands by her new partner, fully aware of the fact that the new male will eventually kill her offspring.Haider's girlfriend and constant companion in his pursuits, Arshia is a young journalist. Their deep love for each other and their innocence is beautifully portrayed. This is in sharp contrast to Khurram's lustful pursuit of Ghazala and their adulterous relationship. Kay Kay Menon's convincing portrayal of Khurram marks yet another of his illustrious performances. He proves yet again what a fine actor he is. He is just Khurram during the film; there is no Kay Kay Menon. He can be seen as a \"villain\", but then again, you will forgive him for just being human. Tabu as Ghazala personifies grace and beauty. Alternating effortlessly between a helpless mother and a cold, distant mistress, she forms the strong strand that sews the film together.The film does justice to the place it has chosen as the backdrop \u2013 the Kashmir valley is shown in its pristine form in peak winter, resplendent with snow flakes, frosty lakes and vast expanses of white. The cinematography befits a large screen viewing. The scenes of blood on ice haunt you long after you have left the theater halls \u2013 an agonizing reminder of the conflict. However, the music is disappointing, considering it is a Vishal Bharadwaj movie, the expectations were a bit high.But where the director wins yet again is in exploiting and exposing human relationships; the layers of a person, the multiple facets of a human being. Supported by brilliant actors, it only falls short in its inability to build towards a better (and less clich\u00e9d) ending and the brilliant-effort-yet-not-there acting by its younger star cast which fails to evoke the necessary emotions towards the protagonist.",

            "review_title": "Great Adaptation....Awesome Performances .....Must Watch",
            "content": "As everyone know that \"Haider\" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's well known drama \"Hamlet\". For those who know the story of Hamlet there are very few changes in the story line,but there is a twist at the end...and i'm sure you will be stunned at the end. And for those who don't know the story of Hamlet,it doesn't matter...do just chill.The background of the film is set on the situation of the Kashmir in the mid 90's.But its actually not about the situation in Kashmir,it is a family revenge drama,so don't except to watch some indo-pak action in the movie,though the movie talks about the disappearance of the militants in the custody of Indian Army.In the first half hour of the movie it is hard t understand hat the movie is all about...(again this is for those who don't know\"Hamlet\").once you have got the idea of the movie,you just get into the flow of story and it is a combination of good written dialogues and \"Sher&Shayari\"Writing:-I must say both Basharat Khan & Vishal Bhardwaj has done good job converting Hamlet in Haider.Awesome dialogues they have given \"to be or not to be\" a new meaning with \"Hum Hai Ki Hum Nahi\".Direction:As always Vishal Bhardwaj is master for Shakespeare's adaptation,this is his third Shakespeare adaptation and he has done marvelous job with this one too.Performance:Shahid Kapoor:-Who is portraying Hamlet aka Haider in this movie. In the some parts of the first half he felt little confused within him self about the character,but in second half he just flew away,this is probably his best performance after KAMINEY.Tabu:-She plays mother of Haider.She has once again proved her self as a brilliant actor,she is very convincing in the roll of a loving woman who just want LOVE in her life. Tabu look convincing i her character. Kay kay Menon :-He tries to give his hundred percent for the character,though till end we kept filling that something is missing in his performance.overall he has done a good job.Irrfan Khan :-He is one of those actors who can easily portray any mysterious character. His roll may be short but he has done a tremendous impact on audience in that short time.Shradha Kapoor:-Shradha is playing Arshi,Haider's love interest with whom Haider can share any secret.She has done convincing job in as Arshi.Narendra Jha:-As the key character of the story he also gave his best as Hiader's father.Music:-As all Vishal Bhardwaj movies the music of this one is also given by him self.and he has done awesome job with this one too. My personal favorite is \"So jao..\" sung by three gave diggers in a \"Barfila Kabristan\".I just loved it.Overall I will give this movie 8/10. This my personal opinion,your's can differ from mine. ALSO THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW I HAVE EVER WRITTEN IN MY LIFE.LET ME KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT MY REVIEW.",

I went to watch the movie with mixed feelings,while I had seen the director Vishal Bhardwaj weave magic in Omkara(Othello) before but frankly a Hamlet in Kashmir?? What greeted us was a treat for the senses,watchers beware,the tears will flow freely and the movie will stay with you long long after the credits roll. Watch it for Tabus multi layered character,KK Menons good guy yet bad guy portrayal and Shahid Kapoors intense acting. Every character in the movie is a mixture of any many characters,somewhat like a mosaic. There are no good guys or bad guys here,just human beings, caught up in an intractable conflict,like characters of a horror movie, caught up in an unending nightmare. Indian Cinema has finally come of age,take heed ,Ladies and Gentlemen a rare masterpiece has been created. A Movie,a Canvas. something which will be savored again and again through multiple viewings.",

Life was not at all normal there,people in Kashmir are clueless of where they belong, may be this is why i am liking this movie more than anyone else as it is shown in the movie too. Shahid, tabu, imran, menon are pieces of gem. Every one should watch this movie for once. Vishal bharadwaj has done a marvellous job. Shahid and shradha has a great future ahead. All the songs were nice and melodious.I would recommend, If you want to make your weekend you should go for it. Kids may not like this movie,so there is Bang Bang for them on the other Screen, send them there.",
