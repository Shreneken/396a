            "content": "Step aside, Kevin Sorbo, we have a new man for the role of Hercules and his name is Kellan Lutz. If you have no idea who Mr Lutz is, check out his appearances in the Twilight instalments.Anyway back to The Legend of Hercules. As the title suggests, this is an origin story that sets up the demigod character. Despised by his father King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) since the day he was born, Hercules - the son of Zeus and Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) - is sent to war after failing to elope with his true love, Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss). King Amphitryon favors his elder son, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan); unfortunately he is not warrior material let alone lead a kingdom and winning the heart of Princess Hebe. As fate would have it, Hercules survived the war and returns to reclaim his love and kingdom from the wrath of King Amphitryon. The poster reads From the director of Cliffhanger and Die Hard 2 - it's unfortunate they forgot to add in the fact that both were movies from more than twenty years ago, and Renny Harlin's directing career has long been sunk by a certain Cutthroat Island. Let's face it; The Legend of Hercules isn't going to resurrect Harlin's status in Hollywood anytime soon. While similarly themed movies such as 300, Immortals and Clash of the Titans are known more for their visual aesthetics than storytelling, The Legend of Hercules failed miserably on both accounts. Filmed entirely in Eastern Europe because of cheaper costs and taxes, Harlin's movie mimics the feel and look of its predecessors while pretending to strip down to the grittiness of that era. However every single set piece looks like a cheap knock-off, right down to the CG extensions - case in point, one seriously fake looking puppeteer lion looks even worse than that in cable series Spartacus and Rome.Written by at least four credited writers (one of them from the terrible Conan the Barbarian remake and Harlin himself), it is such a shame that the supposedly mythology-inspired story instead resembles Ridley Scott's Gladiator more than anything - if you recall, Maximus, was also betrayed and sold to slavery but made a comeback for revenge. We didn't realize that the legendary Greek hero Hercules actually ventures on the same path until now.Unimaginative plotting aside, the movie suffers from incredible clunky, modernized dialogue peppered with a variety of British and American accents and awful delivery from the actors. With the exception of McKee and Adkins (surprisingly turning in a solid performance), most of the cast members - especially Lutz - needs to sign up for advanced acting classes. Minus off all the disemboweling, limb and head severing and bloodshed you normally would have expect from such a theme (an obvious attempt to lure in younger audiences), The Legend of Hercules quickly dissolves into a predictable yawn fest.It's a tad disappointing that a movie about a demigod with incredible strength fares without emotion and plays like generally a mere paint-by- number adventure. Comparing to the 1997 animated feature by Disney, this one is hardly worth the time.",

            "review_title": "Shocked at how a film this bad made it to theatres/cinemas",
            "content": "Not the worst of anything to do with the Hercules legend, there are a few obscure low budget animated adaptations (not feature length) that are marginally worse. When it comes to feature length films, it would be very difficult to think of a worse depiction of Hercules than 'The Legend of Hercules'.The sole saving grace is Liam McIntyre. He is the only actor who tries and the only one to feel right for his character and within the tone of the story. However the rest of the acting was just diabolical. Kellan Lutz has to be one of the most charisma-free and can't-act-his-way-out-a-paper-bag actors working today, he brings none of the heroism and conflict of this great charismatic hero and spends all his screen time looking blank and wooden and uttering his admittedly terrible lines with the flattest and most awkward line delivery imaginable.Can't say anything better about the ladies either, who also show their acting limitations, especially the portrayal of Hebe who is in dire need of an acting coach. The obligatory villain acting is so pantomimic and overdone that one's surprised at how there was any scenery left from all the chewing, and it is so cartoonish that it veers on at times unintentionally comical rather than menacing.Blame cannot be entirely laid at their door though. 'The Legend of Hercules' is very incompetently directed by a director that in the film's worst parts even makes Uwe Ball look good. Even worse is the script, which is extremely flabby and heavy in banality and melodrama. The characters are genre stereotypes basically and have the development of a thin piece of cardboard. The story, what there is of it (for the running time this is often wafer-thin and threadbare storytelling) rushes from one scene and plot point to another, and jumps around constantly that following what's going on is not always easy. But because the writing and characterisation has so little to them and that thrills, emotional engagement and such are next to none the film feels interminably dull and lifeless often.Some bad fantasy-action-adventure films have the credit of looking good. That cannot be said at all for 'The Legend of Hercules' that looks like direct to video fodder from SyFy or The Asylum. The photography is unfocused and editing choppy, with an irritating over-reliance of slow motion and impregnated pauses that come over often as gimmicky, excessive and unnecessary. The sets and costumes look recycled, and to say that the special effects are dodgy is not just an understatement but actually pretty insulting, some of the worst effects of any film seen in recent years.What little there is of the action is at best uninspired choreographically, an eyesore visually and in terms of peril they're somewhat tame. The music score is lifeless and forgettable, very generic genre scoring actually. The 50s and 60s Hercules films may have been cheap and cheesy, but at least they knew what their goals were, who they were aiming at and what tone to take. 'The Legend of Hercules' fails at all three of those things, often it was difficult to work out what it was trying to be or what tone it was aiming for as it tries to be light-hearted fun and also take it seriously and fails abysmally at both.To summarise, very bad film. How it made it to theatres/cinemas and not straight to DVD is honestly a complete enigma to me, and this is coming from a very subjective person when expressing opinions. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying I am a huge fantasy fan. I can usually enjoy any swords and sorcery type film and find something good about it. Now let me say Wow this movie was bad. I mean I thought this kind of clumsy, lowest common denominator filmmaking died in the 80's. It is bad when I asked the organizer to give me a refund on a free prescreening.Where to begin? I don't expect much in this type of movie in terms of plot or characterization. In action \"porn\" like this, the plot is usually just barely coherent enough to move from one action sequence to the next and the characters are as black and white as a chessboard. This movie somehow delivers LESS than that.It is staggering to me that with a mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time.What really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. WTF? It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. Oddly enough, the blood and gore in this film is kept to a minimum, probably to keep it at PG-13 in hopes of duping the largest possible audience to drop money on it. It would have really benefited from a Conan-esque level of violence to give the movie more weight and better directed action sequences. The dramatic pause in the middle of the action (made famous in the movie 300) is in every single action sequence. I really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it. It will make a profit and encourage more of the same I'm sure.",

And I gotta say, after seeing this movie, I'm really looking forward to the Brett Ratner version, and that's saying something. Where do I begin? The acting is hilariously awful (Kellan Lutz and the villains especially). The romance is laughable. The fight scenes are a total rip off of 300 and Gladiator, with obnoxious slow-mo being used every 10 seconds. And for a movie with a budget of $70 million, it looks cheap.The Legend of Hercules has some of the worst production values I've ever seen in a film. The costumes look noticeably cheap, The props are low rent, The green screen effects are amateurish. The 3D conversion is even worse. And the CGI looks worse than an Asylum movie.Final Verdict: Unless you're watching for a cheap laugh, you should avoid this stinker like the plague.",

            "review_title": "An Early Contender For Worst Movie Of The Year!",
            "content": "The Legend of Hercules is a film directed by Renny Harlin, and stars Kellan Lutz, Scott Adkins and Gaia Weiss, and revolves around the character of Hercules, son of Zeus, who was born solely to end the life of the King of his people, and unite the lands in peace, or something like that. I didn't pay too much attention, to be honest! This movie is horrible. It's clich\u00e9d to pieces, poorly directed, horribly acted and disastrously written. All the dialogue feels so god damned forced, and makes it incredibly difficult to latch onto any of the characters. Whenever they speak... It's like someone saw Spartacus or Game of Thrones and went \"Well, now I certainly know how people of that era spoke!\" and wrote a screenplay, full of fancy words and shallow speeches. You don't feel like a single word here is sincere; from Hercules speaking to his clich\u00e9d, forbidden love Hebe (Yeah, that's right; his forbidden love's name is Princess Hebe), and from the King to his son... It's all atrocious! The screenwriter also saw the speeches in Braveheart and LOTR: Return of The King and went \"Well, we obviously need a battle speech!\" and wrote a bunch of big speeches that were emotionless, and couldn't have been more forced. I'll move on, cause I could go on about the dialogue for days! The acting... It's too much! The main actor, Kellan Lutz, came from Twilight... So you knew from the beginning you were in for a bad ride. He's completely emotionless, stale and you not for one second care for his character. His forbidden love, played by Gaia Weiss, is equally horrible! The only reason she was cast, obviously, is because she's pretty damned hot! Scott Adkins, though, leads the way in crappy performances! His entire performance revolves around him yelling every single word. He could be speaking to his wife in private, and still find the need to yell every word to her. It was dreadful to watch! The only decent performance was delivered by Liam McIntyre, who plays Hercules's friend and comrade. He could actually deliver the lines with a bit of power, emotion! Despite his decent performance though, the rest of the cast deserves Razzie's. I'm calling it people; every single actor and actress here will get nominated at the Golden Raspberries this year! That is not good!The action is horrendous. Remember 300; that badass film about Spartan's kicking a bunch of Persian's asses? And remember how it used to go into awesome slow motion every once in a while during the fighting, when a sword was plunged deep into a body, or someone hit another over the head? Well, they do it here! And is it good? Hell no! They overuse it to pieces, and by the end of the film, you can't help but cringe every time it occurs. The action in general feels weak. There is never a moment in this film in which you worry for Hercules. You always know that he's going to beat his opponents, and that makes for fights that have you bored and uninterested! When the great hero Hercules lacks peril in his fight scenes, you have a problem. The CGI here is again, horrible! All the green screen looks like it could have fit right into a 1980's action flick. For a film coming out in 2014, that's not a good sign! All the CGI aspects of this film look incredibly fake, and mixed in with the terrible live sets, it makes for a difficult experience. I'm so thankful I did not see this in 3D, I certainly wouldn't have been able to stand it all. And the extra admission price... completely criminal!Overall, The Legend of Hercules is a pile of crap. Just please don't watch this! This film should be nominated for Razzie's, and make a minimal amount at the box office. It's one of the worst movies of all time, and certainly going to be on my top 10 worst of 2014. I need to watch 300 now, to feel good about this genre again. 1.1/10Find more film reviews at www.entjunkie.blogspot.com",

Kellan Lutz is bad as Hercules (Hopefully Dwayne Johnson will do better in the next Hercules movie). Every line is said horribly. Did i mention the dialogue is BAD.The script is horrible. It has nothing to do with the original mythology. It tries to be like 300 and Gladiator but fails horribly. The romance is so cheesy with the worst romance dialogue i have ever heard.Are the action scenes good?....No....Far from good. It always uses slow motion just like 300 (which was used better) but it was obnoxious and gets old and annoying. The visual effects and green screen is horrible and this movie has a budget of over 70 million dollars!!! What?! Movies with lower budgets look more convincing then this. Overall rating 1/10 One of the worst movies i have seen all year and we're still in January!!! Hopefully the Brett Ratner version is better and obviously it will be. You can't get lower than this.",

            "content": "This movie lost me even before I was dragged into the theater. The trailers made it look like a movie made mostly for the sake of violence and for showcasing the sweaty, hairless, shirtless bodies of the male actors; there is plenty if the latter, but shockingly less than expected of the former so if you're interested in bloody and graphic violence skip it, there's nothing that graphic to speak of. The story of Hercules's impossible tasks, is abandoned (and only makes a cameo in a scene where he kills a lion) and instead it's been replaced with a meathead's view of Ridley Scott's, Gladiator. The story and characters are as shallow as kiddie pools, the editing never slows down the pace which is tiring after the first twenty minutes, the same establishing shots are used in the very first shot of every scene, the music also doesn't know how to tone down, as that the climax of each scene is accompanied with large, \"rousing\" crescendo, the writing is awful and gives you no look into the mind of the characters (at least I hope they had more going on in their heads than what was expressed), there is no acting to speak of, and the visual effects look like they're from a Sci-Fi Channel movie.

It got worse. If you are just looking for an entertaining film, this is a major disappointment, to say the least. Obvious special effects, slow motion for every other move in every fight scene, and terrible, I mean tragic, dialog. If you are a fan of Greek mythology, it's downright offensive.

Kellan Lutz can't carry a movie on his own, then again, no one could've carried this movie.From the opening dialogue \"I accept your challenge, prepare to die!\" you know you've got a long movie ahead of you. Oh and the fight scenes...not sure if they were trying to be \"The Matrix\" or \"300\" with all of the slow motion it used, but it didn't work. The fight scenes would've been better had it been shown full speed.Then there's the love triangle and the 3 actors involved were all equally terrible. In one scene after Hercules returns and the girl sees him for the first time after she thought he was dead, they lay in the woods and it's just awkward.The CGI may be the worst of the 21st Century. It's like they didn't even try to make it look real. It felt like one of those SciFy B horror movies you watch...I take it back, it was worse than that. And at a running time of only about 90 or so minutes, it felt like 3 hours and the fight scenes were the only bearable part of this movie. But even those get repetitive with all of the slow motion like I mentioned before.I can only hope that the next Hercules movie being released later this year will be better, and I'm not too worried that it will easily surpass this horrendous piece of work.

A low-budget PG-13 adaptation of 300-style movies made in Bulgaria, this movie is in line with the expectations on what Renny Harlin is capable of.While not being a disaster on a whole, it's a disaster in parts. The special effects, while being descent 3D images at times, are badly connected with live shots. There are many moments when perspective of such sequences is distorted in really obvious (and unintentionally funny) ways. There are numerous anachronisms. Characters use costumes and jewelry that could not be available in ancient Greece. Screenplay, while not being completely absurd, has some rather awkward dialog lines and unexplainable plot moments.Unfortunately, the movie is not a Hercules legend but rather a shallow love story and family drama. There's even a bathing scene in a romantic- looking pond with flowers under a waterfall (the water in the pond is so dirty though that one can only feel pity for the actors). There are no heroic deeds of Hercules depicted in this movie.One last blow for Hercules is PG-13 rating. There's no blood at all. When swords pierce bodies, they re-appear absolutely clean. When one of the characters was struck in the neck, the next shot showed his neck without a sign of a would or even a drop of blood. One of the few things the movie managed to deliver were some dynamic battle sequences; but PG- 13 made them look fake. In the age of 300 and Spartacus TV show, this is not something you want to waste your time on.Unless you wish to add to a surprising $8 mln box office success after its first weekend, which will probably make this movie more profitable than most other current releases.",

The actual purpose of this movie is to impact the global industry, to make producers realize that, no, bad movies actually DON'T WORK, and they are not easy money.A simple, honest, gladiator movie with no fake big name like Hercules, with no fake romance, with just a guy fighting and living in the roman empire would have made more money.

Directed by Renny Harlin, the movie couldn't even figure out, what to call its title, as it was formerly known as Hercules: The Legend Begins and Hercules 3D. Don't bother, reading up on the myths of Heracles, as this movie redirected you to a new story, where the evil King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) has just invaded the land of Argos. Feeling in shame of war, Amphitryon's wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKenna) ask Hera to get Zeus to rape her so that she would have a God-child that would over-thrown the evil King. First off, Hera whom supposed to be the Goddess of virtue women and marriage allow this to happen? Hera was known for her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus's lovers and offspring. How on Mount Olympia did she allow this to happen? Anyways, after Zeus had his way with the Queen, a child was born and grew up to become Hercules (Kellan Lutz). Oops, my bad, He-Man. No, that isn't right, I meant Alcides. Kellan Lutz is so one-dimensional dull that it was painful to see him in this role. The man doesn't look like a damn like the Heracles in mythology. Where is the Nemean lion coat? They really misused that lion. Why is it, smiling? Anyways, Alcides is having a great life being in love with his incest sister, Hebe (Gaia Weiss) who somehow lose her God-like powers of youth. When she's force to marry, Alcides's brother, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan), with Alcidies's disagreement. Amphitryon is forced to sell Alcidies into slavery as a gladiator. Now, Alcides must find a way back to his homeland, and defeat this evil father. Yes, the movie is not only ripping off the slow motion unrealistic fighting styles clich\u00e9s from 2006's 300, but also the whole plot of 2000's Gladiator. The movie doesn't even seem to know the difference between the Romans and the Greeks. There is little prove of that there were Gladiator type fights for entertainment in Ancient Greece. The 3D work is pretty bad. There were scenes, where my eyes hurt after watching it. One good example is the lake scene where little white dandelion pieces were flowing everywhere. The action scenes were alright, but I just can't take a movie that has a silly scene with Hercules waving a lightning bolt bullwhip, seriously. It felt so formula, like it was model after the God of Wars video games. The CGI background were pretty horrible. You can tell in some scenes that it was filmed in green screen. The movie has little to no sense of time. The queen and the king don't really aged in the film. They look like they haven't aged in the last 22 years. The production seem limited, it really did look like they re-used extras and props from Star's Network TV Series Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The movie lacks with the PG-13 rated as Hercules was always meant to be a pretty hardcore violence film. Overall: For all the modern Sword and Sandals films, it's probably one of the movies, I wouldn't check out, until last. It's one of those movies, you really can't stand seriously. It's so bad, it's might be good, depending on what you deem as fun. For me, the Legend of Hercules is a punishment straight from Hades. For a movie about Hercules; I have to say, there are other films that might be better than this. Go see 2014's Hercules with Dwayne Johnson. If not go find Kevin Sorbo's Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995\u20131999) television show. Even Disney 1997's Hercules that had little to do with the main story was better than this. Still, this movie is a lot better than 1959's Hercules Unchained, 1983's Hercules and others. Why can't Hollywood ever take a story that works and make it compelling without dumbing it down, getting it mostly wrong and totally missing the point? I'm still waiting for a good Hercules movie. In my opinion, this movie wasn't the one, I was looking for.",

Fortunately for Rene Harlin, he can't be accused of pilfering everything, for in this version Hercules/He-man kills Thundercat, also known as the Nemean lion, right at the beginning of the movie, which is a shame, because as a result he has to go everywhere by foot, or use a horse.

Instead of concentrating on his special strength and the tasks, it turned into a Spartacus like fighting movie. At least it wasn't sickening violence - just too much fighting. The love triangle with the brother feels forced. So is the liberation of Argos. Hercules isn't supposed to lead some army to free a city. I understand if they didn't want to just rehash all the mythology stories but this ill fitting incongruous story is bad.The female romantic lead wasn't pretty enough for the role. That made it feel B grade. Kellan himself can't act as well as Chris Hemsworth but he's okay for the role in terms of looking the part - it's not Shakespeare after all. His big speech at the end is awkward. Acting shouldn't be the thing in this type of movie but they could have done with a few bigger names in supporting roles to add some weight.If you lower your expectations a lot and don't think of the mythology at all to you might have a slightly diverting time watching an action movie set in ancient times. The grand CGI backdrops are moderately watchable. At least it doesn't pretend to be a great movie - so it wasn't as annoying as Wrath of the Titans with it's even more idiotic story.",

THE LEGEND OF HERCULES is one of three similarly-themed films that came out around the same time; one is a B-movie with Sean Astin and the other a Hollywood blockbuster with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The other two will need to be pretty bad to equal the poor quality of this one.THE LEGEND OF HERCULES feels and looks like a cheap cash-in copy of 300 for the most part. Scott Adkins, who plays the stock villain in the film, is even dressed up to look like King Leonidas in his early scenes. The hero is played by Kellan Lutz, who played in support in THE EXPENDABLES 3 but has no discernible talent for his leading role here. In fact, he's dreadful. He may have a huge, Schwarzenegger-style physique, but he makes Schwarzenegger's acting style look like Laurence Olivier's by comparison.It doesn't help that the below-par script was written by Sean Hood among others; Hood similarly fumbled the recent CONAN THE BARBARIAN remake, although that was better than this. There's little story and instead plenty of CGI-enhanced action including war scenes and fights with dodgy-looking lions. Some of the fight scenes aren't too bad, but they're overly stylised and feature silly scenes of characters doing superhuman jumps through the air and messing around instead of finishing off their opponents quickly.All that was left for me to do was to sit back and count the appearances by actors from no less than four TV shows. Gaia Weiss, from VIKINGS, is the love interest, and Roxanne McKee (GAME OF THRONES) plays Hercules's mum, although of course she's far too young for the part. Kenneth Cranham (ROME) shows up as a slave trader. Best of all is Liam McIntyre (SPARTACUS) playing Hercules's friend and ally. I was amused to see that McIntyre is given an ugly fringe haircut so that he doesn't distract from Lutz's appearance. Anyone who has watched and enjoyed SPARTACUS will know McIntyre would have been far better in the lead role.",

A lot of the story takes place in gladiatorial games, except that those were Roman, not Greek. I thought that was common knowledge? Anyway, the CGI in this film is simply terrible, especially with the lion. It's really easy to notice that this was made in 3D. Everything so awkwardly tries to jump out at the audience.It's a pain to watch this on TV. While not as bad as \"Jaws 3D\" it's still rather noteworthy. I thought that was Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, but I knew he's too good of an actor for something this terrible. I guess there's a few good lines in there and that's it. Where in the legends does it say that Hercules wields an electrocuting whip? It's just so stupid. Having seen \"Troy\", I thought this would at least be a long epic story, but I'm certainly glad it wasn't!

Later in life, the boy takes on the name Hercules. But other than these nominal details, it seems the rest of this \"origins\" movie was not derived from the ancient myths at all. Case in point, mythology tell us how angry the goddess Hera was with Hercules because he was a product of Zeus' infidelity, even driving Hercules mad to kill his own children. However in this film, we get an Annunciation-like scenario where Hera appears to Alcmene and tells her that Zeus will visit the queen to plant his divine seed in her. It was even Hera who gave Alcmene the name Hercules.The lady love of Hercules in this film, the Princess Hebe from Crete and her entire story line with the love triangle with Hercules' half-brother Iphicles, is an original conception by the four scriptwriters, of which director Renny Harlin was one of them. Watching \"The Legend of Hercules\" is like watching a compendium of all the sword-and-sandal films I have seen. The most dominant elements were from \"300\". This film in fact looked like a sequel of \"300\" because of the similar style of computer graphics used for the sweeping scenery, the crowds, the fights. We also pick up similarities with \"Troy\" especially with regards to the battle scenes. The jumping attack move made classic by Brad Pitt's Achilles was multiplied so many times over in frequency and variation. We will also get reminded of deadly accurate archery skills of Orlando Bloom's Prince Paris.About halfway into the film, we will remember \"Ben Hur\" as Hercules becomes a slave and was made to row an ocean-going sailing vessel in rough waters. Then it becomes \"Spartacus\" as Hercules becomes an arena fighter for people's entertainment and gambling.Later on, we will be reminded of \"Samson and Delilah\" when Hercules was being whipped while chained to two pillars. At that moment there will be a scene of mocking and divine communication reminiscent of the crucifixion scene from any film about Jesus like \"The Passion of the Christ\".It was rather disappointing that we do not get to see familiar Hercules stories such as the \"12 Labors\", except from a short scene where he slew an ugly CG animal they called the Nemean Lion. Anyhow, having a B-list cast with only Kellan Lutz of \"Twilight\" fame as the most familiar name as the titular hero, I guess we really should not expect too much from \"The Legend of Hercules.\"",

For all the flak that \"The Legend of Hercules\" has received since it's release, the movie is actually more than enjoyable and keeps us entertained right through its 90-minute run-time. Admitted, the story might take some liberties and depart a tad from the source material, but these cinematic licenses aren't that glaring that they can't be overlooked, especially in the hands of a competent filmmaker like Mr. Harlin, who knows how to carve out a fluid action blockbuster.Like most of Harlin's previous movies, he begins by concentrating on unfolding a simple plot, which later transcends into one thrilling action sequence after another. He presents his characters in an uncomplicated linear manner, ideally suited from an action film of this nature. The script deals with the origin story of the the mythical Greek hero. Betrayed by his stepfather, the King (Adkins), and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love, Hercules must use his formidable powers of which he knows nothing of, to fight his way back and regain his honor, pride, love, and fulfil his destiny. The combined performances from Keelan Lutz, Gaia Weiss, Scott Adkins, Liam Garrigan, Liam McIntyre, and Roxanne McKee are decent enough to blend with the proceeding on hand. As expected, the cinematography and visual effects are top-notch. However, the editing does feel to abruptly jump between a few scenes and could have done with a bit more finesse.With a coherent plot, fluent characterizations, and astute direction from the ever-reliable, Renny Harlin, \"The Legend Of Hercules\" serves up a concise adrenaline-pumping action bonanza, befitting the tale of a celebrated folk-hero such as Hercules.",

Newt would be near to dying at the hands of a scrupulous villain and the funny Centaur Newt would let out that screech of his in that irritating voice \"Herc, come quick, come quick, there's danger ahead\" I had not thought about this version of Hercules until I watched the 2014 version of The Legend of Hercules. What they have in common is that irritating and repetitive music that when danger is near you know you will hear that repeated sound which is intended to represent fear versus the hero Hercules. After more than 50 years on the shelf The Legend of Hercules was able to get back under my skin.When I think about the late Steve Reeves whose many stints as the mighty Hercules back in the last 1950's I actually enjoyed these versions of the Hercules films. Now spring forward 55 years later and I am truly disappointed that with the producers spending 70 million dollars on The Legend of Hercules that it reminded me of how irritating the 1960's Hercules cartoons were. Why you may ask I felt this way is because there is no redeeming features in this version just an endless stream of putrid CGI fights between Hercules and his many adversaries.In this version of Hercules, Kellan Lutz was suckered in to playing the lead role. Well Kellan, it doesn't matter how much they paid you to take this role on, but in my opinion you would have been better off falling on your own sword within the first five minutes of your first fight scene, rather than appear in the endless stream of poorly designed CGI fight scenes that certainly would not interest any age group be it the 8-13, 14-19, 20-29, or over age 30. You can also forget appealing to an all male or all female audience. This film was just the pits.I gave it a flattering 2 out of 10 simply because any producer who wishes to spend 70 million dollars on this crap should get some credit for keeping a lot of people in the film industry employed so that they can learn a few hard lessons from the many things that went wrong with the story telling and visual effects with The Legend Of Hercules.",

            "content": "Are audiences really so invested in the story of Hercules that they needed two big-budget action films in the year 2014 to showcase just how amazing and incredible of a person he was? Do audiences really care about the mythology surrounding his persona, and when I say \"audiences,\" I mean enough of the population, genuinely invested in his story, venturing out to the theater in big enough numbers to make a film based around him number one at the box office? Are people also so desperately intrigued by the mythology behind Xerxes and The Peloponnesian War that two 300 films were necessary? I ask these questions hellbent for answers because, the way I see it, people want to see the \"swords and sandals\" violence their impulses are screaming for, which is why Renny Harlin's The Legend of Hercules exists. This is a dull, dreary slog through the worst tendencies and oversimplifications of the genre, proving as redundant and mindless as the two 300 films but without even momentary entertainment, unlike those films. At least both of those films had a solid performance or two at their core.The film stars Kellan Lutz in an immediately bizarre casting choice. Lutz appeared as a minor character in every Twilight film, and somehow, that gave a producer the idea that Lutz had mustered up the charisma and potential to masquerade as one of the most famous, mythological Gods in history. I hope Lutz can eventually show his human characteristics because, when playing a God, he simply doesn't have the personality or complexity to make such a role work, but is also give dialog that can only be described as infantile to work with.Lutz plays the titular Greek hero, the son of Zeus, who exists as a half-man, half-God, bearing extraordinary strength. Left abandoned and helpless by his King of a stepfather and sold into slavery, Hercules tries to use his powers to fight back to his kingdom, engaging in plenty of battles and gladiator death matches in order to overthrow the King who cruelly mistreated and left him and bring peace to his fallen, divided land.Returning to the point of the film's dialog, it's amazing it took four writers to construct a screenplay almost entirely made up of loud, obnoxious screaming and monotonous fight sequences. Numerous battle scenes use the overutilized tactics of slow-motion, that have the only benefit of slowing down the film's action - even if for a few seconds - just so we can distinguish just what is happening before we return to being puzzled and disconnected all the more. Other than that, the tactic grows tiresome and only works to slow down an already slow movie. The dialog, when is actually considered and put to use, is nothing more than simple sentences structured to hopefully provide the film with some depth, when in reality, it feels like it's using pre-assembled lines from the unwritten book of \"swords and sandals\" clich\u00e9s that has all the situational drama already in the sentence and all one needs to do is write in the characters' names.The saving grace here from all the redundant activity is the teal cinematography, done nicely by Sam McCurdy, who works to create a consistent hue to the film that adds at least a competent visual scheme to the otherwise indifferent everything by Harlin.

Firstly, Hercules is a myth, a fiction; he is not a historical figure, so questions of accuracy in the events are not of importance. Secondly, Kellan Lutz doesn't have the stunning good looks, alluring tuft of hair and the power beard of Steve Reeves or Reg Park or even Lou Ferrigno, so are we stereotyping Hercules here ? Thirdly, there are complaints of cheap CGI - I didn't find evidence of that except in one sequence near the end where Hercules breaks pillars he was chained to and wields the broken pieces of masonry which seem made of thermocol. Kellan Lutz doesn't continuously display Flashy superhuman strength of Hercules or a muscular physique unnecessarily - in fact both these attributes are superbly understated and implied in the movie. Some of the fight sequences reminded some of Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' - so should the fights have been like Chinese martial arts ? Are we sure there would then be nobody crying out: boy, the fight sequences are lifted straight off a Hong Kong import! . . . Guys, come on, let's give Lutz's Herc a chance !",

You will not believe how stupid this all looks, it will blow your mind. The movie has no plot what so ever but it kind of feels like this we see Hercules with another name which you won't remember or care for, his brother takes credit for killing the lion that Hercules kills is going to marry the princess but she doesn't want to marry him cause she loves Hercules, Hercules is presumed dead. But he does a gladiator type thing gets kidnapped and bands an army who will fight beside him to stop the king and his brother. There was another Hercules movie that came out after this one and while I don't like it and consider it to be kind of bad, I honestly think that was a better adaption of the legend of Hercules then this. All this film seems to be is some sort of Greek film with a famous character with one poor action scene after another that consist of slow mo when you know for a fact it isn't needed. Along with all the other horrendous movies that have come out this year it like the actors are sleep walking or are a loaf of bread. When I think of a movie that says the legend of(insert famous character) I'm always hoping it will be awesome but it never is.

Basically in Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) succumbs to lust for Zeus, king of the gods, she bears a son that is prophesied to overthrow tyranny and restore peace. The son, Hercules (Kellan Lutz), has grown up as a prince, with no knowledge of his true identity or his destiny, his only desire is the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete (Gaia Weiss), who has been promised to his older brother Prince Iphicles (Spartacus' Liam Garrigan). Hercules does learn of his greater purpose and must decide between fleeing with his true love, or fulfilling his destiny and becoming the true hero of his time, he chooses the latter and endures gladiatorial arena death matches and harrowing battles, but in the end he does defeat King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) and takes back his rightful kingdom. Also starring Liam McIntyre as Sotiris, Johnathon Schaech as Tarak, Rade \u008aerbed\u009eija as Chiron, Luke Newberry as Agamemnon and Kenneth Cranham as Lucius. Lutz may have the body for the leading role, but he is rather drab, and Garrigan and Adkins are okay as the villains, one of my beefs with this adaptation is that there is not enough mythological stuff, almost none of the Greek monsters and creatures we've come to expect, the special effects are fine and the fight scenes alright, it is mostly let down by predictable script, it verges on pantomime, and overall it is a boring action fantasy.

Go figure\u0085.No, THE LEGEND OF HERCULES is not a great movie; it is a diversion. Does it stick closely to the myth of Hercules? Who knows? A myth after all is a myth and we've swallowed a lot of versions of this story before (remember Steve Reeves, etc?). But now it is in competition with Marvel comic heroes and space odysseys and a lot of other mindless time wasters that make it to the big screen because of the return of 3D. They succeed for the trill of dodging the special effects that make you scream.Short summary form the PR: 'The origin story of the mythical Greek hero. Betrayed by his stepfather, the King, and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love, Hercules must use his formidable powers to fight his way back to his rightful kingdom. In Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.' Make a lot of dramatic sense? No, not really.The main attraction of the film is the quite often barely clothed vision of megahunk Kellan Lutz as Hercules. His acting is up to the minor standards of the script, but it is his body that the audience pays to see. Toss in Liam McIntyre (television's second Spartacus), Johnathon Schaech, pretty Gaia Weiss, Rade Serbedzija, Scott Adkins \u2013 all television favorites \u2013 and the cast carries off this rather ponderous plot rather well. The CGI effects and the arrested and slow motion photography add to the circus and there you have the reason for making the movie \u2013 to see a lot of Kellan Lutz and a lot of blood and gore that seems to be the diet of preference for moviegoers.

In here, about each time they pronounced his name, they underline the fact that it meant \"Heracles, grace of Hera\" but called him by his Roman name anyway. It added a superfluous layer of fake of the movie, IMO.Moving on; The title is ironic anyway because the legend of Heracles gets severely mangled here: Oh, we've got the Nemean lion, but no mention of the snakes send after his crib, or the twelve labours, or any other chapter in the life of this godly hero plagued with many too human traits. No, what we've got here is a likable farm hand boy and a run-of-the-mill love triangle story so mundane that elaborating about it would be useless. He shows little strength of either will or muscle, being easily overpowered about half a dozen times in the movie.The whole movie is sanitized to the point that there is no blood nor flesh nor any of these nasty things that takes place in the world we live in. To make this gruel more appealing, it was filmed \u00e0 la Gladiator (from which it also takes its basic script) and 300, for the battle sequences and general photography (complete with an abuse of Matrix-like stop motion, for *every* move). There is action and romance all of the time, and yet indifference ensues. There's a fine line between cleanliness and insipidity.The actors, rushed and lacking direction, vary from acceptable (Kenneth Cranham) to mediocre (pretty much everybody else). The sets, stunts and fights do look good, but lack originality. The soundtrack is, well, unnoticeable.Short version: 3/10. Pretty much because I am outraged that Heracles, the basis for what we know today as the \"super-heroes\" culture, is being reduced here to a romantic teenage gladiator. On the other hand the movie is great if one has sleeping disorders - works every time for me.",

I meant Hercules, becomes a badass gladiator and gets his way back to his beloved. By the way, have I mentioned that he has no super strength at all?

At this point in the movie, you are waiting for those HD fights and some flesh (yummy).

            "content": "Its not uncommon, unfortunately, to see Greek mythology being run over and clobbered by cinema or TV, with its most famous stories being rebuilt or turned on things that are anything but Greek mythology. This film is just one more that does precisely that, using characters of the myth of Hercules to create a new story. So I'll start by object the title. This isn't \"The Legend of Hercules\", it's just a story where Hercules enters without us understanding why. Script is so basic and primary that it looks like one of those lousy, melodramatic novels, sold in supermarkets for a few coins. I would even say that screenplay is just an excuse for a ton of action and pure hard pounding which seems inspired by movies like \"300\" or \"Rambo\".Although I have managed to like or digest some of his films, Renny Harlin is far from being a truly skilled director. In this case, he totally lost his notion of ridicule, and this movie will probably haunt him to death. The cast is extraordinarily bad. Kellan Lutz is a lousy protagonist. It may have muscles, but it also has the same dramatic expressiveness as a Guinea Pig. He has no charisma, no presence and cannot express emotions, just strength. I've seen hosts of TV cooking shows with more dramatic skills than this actor, who should look for another profession. Good luck with that, Lutz! Gaia Weiss is attractive but she doesn't seem to know what she's doing there, and is never fully committed to the movie. Somebody give a map to this girl, she's lost and confused! Scott Adkins gave life to a cardboard villain, histrionic and pathetic, worthy of the worst possible death. Roxanne McKee is too young for the role she played. Liam McIntyre seems to be the best actor in this disastrous cast.Visually, the film abuses CGI and sound effects to increase the impact of scenes, especially fights and action. However, the quality of the final work is rather mediocre. Bad cinematography, blurred, with colors between gray and brown, doesn't help either. Combats are utterly unrealistic, some blows and jumps are absurd and that effect of pausing or slowing down the film for a few moments in the midst of a jump or blow is so clich\u00e9 that it gave me cravings for vomit. Costumes and sets are equally ashamed. The soundtrack is boring and ordinary.In short: this film is a caricature, a cartoon where characters from the Greek legend of Hercules were chewed, dismantled and thrown into a kind of idiotic video game, lifeless and without emotion, for an hour and a half of pointless fights.",

If not better because it felt like the pacing was done better in this movie with how much they tried to fit into the short time of the flick imho. It felt like we got to see a short piece of the early start for Hercules definitely not his entire story and the pacing at least felt OK for what was done in the time it was shown. The CG was decent and didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth of being over done like a lot of other shows based on similar mythology. The fight scenes did get a touch 300'ish but not nearly as overuse of the slow mo fighting as 300 does. All in all i don't think the super low ratings are warranted i think a fair 8/10 is what it should be at. The movie was a nice flick a little break of reality with fighting , mythology/lore , and some romance story mixed in. it definitely felt less rushed then clash of the titans etc and i liked the movie better then those over all.

I was well aware of the negative reviews before watching the movie, but now, after watching it I am compelled to write my own opinion as I cannot agree with the majority in here. Review: The movie develops beautifully. In the start of it, you are introduced to the characters and the universe of the movie. Not going to give any spoilers, so I will leave this at that level. I think now again about movies as Troy or the first 300. If I am to compare this movie to anything, i would describe it as a more artistic (good dialogue, nice and round story, good after the movie feeling); less battles and gore version of the first 300 movie. As the story unfolds, I find the battles much more interesting than in other movies and involving fistfights, sword battles, nice (awesome movie start) all out battles. The characters are developed more that usual for this kind of movies. I do agree that Kellan Lutz is not Collin Ferrel as far as historic speeches go as Hercules is trying to be portrayed as a demigod not a political figure. The accent here is on physicality. Other characters though, have clever lines and are well developed and presented to the viewer. There are 2 points in the movie, each one about 30 seconds (one minute in total) that seems ridiculous for the modern viewer but that are true to the Greek legend of Hercules. Overall, I find this movie much, much better than recent historical movies, a bit below Alexander. I will not say names on what movies is above, seems unfair to me, but I can provide you with the thing that I consider this the best ancient history movie since (?) the first 300. Go watch it, not always the majority of the reviews tell the whole story. You might like it, I did!",

The slow-mo action scenes and completely fake CGI backgrounds are nothing you haven't seen a dozen times in the last decade. Sometimes in better films, sometimes in worse. The acting is strictly amateur-hour with Kellan Lutz from the Twilight movies effectively ending any chance he ever had at being a successful leading man with his lack of screen presence and charm. His romantic scenes with Gaia Weiss will have everyone but little girls under 12 rolling their eyes. The lightning sword scene was supposed to be the movie's big \"wow\" moment but it gave me snicker fits due to its sheer ridiculousness. There's another stale scene that you've seen a version of in so many movies where a character has a knife held to their chest so they shove the knife through themselves to kill the person behind them. Well the knife in this case was about six inches long yet it was able to go through one person's shoulder and still penetrate the other person deep enough to kill them.

            "content": "The Legend of Hercules is meant for pure entertainment. Those who come looking for top quality from a film like this (like The Gladiator) will obviously be disappointed. I found myself enjoying the movie a lot because I had low expectations. For one, I was surprised by how visually stunning the movie was. The sets, locations, and gorgeous costumes were pure eye candy. The texture of the movie never looked \"soap opera-ish\" despite it not having a huge budget. Every drop of money is well spent on the beautiful set design and gorgeous visual affects. The cinematography is beautifully crafted to the point where if you pause at a random moment, it will be visually stunning no matter what. The editing is top notch; the movie is well paced and the action scenes flow flawlessly. And the score (background music) is the cherry on top to this action flick. There are some scenes here and there that look bad (mostly CGI stuff) and the slow-mo can be sometimes overwhelming, but it does not take away the spectacle of the film. I was rather impressed with Kellan Lutz's acting chops. In my opinion, he pulled the accent off quite well. There are some characters that are fully developed, and some that aren't. The character that stood out to me the most was Sotiris (played by Liam McIntyre.) Sotiris is not a fool; he knows when something doesn't feel right and expresses his logic to Hercules. McIntyre does a wonderful job at hitting all of his beats and steals every scene that he's in. The script also does a fine job at giving the characters enough time to express how they feel upon every situation. It helps us understand their characters and develop sympathy towards them. There is also a subtle hint of honesty in the dialogue between characters and it is rather refreshing to watch. Roxanne McKee as the Queen is sometimes a hit and miss for me. There are some scenes that she is strong in, and other scenes where I find myself rolling my eyes at her acting ability. And Gaia Weiss as Hercule's love is soooo bad. I don't think I found one scene that I liked watching her in. There is no denying the beauty of the cinematography, editing, and production design. The one huge flaw is the story itself. I can understand why some didn't like the film because of that but I don't understand the low rating of this movie. A 5/10 would be considered an \"OK\" movie, and this movie is more than OK. Honestly, I think people are too harsh on this movie and gave it a 1/10 carelessly and don't vote properly. People need to just sit back, relax, and enjoy this good action flick and take it as it is. UPDATE: Okay, the scene with (SPOILER) the lightning whip ruined the movie...so I moved my rating from 6/10 to 5/10.",

The story was plain straight simple and the art design of the film was goodThe 1 and maybe only complain I had with the film would have to be Hercules himself. Cullen Lutz portrays him well but he didn't really look like Hercules to me since he was not buff enough and too pretty boy looked for the character. Hercules in my opinion should have a bit of this brute looks within him. I think a man of lets say Brock Lesnar's size would have made a better HerculesAnother thing is that Hercules has the strength of the gods which makes him superhuman but in this film, I felt like I was watching Perseus more than Hercules since he didn't portray his godly strength up until the last minute and that was only of a minute of two. It would have been better if they showed him lifting up a pillar or throwing a huge rock at his enemiesOverall however apart from Hercule's character personality, everything else in the movie was OK for me",

            "content": "\"The Legend of Hercules\" has nothing to do with the legend of Hercules as we know it from Greek mythology.I remember that I went to the local library as a little boy and returned home with a enormous picture book about the 12 labors of Hercules.This picture book was so huge, when I was reading it, nobody could see me anymore.And in this picture book I read about Hercules slaying a lion of Nemea and the nine-headed serpent Hydra,catching a Erymanthian boar,cleaning the stables of Augeas by means of a river,retrieving the flesh-eating horses of Diomedes and abducting the hell hound Cerberus from the underworld.In those days these heroic feats appealed to me. And they still do.But you won't notice much of that in this Greek tragedy (in other words it's a sad affair).Ultimately it's just a pathetic hodgepodge of themes from various movies.A little bit of \"Pompeii\" which was also about a forbidden love between a princess and a slave who was forced to be a gladiator in Pompeii.The fight scenes were a weak duplicate of \"300: Rise of an Empire\" and \"300\".Especially because of the use of slow motion effects.A comparison with \"Gladiator\" is also easily made.And then the end is a lot like a children's matin\u00e9e on Saturday afternoon with cartoons of mythological superheroes such as \"He-Man\"which are shown on TV indefinitely.This movie is bland,uninspired and surely not legendary. The only impressive item in this movie was the chest of Kellan Lutz, who played Hercules. Perhaps it can impress teenage girls who marvel while looking at these muscular males.I was less impressed than looking at a crispy fried tiny chicken on my plate during lunch.In 1200 BC King Amphitryon invades the kingdom of Argos.It comes to a fight between him and his rival King Galenus.After defeating Galenus the kingdom Argos becomes part of Amphitryon his empire.He tells his wife Alcmene that this victory was for her.However,Alcmene is outraged by the thirst for power that her husband displays.That night she asks Hera,wife of Zeus,for help.Hera finally appears and predicts that she will give birth to Hercules,son of Zeus.Zeus (His father calls him Alcides) is born and after 20 years he has grown into a handsome muscular young man who is in love with the lovely Hebe.They hear the news that Hebe will be engaged to Iphicles,the older brother of Hercules.The two lovebirds try to flee.However,they are caught and Hercules is sent by his father on a expedition to Egypt,hoping he won't return alive.Ultimately it appears to be a trap and the regiment is being ambushed. Hercules and the faithful Sotiris are the only two who remain.They are sold as slaves to fight as gladiators.Hercules is doing everything now to return to Tires to stop his older brother and his beloved Hebe to get married.In terms of originality, this story won't win a price quickly. The SE's used aren't that impressive either. The fight with a lion in the beginning of the movie looks promising for a few seconds, but the animated lion has the same appearance as the computerized images of \"Jumanji\" in 1985. So, not really an improvement. The gladiator fights captivated me a bit. Yet it was a huge disappointment at the end. The fight that Hercules had to engage with 6 never defeated gladiators, was something I looked forward to. But it was just as if Zeus himself came along and interfered, because at that moment a storm came up here. And the first thunderbolt distracted me for a moment so I needed to rewind the whole thing because the great heroic fight was already over. And I just want to mention for those who can't endure blood : don't worry, because there is not even a single drop of it in this film. I think they ran out of fake blood after filming \"300: Rise of an Empire\".And then there were still a few things I had to chuckle about or that annoyed me. I think Amphitryon has some problems with his eyes or was blinded by anger. The night Zeus comes to visit Alcmene to conceive Hercules (which is associated with a considerable amount of wind. It reminded me of \"The Entity\"), he caught his wife in this supernatural act. And even though it is a large empty bedroom, where it's impossible to sneak out unseen, Amphitryon gives orders anyway to search for the unknown person. If you rely on the interpretation of Alcmene, this conception was quite an experience : \"Zeus came into my bed and blasted me with his seed to spawn a son to end your reign.\" The moment Hercules and Hebe meet back at the lake, I got a deja vu feeling about those flying fluffy things. It was also something that annoyed me during \"300: Rise of an Empire\". And the final battle with the lightning sword which smacked down hundreds of soldiers and the subsequent battle that Hercules fought with his father, was a bit exaggerated. It seemed like a Jean-Claude Vandamme scenario, where the hero first gets beaten up terribly before he claims victory.The performances are also fairly limited and meaningless. Kellan Lutz looks frightfully muscled and Scott Adkins is a rather sad looking king instead of a fearsome ruler. Maybe it's the overdose of sandals movies I saw lately, so I wasn't impressed with this \"Hercules\" remake. The only wow feeling I got was during the opening scene where the camera pops out of the water, swings over a battlefield with oncoming soldiers and then sways between the defending archers. A brilliant moment. But this level was not maintained throughout the film. The rest is an accumulation of stale and insipid situations. Hopefully \"Hercules\" with Dwayne Johnson, which comes out in the course of this year, will be far better.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",

            "content": "There has been a plethora of films to grace the screen since the inception of motion pictures. Many of which have been either great, horrible, or some place in between. I am someone who has been watching films for a very long time; for as long I can remember, in fact. I have been attending movie theaters since I was merely a toddler. And since I was a toddler, there have always been those movies that have enjoyed paying to see in the theater, or dreading the fact that I had just wasted hard-earned cash to view such an abominable piece of trash.When I heard that they had been developing a new Hercules movie under the direction by master Finnish filmmaker Renny Harlin, I knew this had been a golden opportunity that I could not afford to miss out on. Upon viewing the film that is 'The Legend of Hercules', I can boldly state that my precious seven dollars have not gone to waste. This film, this groundbreaking phenomenal piece of art, is what movie-going is entirely about. From the scale, the acting, the visuals, the action, the music, it is all simply nothing short of artwork projected on the big screen. When I arrived at my local movie theater on a not-too-busy Thursday afternoon, I second-guessed my initial objective to watch Hercules. I was aware that Peter Berg's magnum Opus, Lone Survivor, was presently an available alternative had I been committed to abandon the Kellan Lutz film. After a meticulous twenty seconds of debating which film to pay for, I (obviously) opted to stick with my original intention and was confident that The Legend of Hercules was my pick. After waiting behind some two obnoxious old bags, I confronted the cashier and announced that I had wished to view Renny Harlin's new film. I whipped out my leather wallet, pulled out a twenty-dollar-bill, handed it to the cashier, she then responded, \"Thirteen dollars will be your change.\" I then replied, \"Excellent.\" Then I grabbed my thirteen bucks in change, stuffed it in my wallet, and progressed to the front door. After I opened the front door, I swaggered on into the building. There the person who does the heavy duty occupation of ripping your valuable ticket, then telling you to either walk \"Right\", or \"Left\" to the particular theater where your movie is being played was. Upon then, I was theater-bound, until I felt an ominous sensation within my bladder \u2013 I had to take a whiz. So I journeyed to the men's room where I whipped out my sausage to deposit some of my lemonade into a toilet; thence it would enter the sewer line.I had been optimistic that I would no longer need to use the restroom for a good hour and a half. I walked into my theater, being somewhat embarrassed that I was all alone. Attending a movie alone can feel awkward if you are accustomed to having company in your presence, and knowing that at times large groups of annoying friends and/or families are commonly attending these beautiful events. So when I came around the corner of the seating area(s), it had come to magnificent surprise that I had been the first individual to make my way to see this new Hercules picture. I had arrived about ten minutes in advance, so I was sure I would not be the only one seeing this excellent film at 1:00 pm. About seven minutes later (give or take), finally a new viewer had entered the theater, an elderly gentleman who did not look the least bit excited to be there. So previews had eventually started, and I was clenching my fists in utter excitement just anticipating the reality that I was going to be viewing a new motion picture epic. I can not remember the order of the previews, but I swear that sometimes these trailers are just dragged out too long. And there are just way too many trailers to show these days! There are like five or six previews that had been shown, of course that may not be very many. To my recollection, I can recall I time back in 2003 or 2004, when I had to sit through some twenty previews! To be quite frank, the reason these previews felt like an eternity, was because I had felt a recurring sensation strike my bladder \u2013 I had to whiz once more! It was only last year when I went to see a boring stinker film called Riddick that I had to take the biggest whiz anyone could imagine. If you have ever owned an old house-trained dog, that you kept inside all day, and close to midnight you finally let it outside just to go release some of its inner lemonade, you would know what I mean. When Riddick finally came to a much-awaited conclusion, I sprang out of my seat, ran down the stairs to the men's room, then I released what I must confidently consider to be a waterfall. But I digress.In short, this is a very fun movie. You will likely enjoy it if you are a fun person. If you do not enjoy it, then you are not a fun person. You are pretty lame, as a matter of fact. Sure there are pretty mediocre moments, ones in which you might catch yourself laughing hysterically at, but movies like these are meant to be enjoyed that way. Go and have a see for yourself, because although this is being hated on right now, it will be viewed as a cult classic in years to come. When watching The Legend of Hercules, you will smile, you will laugh, you will cry. You may even do all three at once.",

Their task was to select a mythical hero (Kellan Lutz) and develop a movie around him. They did, they selected the son of Zues a true myth. However, since the story has been set in stone from the ancient stories. Historians have documented all of this hero's' exploits and now modern directors must try and make it relevant for modern audiences and interesting enough to satisfy their craving for action. Thus, their need for Literary license. For this, they took the original story and tried their best not to lose the audience with changes. Indeed, one cannot do that and please everyone, but the greatest numbers in the audience. Hercules was born to a mortal woman and who's father was Zues, kings of the Gods. Thus as a half man, half god he must endure the trials which include, the possibility of death. Indeed he is able to fall in love and develop hatred for his brother who is ambitious and wants to be the next King. King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) and his son Sotiris (Liam McIntyre) plot to have Hercules sent on a fool's errand where hopefully he will be killed or imprisoned. Rade Serbedzija who plays Chiron his teacher, tries to warn him but fails. As a result, the hero is enslaved and forced into an Egyptian arena. By the time he is aware, the hero returns to learn that his love Hebe (Gaia Weiss) is to be married to his brother. From start to finish this movie is action oriented and adventure minded. Depicted Military scenes follow the type found in '300' and 'Gladiator' and the audience is wowed by their outcome. Thus Artistic Linence is granted for the myth follows to a inspiring climax and I for one accept it. Great Movie follows and I predict it will be a Classic. ****",

But Amphitryon sends him away and arranges to have him killed, leaving the path clear for his wicked older half-brother Iphicles to marry his love Princess Hebe.This film, badged as American, but stuffed full of Australian voices for many of the principals and Bulgarian names throughout the credits (and locations), flirts mildly with the actual legend of Hercules before deciding to abandon myth and go straight for a remake of Gladiator, executed in a cross between the styles of 300 and the Spartacus TV series, only with no blood or decapitations (loads of sudden slo-mo, though. Simply loads of it).Kellan Lutz does a creditable job of looking like a third Hemsworth brother, all oiled pecs and stubble. I recognised Liam McIntire (Spartacus), otherwise the only familiar face was Kenneth Cranham as Oliver Reed. Sorry, I mean the same part which Oliver Reed played in Gladiator. The two blokes playing baddies gnash their evil but flawless teeth impressively (and necessarily, given the amount of scenery they chew), and the women are uniformly hopeless. The Yugoslavian actor playing mentor Chiron is incomprehensible. The scenery is nice, and there is a moderate amount of production budget in evidence in terms of sets and costumes. The occasional CGI is mostly effective, and there is a particularly pleasing CGI overhead tracking shot which opens the films, which gave me hopes which were never fulfilled.This film is not the disaster it has been painted, but it certainly isn't good. Big mistake number one was the obvious indecisiveness as to whether to go myth or combat, followed by big mistake number two, which was to rehash Gladiator in softcore 300 mode. Big mistake number three, if you need another, was in putting so many poor actors on screen.I did not see the 3D version - we didn't actually get that one at our cinema.",

The character is NOT Hercules, the story is NOT the story of Hercules, the representation of the 'ancient world' has NOTHING to do with ancient Greece of 1200 BC.Its simply the story of a \"Konan like\" character living in an undefined historical period , who could be called Konanis Papadopoulos (if the director insist to present him as Greek) but no way Hercules.Curious thing is that while the real mythological story of Hercules is a very interesting story with all the elements that a viewer would love to watch (monsters, violence, suspense, interesting character, story twists) NOBODY in the history of cinema tried to make a movie really based on it.

The movie already climaxes in the second act and the last half hour is as boring as watching a tree grow.I like Kellan Lutz, but what I don't like is that when the romance storyline is being set up Renny has let him look a tiny bit too awkward in a couple of shots. Or if that was planned, for character dept's sake, I think Renny is overestimating his public. But, but, but, what matters the most is, does it bring the emotions? Yes it does. And very much so. The two first acts are masterfully orchestrated. Man! Reminder. Who's into Hercules? Is it the most steadily dating guys or they who are still looking for their personalities to mature? Correct. Guys who are into Hercules don't like watching other guys lick their princesses, so hide the worst licking in the trailer, or it'll alienate your biggest audience.

The leading character certainly had the physic of Hercules but, he didn't have any screen charisma at all. The storyline wasn't that bad and the fighting scenes were impressive, but it the characters really let the film down. I honesty think that it came out to near the release of Hercules starring a The Rock, which will obviously get the audiences running to the cinema. Anyway, it's not bad if you just want to see some fight scenes without much depth but, if you expecting the true story of Hercules then you will be let down. Average!Round-Up: With such a big budget, the director should have invested in some decent actors. The guy who plays the lead, Kellan Lutz, also starred in the Twilight franchise and he played the lead in that awful movie Arena with Samuel L. Jackson. I don't think that anyone will remember any of his previous roles and I doubt that this film will make his career blossom. You might recognise the girl who plays his mum, Roxanne McKee, who was in Hollyoaks and Eastenders. Anyway, with such a high budget, I was expecting a Troy like movie but, this film will be forgotten after a while.\u00a0Budget: $70million Worldwide Gross: $61millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there epic tales about Hercules using his strength and power to free himself and his friends from captivity. 3/10",

Renny Harlin directed this with a big box office in mind. Aided by an obvious huge budget behind the Hollywood Machine, Harlin tries to provide massive scale battle scenes with battle armor, helmets, swords, and lots of testosterone accept he avoids allowing bloodshed and brutality. Kellan Lutz is cast mainly because he knows a good workout regimen and was fortunately part of the immensely popular Twilight series as Hercules, son of god Zeus and human mother devoted to the gods. His stepfather is an aggressive, hot-headed, intense tyrant, overconfident and often full of rage, with a half-brother that is spineless, jealous, and blinded by the prestige of being the son of a king. Hercules is in love with the beautiful princess, Hebe (Gaia Weiss), but she is to be married off to Iphicles (Liam Garrigan). Hercules and Hebe try to flee from King Amphitryon's (Scott Adkins) kingdom but too many soldiers on horseback made that difficult. Soon Hercules is sent off on a doomsday mission with Captain Sotiris (Liam McIntyre) and small accompaniment of soldiers to face an entrapment in a cavern, surrounded by more men and talented archers. Sold into slavery with Sotiris, Hercules must fight in underground cage matches and woo the man in charge of them, hoping he can get freedom for him and Sotiris by convincing their owner to be sent to combat in the Arena against the greatest of warriors. It all culminates in multiple handicap battles and eventually Hercules facing down his stepfather and half-brother with a revolution underway as soldiers and peasants have grown tired of Amphitryon's tyrannical rule. Before you know it, Iphicles will use Hercules' love for Hebe against him as he battles mano-a-mano with Amphitryon. You get the lovey-dovey Hercules and Hebe make-out scenes quite similar to what you'd see in Twilight between Bella and Edward, in a waterfall lake with flowers and green. It's all yuck, but the audience intended might eat this up. You get plenty of Zeus-influenced powers provided to Hercules as he whips around boulders ripped from pillars holding him in chains and electric bolts that send soldiers reeling. I'm hoping the new Hercules film with the Rock makes this film a fading memory. Sadly, Harlin reduced to this trifle is a shame because I think he can make a fun B-movie with the best of them...trying to PG this kind of fare in the R-rated era of swords, sandals, and sex damages Hercules substantially.",

The Hercules movies thrived in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the shadow of Religious movies like \"Ben-Hur.\" After the heyday of the Italian peplums, Hercules sank back into obscurity. Briefly, the son of Zeus would be revived in the flesh of Lou Ferrigno, but even the Italians couldn't make lightning strike twice. As the first of the two Hercules movies released in 2014, the $70-million \"The Legend of Hercules\" is serviceable, but largely forgettable. You can tell in most scenes that Harlin and company rely on green screens. The artistry in set design, production design, and matte painting is good, but it is so obvious that visual special effects have been used that it undercuts the authenticity of the action.Hercules is an orphan in this outing, and our muscular hero doesn't realize initially that he is the son of Zeus. Hercules' stepfather, the King of Amphitryon (Scott Adkins of \"The Expendables 2\"), is predictably furious when he catches his wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee of \"Vendetta\"), having sex with nobody in her bed and then she gives birth miraculously to the infant Hercules. Not surprisingly, Amphitryon doesn't have much use for Hercules and calls Alcides. The straightforward screenplay draws on \"Gladiator\" in that the King sends Hercules away to be captured and sold into slavery. Eventually, Hercules and his old army friend, Sotiris (Liam McIntyre of \"Niflheim: Blood & Bullets\"), manage to get home. Amphitryon claps Hercules into chains and orders his dastardly son, Iphicles (television actor Liam Garrigan), to slay Chiron (Rade Serbedzija of \"The Saint\") and he executes his father's demand. Hercules begs Zeus to grant him strength and tears cement blocks at the end of his chains out of the masonry. Eventually, Hercules must tangle with his stepfather. Hercules wields a magical sword in the finale that eliminates his opponents until he can face off with Amphitryon.The relatively low-budget harms the film because Hercules doesn't demonstrate his strength in the usual larger-than-life ways. The battle with the lion is routine. The scene where Lutz shines occurs in a gigantic cave when he seizes an archer in his grip. Not only does Hercules physically restrain the archer, but also he uses the man's bow and arrows to kill combatants charging him! Acting wise, Scott Adkins steals the movie with his gusto, while Liam Garrigan is convincingly treacherous. Johnathon Schaech is villainous enough as Tarak who takes Hercules into custody after he wipes out his army. Kellan Lutz has the physical look, but he cannot compete with with Steve Reeves or Reg Park. The only saving grace of \"The Legend of Hercules\" is that Harlin lets us in on variety camera tricks and the problems with using Arabian horses in movies on the audio commentary track of the Blu-ray/DVD presentation. For the record, \"The Legend of Hercules\" was lensed in 3-D rather than converted in post-production. \"The Legend of Hercules\" doesn't wear out its welcome at 98 minutes, but it doesn't tower like the Dwayne Johnson version.",

            "content": "In Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time.Sounds good, trailers make it look good, but unfortunately it's not good. The Legend Of Hercules had all the promise of being such a fantastic mythology film, but it truly failed to deliver, especially considering it's budget. The film is exactly like 300 & Gladiator...300 mainly because of the slow motion usage (which was good for the most part but way overused), and Gladiator because of the exact same story line.Not only that, the characters are just like those from 300 & Gladiator as well. There's too many to list, but the main ones are Scott Adkins (King Amphitryon) tries to be like Gerard Butler (King Leonidas); Liam Garrigan (Iphicles) is very similar to Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus); and Kellan Lutz (Hercules) is like Russell Crowe (Maximus).That is where the similarity ends, however, because the acting is truly awful (especially from the three mentioned above), and the story is really poorly put together. Adkins is so over-the-top it's unreal, plus he's ALWAYS SHOUTING which gets annoying. As with Garrigan, well, let's just say that you can tell he's a TV actor. The performances are just not believable at all from any of them.The only plus side is the stunning visuals, CGI (except the lion), cinematography, and decent action scenes and if it weren't for these, this film would have been a 1-star rating all the way for me. Such a let down and if you choose not to see it then don't worry because you're not missing much.",

Then the movie just went down hill from that.Hercules is played by another really handsome man (I'm not gay) with huge muscles... and that is pretty much it. Hercules is know for his incredible strength but we don't see any of that. He just looks jacked with a pretty face. The acting overall was not horrific, but nowhere near good. I do have to say that King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) was doing a better job than the rest and I couldn't help myself but hoping he would win. The CGI looked good on moments, but the next shot it looked just weird an amateurish. I don't really know what everyone was thinking with this movie but in total it was just meh.I watched this movie once, and by all indications, I like to keep it that way. You can check it out if you want, but don't expect too much.Why can't Hollywood just make a movie out of Hercules' 12 Labours.",

            "content": "The Legend of Hercules is a misnomer; the film butchers the mythology of Hercules to an unrecognizable pulp.Any film about Greek or Roman mythology is going to be difficult. The mythology can be ambiguous and include several historical figures' fates, all with their own rich and diverse back-stories, which can be perplexing. Somehow, the script must take on this complicated task, simplify it and yet retain the tale's integrity.There are many things that are at fault in The Legend of Hercules, first of which is the story. King Amphitryon is a loathsome tyrant whom Queen Alcmene despises and wishes to overthrow somehow. Born and conceived to be the savior of Ancient Greece by his mother Queen Alcmene with Zeus, Hercules is a prince. Hercules' older brother Iphicles resents Hercules for his strength, leadership and mother's love. Hercules' paramour Hebe, the Princess of Crete, is to marry his brother Iphicles as a union of their lands. Hercules and Hebe dare to pursue their love in spite of the arrangement and a clash of sovereignty gets underway.At face value this is what happened in the film. This is also only the first twenty minutes of the film, your guess is as good as mine for the rest. Besides the mythological origin story of Hercules there is little mythology anywhere else. Hera is reduced to a melancholic prophetess witch. And Hercules is instead in the middle of a political upheaval for power.Secondly, the characters are pretty abysmal. The story has no development of any relationships and you sense no history between the characters. Hercules is reduced to a stoic barbarian. Kellan Lutz's impression of Hercules can be summarized as a muscular man who speaks loudly, lacks any emotion, always runs into battle scenes snarling, and scrunches his eyebrows.Third key feature causing the inevitable demise of this film is the action scenes! This is an action movie, and they are horrible. Any chance to marvel at the abilities of the actors and stuntmen is ruined by Renny Harlin's decision to always have the action sequence in slow-motion, in every single scene, every single time! Harlin also overly stylizes the film, ripping off movies like 300.The Legend of Hercules wanted to be an epic film packed with intense battles and a simple story of love and one man's purpose. It was instead a big disappointment and waste of time.More film reviews can be found at our website.",

I enjoyed that there was a strong romantic element in the story. I was also highly impressed by many of the backdrops (settings/scenery) and found them to be quite artistic in conception. As such they added significantly to my enjoyment of the action and the unfolding drama.Gaia Weiss and Roxanne McKee as Hebe and Queen Alcmene, when on screen, were always a delight to watch - not only because they are both exceedingly beautiful anyway and acted their parts well, but also because I happen to really like the Grecian styling of their clothes and hairstyles.Kellan Lutz delivered a fine performance as Hercules. He is an actor who's future career I shall definitely be following with eager anticipation. Other supporting actors' and actresses' contributions were all well up to the same high standard as the main leads.(As at least one other reviewer has said) I'm glad I didn't let the many negative reviews I'd read (on IMDb.com) put me off seeing this film. I'm awarding the film a 10, not only to offset the ridiculously low ratings it's been getting (as mentioned), but also because it's quite simply everything an action/historical/mythological/adventure film ought to be!Highly recommended. 10/10.",

This $70 million production stars Kellan Lutz in the title role and costars Scott Adkins, Gaia Weiss, Roxanne McKee, Liam Garrigan, Liam McIntyre and Johnathon Schaech. It was written by Harlin, Sean Hood, Daniel Giat and Giulio Steve. The movie was a bomb at the box office (making just over $44 million worldwide) and I can see why. It's extremely dry and mostly boring; with a few decent action scenes throughout though. The story begins in 1200 B.C. ancient Greece when Queen Alcmene (McKee) makes love to the God Zeus; in order to give birth to a demigod that's promised to overthrow the evil rule of her husband, King Amphitryon (Adkins). The baby is named Alcides by his father (who despises him, knowing he's not his son) and Hercules by his mother (in secret). Herules (Lutz) grows up to be a strong and kind prince who does not know his true origins. He loves Hebe (Weiss) but she's betrothed to his older brother, Iphicles (Garrigan), and Hercules is sent off to do battle in Egypt (prior to their wedding). Once there Hercules and the other soldiers, led by Captain Sotiris (McIntyre), are ambushed and Hercules is believed to have been killed (back home). He then must do battle as a gladiator type slave (in several arena fights) before earning his freedom and finding his way back to Greece. Once home Hercules must decide whether to follow his destiny or not.For a $70 million film it looks pretty ugly; the effects aren't that great and the performances are pretty weak. I do like Scott Adkins and he makes a great villain but Lutz and most of the rest of the cast are horrible. Lutz does look the part but he doesn't possess one-tenth of the charisma and character that The Rock does (I'm really looking forward to seeing that version of this story). Harlin used to be a decent action flick director (back when he did movies like 'DIE HARD 2' and 'CLIFFHANGER') but lately he definitely appears to be just a hack. None of the characters are likable in this film and the action scenes aren't at all exciting or fun to watch. The film is mostly just a bore; it's not horrible but it is pretty dull.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9aLxA71Z4k",

There is such a rich and bountiful history behind the demi-god, so many tales that would easily make great movies, but instead we get this.From the director of action classics such as Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger, comes this steaming pile of crap straight from the butthole of a $70 million project.What even was this movie? The Hercules done by Brett Ratner was coming out later that year (which turned out to be far better than this), so why was this one necessary?Acting - I don't think you can call any of this acting, just people reciting lines with either shouty voices or normal voices. Okay... - Kellen Lutz is not Hercules. Dwayne the Rock Johnson was more believable as Hercules. - Scott Adkins was wasted (not that he's a great actor). If you've seen his movies, you know what he's good for...sweet fist fight action sequences. He has one in this but it's poorly done. - The bad guys were just acting like over-the-top douche bags with no layered performances.Story - The romance plot line took up way too much time. It wasn't believable, or touching, in fact, it was quite dead and emotionless and I felt nothing for the to lovebirds. - There is 1 labor performed in this film, the Nemean Lion. It was rushed and lackluster, poorly executed. - It feels too much like Ben-Hur, Spartacus and Gladiator, 10/10 films. But they had layered characters, superb writing, an emotional story line and brilliant acting and this has none of those things. It doesn't feel original and it isn't even done well so you can't forgive it for being unoriginal.Action - (Cinematography and Editing) - It's PG-13 so there's no meatiness to the fights - There's no blood or real visceral violence of any kind - Looks like a bunch of people rolling around swinging wildly, mixed in with some WWE performances - Clone of 300, or Immortals. Same style, but poorly executed. - No point to slow motion because there's nothing impressive happening and there's no blood flying across the screen. - Cuts away when anything cool might happen - It just feels boring to watch - This is the most decent thing about the movie though, soooooooo...Costumes and Set Design - Costumes just look cheap - Sets look cheap - Backgrounds sometimes look like paintings - When they don't look like paintings they look like terrible animation - Terrible animation complimented by wonky green screen blending - Why did so much have to be CGI if it was garbage? Why not create a miniature model of the city and film that rather than create an obviously fake, video-game looking world?Writing - Dialogue is cringey, cheesy, corny, terrible....take your pick. - Nothing feels tense. - Characters might as well be 2D cut- outs. There's no layering to any of them. They're either good or bad. None are tormented or have problems. Take for example Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus - clearly disturbed and vile, tormented by his thoughts and emotions. That's a character. - Come to think of it, I don't think there was an actual script, just dot points written by 4 dudes in a room.Music - UninspiredSound Design - UninspiredMovie Overall - UninspiredRating 2/10What on earth actually happened here?

I guess is the same reason that got me to give it a \"10\" - the Son of God parallel. This might be the spoiler: There is a scene there where Hercules is whipped and a mean Greek asks him, paraphrasing \"You, self-proclaimed Son of Zeus, what savior are you for those people when you can't even save yourself?\" That was genius, in my opinion, and the timing with Son of God just made it so delicious!

Directed by Renny Harlin and co-written by Daniel Giat, Giulio Steve and Sean Hood, this film star Kellan Lutz, Gaia Weiss, Scott Adkins, Liam Garrigan and Roxanne McKee. It is delightful for any full time writer to write a review on this film.The film stars Kellan Lutz as the mythical hero Hercules and depicts the story of this brave Grecian warrior. This is a story of love, lust and bravery where a beautiful Grecian queen succumbs to the advances of Zeus, god of sky and thunder, to bear his demigod son Hercules. He is half-man and half god, blessed with super human strength, whose fate is to overthrow a repressive and tyrant ruler who is also his step-father. He has taken birth to bring peace to a land which suffers only hardship. But unfortunately, Prince Hercules knows nothing of his real identity or his predetermined destiny which is to depose of his step father \u2013 the king. In his growing up years, Hercules is shown as an ordinary boy with footloose ways and desperately seeking the love of a fair maiden named Hebe. Hebe is the Princess of Crete and engaged to be married to Hercules's own brother. In spite of knowing that his brother is set to marry her, he pursues her. This angers the king who was looking for an excuse to banish him from his kingdom. Hercules is betrayed by his stepfather who exiles him and sells him to slavery to punish him for his forbidden love. It is when he is in exile that Hercules learns the truth about himself-about his powers and about his purpose and the lover boy changes into a warrior man. It is a time to choose whether to flee with Hebe or stay and use his immense powers to fulfill his mission of fighting his way back to his rightful kingdom by overthrowing the king and become the true hero of his time.The Legend of Hercules is the latest offering from the makers of Olympus Has Fallen. This film is a visual treat for the viewers. It has stunning locale and breathtaking gladiator scenes where death matches have been played. The film's trailer was released on October 13, 2013. The film has the potential to make its viewers feel positively content with it and transfer them into an ancient Greece where Hercules embarked on a legendary odyssey to reclaim his right.

            "content": "I saw \"The Legend of Hercules\", starring Kellan Lutz-The Twilight movies, Immortals; Gaia Weiss-Mary Queen of Scots; Liam McIntyre- Spartacus:War of the Damned-t.v., Ektopos and Scott Adkins-Zero Dark Thirty, The Bourne Ultimatum.This is an action-packed origin story of the Greek mythological hero, Hercules. It's directed by Renny Harlin-12 Rounds, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Die Hard 2-and it was filmed in Bulgaria. It starts with Scott conquering a kingdom and claiming it for himself-he is not a very nice person. His wife gives birth to Hercules, but seeing as how she is mad at Scott for his general egotistical attitude, she makes a pact with the king of the gods, Zeus, to be the biological dad of Hercules. Kellan plays Hercules at the age of about 20 and since this is a new, aimed-at- the-young-teens-origin, there also has to be a love story. Gaia plays the love of his life and there is even one scene where she is telling someone how much she loves Kellan and she says things like, 'If his face was scared up, I would still love him. If his voice could not talk, I would still love him, etc, etc'. Man, that is teen-aged Twilight style loving, if you ask me. Since Kellan is still young, he does not have his full Hercules strength yet, but he definitely knows how to leap high in the air and how to fight in slow-motion-there is a lot of those two things going on; it kind of reminded me of 300. Never fear, he does get some of his fabled strength and some fancy new lightening-styled powers, later in the movie. Liam plays a captain of the guards that befriends Kellan and becomes his handy side-kick in his leaping and slow-motion battles. This is not the first Hercules movie-I kind of prefer the Steve Reeves version, myself-nor, I'm sure, will this be the last. It's rated \"PG-13\" for the violence and sexual content-no nudity here- and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes. I would probably buy this on DVD but most people I know would rather rent it.",

In this day and age, Millennium Films is the new Cannon, and when I learned they made their own Hercules movie, I knew sooner or later I had to see it. What made it more interesting was that this movie was made with a lot more money than the Cannon Hercules movies. Maybe, just maybe, they could make a genuinely good Hercules movie.Sadly, that didn't happen. And the movie also happens to not be bad in a hilarious way - just bad. I could go on for some time talking about the bad stuff in this movie. There are the cheesy computer generated special effects, the choppy editing, the very simplistic story, the poor direction... the list just goes on and on. But what bothered me the most about this movie was that it really wasn't a Hercules movie. 99% of what the \"Hercules\" in this movie does could be attributed to a mere mortal who happened to be very good in combat. There's almost NOTHING of super strength or other god-like powers here! And the way the story is plotted comes across more like a rip-off of movies like \"Gladiator\" or \"300\". There's almost nothing about gods or epic quests here. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it were revealed that the screenplay was originally written as a \"Gladiator\" or \"300\" clone, and when it got into the hands of Millennium Films, they tinkered with it slightly to pass it off as a Hercules movie. But in the end, the Lou Ferrigno movies, as cheap and unintentionally hilarious as they are, are much closer to the spirit of Hercules than this movie.",

First of all the acting was terrible (no offense to anyone who did like the acting) and the storyline was long and pretty dull. The storyline was very long and i just wanted the film to end. I managed to sit through it all and it was just terrible. As i said i like films which are Greek-based and usually find them very cool to watch but this was just total rubbish. I brought my family to watch it and they all agreed too.I highly recommend you don't go pay to see this at the cinema but if you do want to see it to wait for it to come on DVD.

A reinvention of the myth of Hercules that has nothing to do with the story of Hercules, an actor that looks handsome, but acts like a bag of bricks, together with his friend, Liam McIntyre, who has no charisma at all in this, less even than in Spartacus.Plot: there was none. Hercules has the hots for a girl, psychopath step father disapproves, brother is a coward and a bitch and wants her, so he kills them and gets the girl. The problem was that none of the characters, beginning with Hercules and ending with the girl he loves, were the least empathic.

Liam Mcntyre as Sotiris the General brought real emotion to the film 10/10 performance. Scott Adkins did a decent job as the evil King 7/10. Even the character Chiron played by Rade Serbedzija 8/10. The sets for Argos and Tyran were believable, and the villages. The fight scenes were good for pg 13. But everything else was a letdown and rushed. Every time the Movie took a step forwards, after it would take 2 steps back. The costumes looked like halloween costumes, Kellen lutz and the rest of the cast are terrible at bringing any emotion to the movie. I don't blame them, Kellen tried as Hercules. The setting and terminology they used was so historically bad I wanted to cry. The Director brought the movie down with terrible CGI, and camera movement. The script was bad also. Renny tried to make a Peplum film but fell short. Granted He did give it a try and tipped his hat to Steve Reeves as the real Hercules. What annoys me most is that the budget for this is 70 MILLION DOLLARS!! THE EXACT SAME AS 300. It looked like it was shot for 8 Million. Where was the rest of the money spent? I don't know but I can say this safely that if your in the right mindset, you might kind of enjoy this movie. but wait for Brett Ratners version",

The fighting scenes are really hopeless and just looked like a cheap rip off of Spartacus....oh and the Spartacus actor is in it too but his character is really weak and confusing.

            "content": "Sometimes a movie that bombs turns out to be a perfectly adequate or even sometimes terrific movie. So I went into The Legend of Hercules hoping to discover audiences were wrong. They weren't. Every bad review is pretty much dead on. I can't even figure out what the film makers were trying to do with this mess. With the rampant success of Game of Thrones and films like 300, this should be an easy film to make at least interesting enough to bring in the crowd. I spent this entire film looking for some sort of sign that this was Hercules. As far as I can tell (and I've done my share of studying Ancient Greek history) there is no sign of anything that makes the famous Greek hero what he is. They say there are no original ideas left in Hollywood but this blatantly rips off 300's style and cinematography implying that it doesn't need to do any more than that. Every scene is wrought with melodramatic dialogue delivered poorly at best. Every fight scene uses ridiculous looking slow motion techniques to make it look even more dramatic and the music in the background is far more exciting than what you're actually watching. The dialogue is ridiculously hokey and is attempting to channel some sort of Shakespeare but falls on its face being delivered so terribly.Kellan Lutz might have a career in Hollywood ahead of him as a leading man but this film will do absolutely nothing to prove he can do it. Lutz hardly says anything and when he does it sounds forced and silly. It seems as though he doesn't even try and they do absolutely nothing to show that his character is Hercules. This film could have been called anything because it has nothing to do with Hercules and Lutz has zero screen chemistry. He's barely noticeable. Not to be outdone our main heroine is played by Gaia Weiss who is excruciating on screen. I have rarely seen such little chemistry between two romantic leads as Lutz and Weiss. I couldn't have cared less about their romance and that's unfortunate. Ironically, a performance that wasn't outright terrible was Scott Adkins. He looked the part of the King and wasn't bad when delivering the terrible dialogue. He had his share of campy moments and he wasn't great, don't misunderstand me, but he was better than terrible. The best actual performance in the film is by Liam McIntyre as Hercules' right hand man Sotiris. He has some genuinely good scenes and actually appears to be trying. It can't be easy given the rest of the cast and movie. Liam Garrigan is practically a joke and looks ridiculous as our \"villain.\" I could talk about others in the film but really they are all bad.Renny Harlin has done some decent films. He's never really had an \"amazing\" movie, the closest is maybe Die Hard 2 but he should still be ashamed of this mess. Granted the script is so bad (which apparently he co-wrote with three others) so this squarely lies on his shoulders. The movie is so bad that even the action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are so underwhelming. Each one is the same as the next and the slow motion bogs down everything. The blatant use of 3D technology (I watched in 2D) makes this seem even more campy. I am certain even Asylum films could have made a better so called \"Hercules\" movie than this. At times (especially near the end scenes) they seem to be trying to channel some sort of \"Jesus\" type story with Hercules but there is nothing here that even implies this is the Hercules of Greek legends. If I had to watch Lutz leap through the air in slow motion one more time I was going to be sick. I am genuinely surprised that I couldn't find much of anything redemptive here in this movie. It is such a hard genre to get wrong. Reviewers made horrible fun of \"Pompeii\" which was also very campy but I can promise you it was twice the movie this was. I hold out high hopes now for the next Hercules movie starring Dwayne Johnson because it wouldn't take much for them to make a better movie than this. This one is a dud. Thank goodness for them they had a 70 Million dollar budget to at least make it look professional. 4/10",

It is the single-worst movie I've ever paid money to see; I've never missed Kevin Sorbo so much. Hell, even Eddie Murphy was a better Hercules than Kellan Lutz.The acting, except for Scott Adkins, McIntyre, and Rada Serbedzija, is terrible, but that's mostly due to the direction and the bad screenplay. The story is a mish-mash of 300's slow-motion, Gladiator's story with some Spartacus thrown in, and The Princess Bride's love triangle.The effects are awful, and the cinematography/editing are so bad. There are obvious uses of green-screen and reusing footage. During the climax, they reused one shot from about twenty minutes in, but changed it to night and added some torches. Then, they showed Hercules and his army AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BRIDGE!! Especially the final scene.And let's just say there's a huge cop-out at the ending. Basically, the brother, who's mostly Commodus, holds the love interest at knife-point to keep Hercules from killing Amphytrion; the love interest \"stabs\" herself and him (which is obviously under the arm). Hercules holds her in his arms, showing her wound on her chest near her heart. Then, the scene goes white and shows her and Hercules with a baby, alive and well. WTF!? EXPLAIN, MOVIE, EXPLAIN!!!! A friend and I saw this movie, and the theater only had about 10-12 people in it. We were in there cracking jokes, from Gladiator to Avatar: The Last Airbender. During the scene where Hercules and his friend fight the other two guys in the arena, my friend shouts, \"Go back to the Fire Nation.\" I respond, \"The Boulder is going to bury the competition!!\" Basically, this is the worst movie of 2014 so far.

It never claims mythological accuracy , and how accurate should we be when its a myth anyways ?The fact is that it is a shallow movie. Not very coherent.

A bit disappointed. There are so many ways you can go when you write a mythological character. Go for drama with well thought out action , or go for the effects extravaganza and a flamboyant hero. This is, well, its nothing. Hercules is a tormented hero, not wanted by his stepfather ,hunted by his true fathers wife (Hera).

That changed when I read few of the reviews on this movie. I really don't understand how some people can bash this movie so hard, it's with great restraint that I refrain from name-calling because it would only diminish rest of the review.For all those who complain this is the worst movie ever and give it only one star i would like to tell you to get over yourself. I watched movies like Machete which have a rating of 6,7 right now. Talk about bad movie. I remember feeling like throwing up in my mouth figuratively speaking because as I mentioned earlier I don't really mind gore or obscene scenes but the move was so tasteless and boring and totally without any point. I still gave it a 2 star just for having famous actors in it and maybe it had one or two lines hidden in there that was slightly funny. These are my counterarguments to some of the issues brought up by those that left bad reviews.Inaccurate story? The story does not follow the usual path of the original Hercules myth. But that is what it is. A MYTH. Hercules is not real. Even if it was about something that actually had happen (like Jesus or whatever), it is a movie not a documentary so they can choose how to adapt it however they damn want! Then there is talk about equipment and clothes that aren't Greek. Seriously those kind of inaccuracies is in like every movie that portrays the past. Beside if you aren't familiar with the fashions of greeks from the ancient times you won't notice it, and even if you are familiar, it's hard to believe it's that bothersome. Special effects I admit that the lion was awful and ridiculous but the rest wasn't bad. Action I really liked the action scenes. I have not seen the movie \"300\" that so many reviewers says have been copied here, but c'mon to do something totally original today is almost impossible, of course it's doable to do that and get a good movie but but then we would only have like 3 to 5 movies a year to watch, maybe even less. (I know the statistics of the former phrase is off, the point is that it would be very few). I think the haters are just disappointed it wasn't more gore. There's even a few that claims that Hercules story is only about the gore. Don't get me wrong here I'm not against gore, I really, with big emphasis, don't mind me some well placed gore but I don't mind the lack of it in this movie. Acting I might be a bit biased when it comes to Kellan Lutz. In my POV he's a total heartthrob. I don't really have a grip on his acting yet partially to the rolls he have chosen but it's at least well above a five star out of ten. I think it will be more when he learns which rolls fits him and when he have more experience and diverse resume. I just want to make myself clear. Yes, I am a Lutz fan BUT I'm not a Twilight fan. Don't put me in the same group as them and thereby discard me as a little girl with a crush on cheesy. The other actors was also very good. I don't get why there is so much bitching about bad actors and bad acting. I mean I'm usually pretty easily annoyed with bad acting and nothing raised my eyebrow here. Overall To be honest I would probably have rated a 7 or 8 (or without Kellan; 6-7) if it wasn't for this already incredibly skewed rating. I gave it a ten in hope to repair little of the damage it didn't deserve. The movie was definitely enjoyable. I like the new take on Hercules where he is more human and normal man. I like fantasy, here it was toned down a lot but sometimes less is more. The pace was a bit fast but i guess it had to be for having time for everything. I would liked for the movie to be a little longer so that they would have time to deepen the characters.I hope this is readable and since the clock is 4am when I'm writing this, I just needed to get this of my chest so i can leave it behind me and go to bed.

An estimated budget of $70,000,000 \u2013 allow me to repeat that bit \u2013 70 million dollars, went into making this, and yet, I've watched cheese graters with far more character than this dull, tedious, dire, tiresome, drudgery. I cannot stress how truly awful this movie is. They took that budget and, somehow, managed to make one seriously bad TV movie. This is the type of movie you find by pure accident while tuning an Ekco TMB 272 valve TV at some cheap motel during a heat-wave on the outskirts of that place where the navy conducted that time warp Philadelphia Experiment, and you are inexplicably waiting on a dilapidated Fageol Safety Coach, with no air conditioning and Bakelite seats, to take you to some dirt-track airstrip where they still charter Sopwith Camels \u2013 and if you're feeling particularly bold \u2013 Zeppelins or Dirigibles. Alright, that maybe a slight exaggeration, but I'd watch a film with that storyline long before I'd ever watch the rest of this green toe fungus. I do not need to repeat what others have said, but this movie should come with a health warning, I watched most of this movie and it cured my insomnia, but it gave me rickets and perhaps, although the test results are still pending, a new strain of bacterial eyeball infection that has confounded medical science. This movie is like the twisted Hills-Have-Eyes love-child of 300, Gladiator, Troy, Monty Python, Breaking Wind Part 1, and Prince of Space. This movie has had to be some sort of tax dodge benefit system for the crew who made it; otherwise, the cold hard cash that went into this was fake play money because stylistically this movie was bad, the acting was horrible, the weird sets bizarrely lacking as if it was filmed in someone's back garden, with curious lighting and cinematography, and last but not least, desperate dialogue and delivery \u2013 a masterpiece of unpleasantness.

Wanting to end his rule and restore peace his wife decides to give in to Zeus and give him a son they name Hercules (Lutz). Not knowing his identity or destiny he lives a normal life. After the King announces a wedding between his son and the woman Hercules is in love with Hercules is sent off to fight a battle that is doomed to fail and kill all involved. After surviving and learning the truth about his life he vows to return to his home and fulfill his destiny. I will open by saying that I have never been a big fan of these types of movies. That said, even if I was a fan I don't think I would have liked this movie anymore then I did. This is really nothing more then a mix of every movie of this genre thrown together into one big generic mess. It really felt like a spoof type movie where 20 different movies are combined to make one new one, but this was without the comedy. The biggest problem I had with this movie though is that to keep the PG-13 rating they had to sacrifice some things...like blood. When you see a 5 minute fight scene that looks really brutal and you see the person die dramatically then you see the body and it looks like nothing happened at all the effectiveness of the scene is lost. Again though I am not a fan of this type of movie so if you may like it if you are a fan of 300, Conan, Immortals, The Eagle, etc...you may like this as well. Overall, hard for me to get into.

Maybe the big stars don't believe in him that may lead him to recruit second stream actors.The romance portions were too bad, no chemistry, physics, mathematics, nothing, but just an ordinary without the feelings. When it comes to the game of throne, that's looked okay as it scripted like 'snakes and ladders' game. Anyway, it was a well known story among most of us which was altered and told somewhat differently. Disappoint is there though still somehow watchable.Don't force yourself for this, because you are not going to miss any masterpiece. It's becoming a habit in Hollywood, like I already mentioned in a review a year ago that two same thematic movies coming out of a same period.

To be honest, I don't have a lot of good comments for this movie, I just didn't think it was as terrible as everyone claimed. In my opinion the acting was poor with the exception of two people who ironically have the same first name, Liam Garrigan and Liam McIntyre, and Kellan Lutz was certainly not fit to play the role of the main character. He may have had brawn but the extent of his acting was a few seconds of puppy dog eyes at the camera and it wasn't impressive. The fight scenes weren't awful but they were mediocre and a bit boring at times. Many people have likened the style of the fights to that of Gladiator and it did have that feel to but Gladiator was much much better. My biggest problem with the show was the lion. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at something so hokey in my life. The attempt at making the lion look menacing was even funnier.

Well, first of all the pacing is atrocious. Some scenes go on for ever, some cut away almost in the middle of the sentence. The story is told in short snippets that don't tie together at all. The way scenes are supposed to seamlessly blend from one to another is one of those things you only really notice when it's not there, and here the editor has probably never even heard about it.The actors are also subpar. Kellan Lutz as Hercules is convincing in the physical sense - even though facially he looks more like a thug than a Greek demigod - but he and the rest of the cast have next to no screen presence, Scott Adkins notwithstanding.The CGI is also terrible, though that's probably the budget.The thing the movie gets somewhat right is the action. There are some really nice fight sequences, reminding me of 300 at its best. Sure the limited special effects mean that they lack that final awe factor, but they're still suitably impressive. Also, the story, while kind of basic and clumsily told, could be a lot worse and doesn't really contain any major faults.As a whole The Legend of Hercules is a big disappointing mess. There's some charm to it, and if you're a fan of Renny Harlin's personal style, then this might be worth a watch. The rest of you should look elsewhere.",

Probably the best parts of the movie. 2. Costumes: A They did very well here though not sure on accuracy especially since the idea of when/if he existed is debatable. 3. Graphics: F-A Some things were just lame (rolling eyes or hanging head lame) and yet they did a lot of 300 moves that turned out nice and saved them.4. Acting: C Problem here is that I think acting depends greatly on the director as much as their skills.5. Script: F- Do I really need to say anything else? The grade should say enough. Awkward, corny, and pointless at best. Add poor delivery and it was a disaster. 6. Story: C- I'll be nice. As one other said, the 'gladiator' idea was kind of overused. Thankfully they didn't call them gladiators. If you know ancient Greek history, you will pick out a lot of inaccuracies. At best, it's a rental. Good thing I get a discount on the my tickets.

However, much of the acting, setups, staging, script along with the special effects are not as balanced or on a par with some of the recent historic and fantasy TV show offerings, which out grit The Legend of Hercules. The majority of actors are left to chew on the dialogue, that said Liam McIntyre is notable and comes though unscathed along with some of the sets and locations. The costumes are nicely designed and the score by Tuomas Kantelinen is effective. Nevertheless, the handful of writers including Harlin throw in large scale (The Mummy-like) battles, slow motion fights, arena showdowns, lies and betrayal, love and loss. However, the uneven tone shifts often and emulates too many others of its genre, and struggles find it's own identity, shoehorning a love story hampers the already rocky flick. This incarnation doesn't become as engaging as it needs or wants to be which is a shame given the subject matter.It borrows from the best and there's nothing wrong with that, it just doesn't have enough execution nor conviction leaving it with a 2002 television feel rather than a filmatic quality which Harlin has delivered in the past.

After seeing this movie, it's difficult to realize that Harlin actually directed films like 'Cliffhanger' and 'Die Hard 2', because whatever directing chops he had in the action genre were not available anywhere here. This PG-13 film tries to be '300' throughout its 90 minute run-time, but due to the terrible script, awful acting, poorly choreographed fight scenes, and laughable special effects, makes it seem more like a made-for-TV-movie on the Lifetime channel.I mean, if you're going to have over 1,000 people die in your movie, you're gonna need at least one drop of blood. However, that's not the case with this flick as we don't see any blood, let alone anyone getting stabbed or shot with an arrow, as the camera always seems to cut away at the last moment as it goes back and forth from slow-motion to normal speed.Nobody's favorite vampire brother Kellan Lutz, plays Hercules and is as dry as they come. He has no charisma, charm, or wit about him. Sure he can yell at the sky and he has a chiseled body, but that's as far as it goes. We catch Hercules in his 20th year of life as he is frolicking with his love interest in the water. Meanwhile, back at home, his older brother is a mean, jealous sibling who will one day take over his evil tyrant father's throne and marry his brother's girl.But before that can happen, Hercules must find out that he really is the son of the God of Gods, and therefor unstoppable.This doesn't bode will for good movie making, because there is never a moment where we the audience feel like Hercules is in any real danger. Even when we see him sold into slavery and forced to fight six warriors at the same time in the vein of 'Gladiator'. And what would a Hercules movie be, if he didn't find a giant lion with his bare hands and win?This is a huge let-down for everyone involved, as not one aspect of this film was executed well with the exception of the first two minutes where we see a long track shot of Spartans charging a kingdom.

From the opening scene where arrows are flying out of the screen in a shot made for 3D as we hover past a giant army at war, to the end credits, nearly every shot offered strong 3D layering in The Legend of Hercules with some great pop outs and particle effects (spears, arrows, rain, smoke, flower puffs over the pond, etc).",

While I won't say it is the best thing I have ever seen it was quite entertaining. Some parts were a little clumsy and overacted but overall there were some strong action sequences with plenty of fighting, weapons and special effects. The story was also fairly strong. Hercules is a common tale but The Legend of Hercules took the story into a different direction. I found it to be more realistic and less supernatural than others which was a nice change of pace.It reminded me a little of the old school TV shows Hercules and Xena with a little bit of The Scorpion King. Extremely dramatic, with mediocre acting but for some reason it works. It's not everyone's cup of tea but pretty good.",

            "content": "Good stories of mythological demigods have been done well on film, perhaps not accurately but emotionally true to the originals. Troy, starring Brad Pitt, was one. Although the characters (particularly the women) were combined and juggled, and much was left out, the film captured Achilles' great conflict. He leaves home to pursue his immortality and ends up discovering his humanity. This certainly puts it far above the leering gym rat testosterone festival movies like this version of Hercules. Homer's Iliad, largely the basis for the movie Troy, is generally better film material if you're concerned with story arc rather than special effects, and they were. But The Labors of Hercules, if they actually use the mythological story, is better suited to special effects muscle films even if the film makers don't do all twelve. The thing is, the writers and director have to get it right. Homer and other ancient authors don't belabor their points, and they are writing for people of another age, with very different values. It will be interesting to see if The Rock version of Hercules preserves any of the classic -- the story of Hercules' desire to become a full demigod, and complete a meaningful penance for his earlier murder of his wife and children. To do this as a whole is, I think, more suited for a limited TV series if it is to capture each unique chapter without straying too far from the theme of guilt and redemption. If they do it as a movie, I can only hope the writers will put in the reading and study up front,as the writers of Troy obviously did.",

            "content": "The Legend Of Hercules carries on the unnecessary recent trend of the 2 same movies being released in the same year. It also continues the trend of January being the cinematic rubbish bin where some of the worst films of the year are released. January 2014, although it's been a strong year for films, was no different. TLOH is an origins story of Hercules, which is one of my favourite Greek Myths. However, this is not Hercules. The Greek Gods play almost no part, Hercules kills the Nemean lion even though he's not doing his labours yet and Chiron isn't a centaur so this is even more insulting to Greek mythology than the 2 dreadful Clash Of The Titans duds. To be fair to this film, it's not one of those things which is so awful it's painful to watch. It's very distant, bland and unengaging and it passes too quickly to do too much damage. Still, the film is so boring and uninterested in its audience its like watching a tortoise go from one end of a long room to the other while watching from a distance through a large pane of glass. It's that dull.The acting is absolutely atrocious, with Kellan Lutz making Taylor Lautner look compelling, while the storyline is the most routine, stereotypical and dramatically listless thing I've had the misfortune to see for a long time. Die Hard 2 and Deep Blue Sea are good movies and judging by the shocks in the latter you'd think Renny Harlin was a decent director but here, although some of the shots are interesting, it's just loads of painfully tedious fight scenes. There are only so many times I can watch Hercules jump through the air in slow motion before I start to nod off. The film even dares to be similar to Gladiator. It's easily the worst film of 2014 so far. It's not interesting at all, and in terms of visuals and audience engagement can be compared to a broken, glitchy and mind numbingly stupid kids video game. I, Frankenstein was awful too, but at least that was slightly more watchable. You may think the Dwayne Johnson one looks awful but at least it'll be better than this.1/10",

He's a fine stumpen alrite. heeheh. But as far as the plot is concerned twas quite on the challenging side of figurien it out. Normally I don't read up the reviews of a film I go to see for the first time. Now I must admit, I had a sneak preview on IMDb. Link will be provided below as per usual. But from what I could understand in the movie of where I got the plot fully is as follows. Hercules is born as a god like the way Jesus was. as in I think a demi- god like Percy Jackson(Son of Poseidon) to a Queen. The King thinks the Queen had an affair and as naturally is mad. He forces his son Iphicles(Excuse the spelling) and Hebes to wed. However there' s a slight problem, and that problem is my sexy hunk Hercules. Hercules is in love with Hebes. \"Even if he is a memory to me, I still love him\". I went to the film, as it was described as \"Twilight heartthrob... Kellen\". By George did that live to its description. He is some heartthrob alrite. So Hercules found out that the King killed his mother ie the Queen. Initially throughout the film, he wasn't acceptance of his Godship not even acknowledging his father was a God(Zeus). So when he had heard of the murder of his mother and now his mentor(the Auld fella - Chiron I think) Hercules goes on a rampage. Overall a wonderful film to a great history lesson. Oh and one more item, the voice of Hercules soooooo sooothing.",

Because it that is the case then they succeeded incredibly well.With special effects that look dated even in this day and age of incredible technology and a story that just barely trudges along, \"The Legend of Hercules\" is a film that takes the already interesting story of the demi-god Hercules and makes it a lethargic mess that looks like it overdosed on heavy tranquilizers. And the saddest part\u2014even sadder than the fact that the \"dumb\" vampire from \"Twilight\" was cast to play the hero for no other reason than he had a good build and acting wasn't a requirement\u2014is the fact that the Disney animated version of Hercules has more intense action and better fight scenes.The fight scenes were viciously watered down to the point that they barely qualify as fight scenes and look more like they were filming a description of what action is suppose to look like from a lifelong pacifist who secretly hates Hercules. In fact, the action sequences were just as dull and unimaginative as the story and as lifeless as Kellan Lutz's performance as the Greek mythological hero. The only real shining element of the film is the fact it serves as a reminder that a Hercules movie that stars The Rock is coming out and just having that man in the film already makes that film infinitely superior in every way. In fact, just knowing The Rock is in it already makes the case that the acting is better, the story is more exciting and the action is vastly more satisfying.Greetings, Earthling!

Plot: 4/10 Not sure how accurate this was to the original mythology., but I grew up with the Disney version. The story itself seemed chopped and fast paced. To quickly it went from one thing to another. The entire film takes place in the span of a few days, so you are getting this rushed feeling the entire time you are watching it. Even the final battle was anticlimactic, and so was the romance, like romeo and Juliet. The movie was very predictable in my own opinion and even my 11 yr old brother was calling out what would happen next. Visuals: 4/10 I would have marked it lower, but there honestly was some very good cinematography. There were some scenes that were very beautiful. But for the most part, the majority of the film was cheap cgi and obvious green screen (or whatever color screen they use now). Scenes like the waterfall scene at the very beginning where hercules takes a dive looks like someone photographed him in that position then threw the photo down the waterfall. Honestly I was hoping for something visually striking like 47 Ronin, but was very sadly mistaken.Sex/Nudity: 2/10 *Spoiler* One \"sex\" scene at the very beginning were zeus (who is invisible) has sex with the queen in her tent. Though it just looks like she is self pleasing herself under the cover. There is no nudity in the film.Profanity: 1/10 I had subtitles on, I don't recall any profanity. Maybe the use of damn and other swear words, but no F*cks or any other hardcore language.Violence: 6/10 Not much blood, at least compared with 300. The fighting scenes are kind of cool. Some off it seems like a rip off of other fight scenes like Leonidas' last stand in 300. The cgi ruined some of the fight scenes since it was so blatantly obvious it was fake. All in all, hardly any blood and no guts.This movie was rather a disappointment and i wont go out of my way to watch it again.",

The unconvincing and jerky CGI in the action sequences was very annoying and if it isn't skillful enough to be undetectable it should be reserved for cartoons only. The older films that used real actors and sets are far more realistic, naturally. I wish 300 had never been made, it was bloated and idiotic and has apparently had the undesirable effect of making shoddy, unrealistic epics acceptable.

Everybody's sick of 3D so that's why they dropped the first one. Then they must have seen a rough cut of the film an realized it was never going to be a franchise so they settled for the last one. In the first 10 minutes it becomes clear that they're ripping of '300'. Tons of slomotion fights and the same sephia like color palette. After Mr. H gets sold into slavery it goes straight to a 'Gladiator' ripoff including a Proximo clone. I'm sure they ripped off other films if forgot to mention but it should be clear that originality wasn't a high priority here. Lead actor Lutz goes around topless for 95% of the film so they can show off his pumped up abs and shaved legs (Renny demanded that, hairy legs don't work too well in 3D - seriously). Short of a Braun commercial this was the filmmakers best attempt of getting women into the cinema seats. Those women sure won't be paying attention to the cookie-cutter dialogue, even when delivered with a British accent. In short: Lutz is no Russel Crowe but a cardboard (3D) protagonist. Strangely enough there is no female nudity, only male - so this MUST be a chick flick. The only plus in this pile of three dimensional rubbish is the visuals and the production value. The VFX are nicely done. The costumes, helmets, swords, sandals and sets are quite great to look at considering it was all done for a lowly 70m$. But that's not enough to make a memorable film. If you've seen it once you won't ever feel the urge to see it again.

I suppose the producers thought the action would be the focus, but alas, it fails to excite on so many levels. Yes, there are lots of fighting, but the fighting is marred by excessive use of \"bullet-time\". Someone should tell them bullet-time is good for bullets, and even then, only some bullets. Every time a scene gets exciting or someone is about to get a good smack somewhere, the action slows down. Maybe it's supposed to help you appreciate the kill-blow or choreography, but all it did for me was slow my heart-rate when it should be sped up.The CG effects are mediocre and instead of helping you immerse yourself in the story, it distracts you by letting you wonder what went wrong. The famous Nemean Lion looks like a normal lion - where's the fun it that? And shouldn't an immortal like Hercules have been scripted better action and stunt acts? Even mortal men in movies about mortals have better action and stunt sequences.The dialogue style may be appropriate for a Greek mythological film, but after a while, it sounds contrived. There's no imagination in it - you don't feel for the characters. Instead you get tired of all the macho posturing after some time.The movie does not totally fail though.

It is an epic story of Hercules to growing up from ordinary human to a demi god. It is a story of good and evil, bad stepfather, bad king and betraying brother and it is a love story between Hercules and princess of Crete. I like the way that Renny Harlin can bring a solid story out of the mediocre script. I also like Renny's way to use camera an keep it move all the time. It makes a movie looks more cinematographic and deeper. Too many movies today are too hectic, like music videos and this kind of tranquil filming is more relaxing. It is offence that this movie didn't get theatrical release here in Finland and I was forced to watch it from TV. 3D looks great in the movie and I can only imagine how it would looked in big screen. Choreography of the fighting scenes looks good and speedy. But not so good that there is something bad too. Low age limit of the movie makes all fighting scenes almost bloodless and that eats credibility from fighting scenes. This decision must come from production company more than from director and it is a shame. Maybe they just wanted to get lower age limit to this movie and I'm quite sure that Renny has nothing to do with this decision. Renny also has a ability to get something out even the worst actors. I'm sorry Mr. Lutz, but I think that you are more model than actor. Scott Adkins is convincing as bad king and stepfather, but Liam Garrigan as Iphicles is not very good. There has been a lot of talking about movies CGI and how bad they are, but for me it looks good enough at least when to watch it from TV. The Legend of Hercules works as a family movie quite well, but it's bloodless may exile more adult audience.",

Maybe one day the USA movie industry should think of making some movie that is respectful of the spirit of the stories as well as the fact (here it is very difficult to respect the fact of a mythical figure). I understand that movies cannot be a mirror to reality or myth or books, but when I look at the now quiet long history of movie making and the transforming of history some well documented even of the USA or recent events (like the Western) it has been often an outside movie maker that has told the reality of the story, never a US movie maker!

            "content": "Hollywood turns to Greek mythology for inspiration and comes up with The Legend of Hercules, directed by Renny Harlin and starring Kellan Lutz as the eponymous demigod. As imagined by Harlin and three other credited screenwriters, Hercules is conceived by the king of the gods to deliver his people from the tyranny of the evil King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins). But though Hercules grows up with superhuman strength and skill, only his mother knows he is the son of Zeus. Ironically, Hercules doesn't believe in the gods, and considers his mother's beliefs a waste of time. He prefers to invest his time in the very earthly charms of Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss). But when Hercules sees his beloved ordered to marry Amphitryon's eldest son, the young man rebels, earning himself an exile where the King intends for him to die and be forgotten. Can Hercules reconcile himself to the fact that he is the son of a god and fulfill the heroic destiny his mother imagined for him?The plot isn't half bad, and even if it isn't exactly in line with Greek mythology as recorded it could still be a fine story. But while The Legend of Hercules isn't a failure, it is merely a mixed success of sorts. One of the biggest problems is Hercules himself--or rather, Kellan Lutz. Lutz isn't a good fit for the role at all. He lacks the presence required to play a demigod successfully and frankly is too feminine for a part that requires literally superhuman machismo. And while the general storyline is fine, the script suffers in detail. The dialog is often cheesy and too many plot points are awkwardly realized, as though they were not only written hurriedly but acted and directed on the fly. The script flirts with a certain gravitas near the end, but then throws an opportunity to finish with a real punch away in favor of a more conventional--but far weaker--ending that is virtually inexplicable.On the positive side, some of the rest of the cast is excellent, especially Scott Adkins as Amphitryon. Adkins has been slowly building a formidable reputation among action performers the last several years, and he brings an on screen power to his role as the wicked but mighty King Amphitryon that Lutz simply never matches. It would have been wiser to let Adkins have the starring role as opposed to the younger, more effeminate Lutz. Likewise, Gaia Weiss virtually ignites the screen every time she enters a scene. She's not only almost painfully beautiful, but plays the part of the lovelorn princess with a rare grace and charisma. Production values are fairly good. The ancient setting of mythical Greece is well developed, and the special effects are pretty convincing. There are a lot of violent action scenes, and while blood is kept to a minimum to stay under the PG-13 umbrella there is still plenty of graphic, bone-crunching mayhem. The final battle between Herclues and Amphitryon is quite thrilling, albeit undercut by the aforementioned belly flop that takes the easy way out.To top it off, there is some attempt to explore religious themes in a meaningful way, including several Biblical analogies. The film actually comes across as a pro-faith vehicle and could even be interpreted as at least partly being a Christian allegory, though sometimes only clumsily so.In the end, The Legend of Hercules is entertaining enough for fans of action, science fiction and fantasy, but it's hardly \"legendary\" in any real sense. It's basically a Scy-Fy Original with a bigger budget. That's fine as far as it goes, but while you may have fun watching this movie, you probably won't remember much about it a few hours later.",

No, I am not a hater but that's how it is! :) For the most part, this movie is not to be taken seriously. It's soooooooo loosely based on the name of Hercules. It's a Hercules movie for Hercules sake. It's literally on the same par as Arnold and Sally Field's Hercules in New York.I kept wondering if they rented the costumes from the same company that did 300. Most of the stuff the actors wore didn't even fit (not that they were wearing much). The most prominent one was the helmet.The acting was non existent. It's a great training exercise and get paid. Not a bad deal honestly. A lot of people go to school for that kind of experience. I'd think most of the money was spent on the CGI of the movie, that took probably 90+ percent of the scenes.I like Kellan Luts for being Kellan Luts. You just don't expect much from him. He's eye candy and that's all that matters. He's more watchable than the vampire guys, or the wolves in the vampire movies. Poor guy just needs a big break and he'll be on top of everything.

After seeing the trailer, everyone can pretty much get the idea of what to expect with The Legend of Hercules. I read some very bad reviews before watching, and thanks to that, I can say I was even pleasantly surprised with the film. Of course, the plot is rather simple and predictable, the characters are portrayed black and white, but does that really matter when you buy a ticket for a 3D blockbuster? I believe it doesn't. What matters in such case are the fast-moving plot and the energy it brings. I can say that I really enjoyed it from the very first scene, in which soldiers prepare to attack the fortress of Argos, where I got the short feeling of actual being in the battle. I loved all the special effects, and they are the reason for my high mark. If I hadn't watched it in 3D technique, maybe I wouldn't have liked the film that much, but 3D effects certainly did their job. The magic of the film would probably be lost without them. I just need to make a comment on another issue - illogicality in portraying ancient Greek history that many people discussed here. In my opinion, this is less important. If the director had wanted to teach us history more accurately, he would've probably made a documentary. In conclusion, this is the film for all those who'd like to forget about the outside world for 90 minutes and enjoy the action and illusion history can bring.",

Instead, this story is derivative of all those 60s sword and sandal stories from Italy in which the wronged son of the king has to return to his home and wrest the throne from his evil king/father.The acting is all over the place, as are the accents. Kellan Lutz can't quite cut it as the title character. Other than the muscles he just doesn't come across as Hercules, he is too pretty and his performance lacks believability, though the thin scripting doesn't help. Some of the supporting cast do better, though, again, the script gives them little to work with.The fight scenes go from reasonably exciting to ludicrously laughable. The countless slo-mo leaps through the air, complete with angry shouting, only serve to remind the viewer of the far superior movie 300. The CGI effects are only fair and do not help matters, particularly when Herc is whipping the chains around attached to the pillar blocks and in the final confrontation with the lightning whip effects.I've seen a lot worse, but this is only worth watching if there is nothing else you're even moderately interested in seeing.",

            "content": "I found this movie to be a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood left wing fare we are force fed year after year. The storyline bore almost no resemblance to the mythology of Hercules, but was nonetheless a heroic story of Men being allowed to be men without all the angst and self recrimination prevalent in almost every movie Hollywood produces.One of the highlights of the film is the fact that Hercules embraced his godhood and his father Zeus. He admitted that he did not understand who he really was and when told his father was Zeus, he did not immediately accept it, but eventually came to appreciate what that meant.He is able to accept and use his godhood when needed, but he also embraced his manhood when he fought the final battle as a man with the evil king. It also made for a more action packed movie instead of what it would have been had he struck down the king with a bolt of lightening from above.The only concession to the progressive left was the lone female fighting in the arena, something that would NEVER happen in Greek society, Xena Warrior Princess notwithstanding. Even with that, they did not portray her as this unrealistic superwoman who nearly defeats Hercules. I did fund it interesting that she was the only warrior who was not killed.The bad guys were evil through and through from start to finish, and the good guys were heroic and self sacrificing. There is no moralizing, or preaching, it is a pure action film and should be judged as such.I am not surprised by the number of low ratings given by people who have been raised on movies that portray men as weak, angst ridden, cartoonlike characters, who are subservient to strong women who guide them back to the path of progressive righteousness.If you long for the days when men were portrayed as heroic and strong, both physically and morally, then this is the perfect movie for you.",

This movie does do either!\nIn the myth Hera wants to kill Heracles (sends snakes when he was a baby) here, his birth is her own idea! His father was a fugitive! not a king and he loved Hercules.His brother had a good relationship with him, so good that he followed him in many of his campaigns until he died in one of them. Ivi was a minor goddess of youth, doughter of Zeus and Hera. Nemea's (Nemea is a Territory! he had to GO there) Lion was one of his 12 Labours around Greece and not just a random Lion near his home!. Greeks buried their dead not burn them. \"Sotiris\" (from Sotiria->Salvation) and other names used on this movie are modern Christian names!!! Not ancient Greek names. There were not such underground fights before Romans and Sicily was Greek back then. Romans were not even a thing when Hercules was supposedly around (we are talking about thousants of years apart) so watching \"gladiators\" in a movie about Hercules is SO rediculous. Talos was not the king of Crete!! Talos was a bronze \"Robot\" (an automaton) guarding Crete from side to side. Chiron was a centaur not an old man and he was Achilles tutor/teacher not Hercule's. Even his mother is younger than him in that movie (reminds me the same stupidity in \"Alexander\").

The movie Hercules with Dwayne Johnson (same year) did so much better job! There the myth was MUCH more accurate but with a twist that was very much acceptable, so its not that they messed up historic timelines like in Xena, at least Hercules and Zena from the 90's were fun.

In this version of the story the stepfather of Hercules is a warlord who for reasons left ambiguous needs to be stopped so much that his wife preys to the goddess Hera for a way to stop his reign of terror. The result of said prayer was of course for Hera's husband to impregnate the warlord's queen. Twenty years later the demigod son falls in love with a princess from another kingdom that was prearranged into a marriage with Hercules' half brother. He is sold into slavery because of this and must fight his way back for her and to save Greece from his step-father.This film doesn't stick very closely to the source material as it tells its story. In fact it even at times seems to go out of its way to include more and more clich\u00e9s in some sort of attempt to spice up the drama but ultimately falls flat to deliver an interesting story by doing so. This story takes several moments from other Greek mythological heroes that are not credited to Hercules, and credits them to Hercules! There are times when the script is so all over the place that it feels like you're watching random scenes from different movies. The acting in this movie is somewhere between sub-par and terrible, with the only acceptation being Roxanne McKee who actually managed to deliver in her role as Hercules' mother and made her the single interesting character in the film. Two particularly bad performances were from Kellan Lutz, who played the lead titular character, and Scott Adkins, who played the tyrannical step-father. Scott Adkin's take on the antagonist he is portraying is to utter every single line of his dialogue with either shouting or growling, which makes his character come across as laughably cartoony as best. The lead actor of this film, Kellan Lutz, is wooden, dull, and fails on every single dimension to bring any kind of presence to the epic character he is playing. The special effects for this film were on occasion fun and held up exceptionally well compared to some independent Youtube videos. However, at a budget of seventy million dollars the CGI was unacceptably cheap looking and blatantly intended for 3D effects, with the occasional effect taken straight from the five-year-old's play book of sword-under-the-arm technology (which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't the armpit on the camera's side). The far too short fight sequences utilized a special effect taken straight from 300 where the camera slightly zooms in and goes to slow motion just before an attack connects. This effect worked in 300 because to choreography was centred around that aspect, whereas here it's haphazardly thrown in and seems very out of place and overused.The soundtrack to this film is by far its most redeeming quality. The tracks were kept simple but effective with this ambiance of an epic tale unfolding in front of you. The composer to these songs was very clearly inspired by the source material of the film and created one of the best sword and sandal film scores I've ever heard.Ultimately, my opinion comes down to this: Buy or listen to the soundtrack, skip the film. Kellan Lutz has shown me that he would be far more qualified to play the lead in an underwear commercial than he would be in another major motion picture. I watched this film twice, the first time I admit I was amused by it because of the banter between myself and those I witnessed it with. Because of this I thought the movie was merely mediocre. The second time however I did so alone and was able to truly experience what it had to offer. It sounds great, but it also looks bad, it's acted poorly, It's uninteresting, uninspired, boring, clich\u00e9, and hard to sit through.",

Fan fiction at its worst. This movie quickly devolves into a comedy.We see remnants of Alexander's conquest of Egypt centuries too early, an acropolis before it was built (shown as a kings palace), a vibrant culture in Sicily during a period that it had no more than 3 inhabitants, gladiator games at LEAST 1500 years too soon, Romans cheering for Hercules before Rome existed, a cockney accent, and a hairstyle designed by Coolio in the 1990's. And poor Hera, the queen of the gods, appears looking like a whiny crack whore. We could have gotten drunk and written a better story on a white board. The only upside to this movie is that there was a worse movie made its year. It was deservedly nominated for, but lost the Golden Razzie award for Worst Picture of the year to Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas. So, congratulations?",

Maybe I was waiting too much of this movie. The movie doesn't justify the budget. The CGI was awful. Matrix (a movie that was filmed 15 years ago) has better special effects and CGIs.

Anyhow this movie has everything you need to make a bad movie l, bad cinematography , crappy directing, trashy set ups, bad editing, terrible acting, atrociously awful script and story writing this movie is an abomination, nothing in this movie was good action movies by any genre are supposed to be made for entertainment and this has none of it i was bored the whole time I was watching this pile of dung, watching the clock malfunction would be far more entertaining than this, avoid This one at all costs",

First i would sue the scriptwriters for the unbelievably cringe worthy love dialogue which i think was taken from a\" auto random love dialogue generator webpage\". then i would sue the editors for placing the slow motion fight scenes ripped off by 300 and then overused every 10 seconds for insignificant fight scenes. then i would sue for copywrite infringement because it seems they used the famous 300 line in spirit to \"take everything from them\" meaning they took everything from 300 and everything from gladiator and left nothing for originality.This movie had nothing to do with Hercules in mythology other than the name.

When they landed in Egypt, I was hoping, expecting a giant scorpion or something to pop up, alas no, just boring, not scary or intimidating men in plastic costumes. The laughable boring plot. The times they actually showed something supernatural, they could have saved their money, it looked like a grade school science project. They ignored the good parts of the story of Hercules, watered down and completely messed up the story of Hercules. They should have decided to make a movie about gladiators with no magic/God's or special powers or went all out on special effects/monsters. Instead we get a half boring gladiator/crappy magical movie. I could go on and on but that's my 2 cents.",

Well actually I do not think there was any mythological accuracies, except that Herc kills the Nimeanan Lion, but not even in the right way. Historically it is even worse, the only historical aspect that is right is that their buildings were not all white marble they were actually painted mostly red, this is accurate with the time period. The soldiers' armor on the other hand seems to be a cross of Golden Age Spartan and Roman Empire armor, placed on soldiers that were supposed to have lived prior to or in the Bronze Age. A majority of the men were riding horses into battle, something the Greeks would not be doing, or at least not all the men on horses, because stirrups were about 1500 years in the making, rendering horses ineffective. I could go on for days on the inaccuracies and horrible movie making, but I will spare the trouble.

Everyone always focuses on his powers and gifts from his Greek father who is a god and expects him to go around slaughtering the town, beating up all the baddies, and advancing his prowess and legends. Maybe there was more to Hercules. Dare I say he had the feelings and emotions of a mortal man, that he had a true love and was consumed by his feelings for her. That he would be a good man who would do what was right and stand up for justice, and just maybe in those times of need he drew upon something that was more than he realized he had. Does there need to be magic and awe in every line, in every paragraph.I know nothing of this director and I don't try to be a witty reviewer or big philosophical critic of movies. I do know that in this version of Hercules, I saw a real hero who was just a man, yet more, and I could more readily believe that this version of Hercules existed than the mythical legend most of society believes in.For those of you who haven't seen it, you have to go into it with an open mind.

But this is a fine example of how sometimes the standard can drop a bit. Kellan Lutz comes right out of the Twilight series and into yet another bad career choice. He is a pretty bad actor in this, not terrible or at the low level of Tommy Wiseau or anyone similar. Undeniably bad though, just like the whole cast. Scott Adkins is by far the worst as arguably the most clich\u00e9d and painful to watch movie villain of all time King Amphitryon. Every single sentence he says is overly dramatic and in a deep raspy voice. You have got to give the cast a tiny bit of credit though, because some of the dialogue they are working with is incredibly cheesy. There are one or two genuinely cool lines dotted about the predictable plot, but not enough to redeem the bad ones. Just by looking at the trailer you could tell this was going to be a wannabe 300, just like Immortals, full of dumb brainless slow motion shots which didn't even work in 300 for gods sake. Every punch thrown or kick kicked is clumsy and gives the fight sequences that movie ruining thing: a crash bang wallop feel. You might be wondering what that means. I'm basically saying the action scenes have no intelligence or talent in them whatsoever. The worst thing about this whole goddamn punch fest of a movie though is undoubtedly the sex scenes. One of the first things you see in the movie is a woman being impregnated by Zeus (who is of course not actually there) and it is executed so badly and performed so terribly you won't even believe your eyes. Or regrettably your ears, if you know what I mean.The Legend of Hercules is shoddily written and acted, only a fool would enjoy this almost instantly forgettable but not boring money maker.

Capture the Erymanthian Boar. Clean the Augean stables in a single day. Slay the Stymphalian Birds. Capture the Cretan Bull. Steal the Mares of Diomedes. Obtain the girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Obtain the cattle of the monster Geryon. Steal the apples of the Hesperides. Capture and bring back Cerberus.Cool huh??? not like the movie indeed - who the F*** cares about the stupid, cheesy bullshit princess???? ...the box office I guess 80% of the population of the states doesn't even know where Greece is but they pay for love-crap don't they?",

            "content": "Poor reviews almost forced me to choose not to view this movie until it made its inevitable debut on Netflix. When my discount movie theater offered it, I decided to give it a watch. I'm glad I did. This was good movie and I wouldn't have felt cheated had I paid the full price of admission.I have to give the disclaimer that if you enter the theater looking for epic battles against intimidating odds or an epic boss fight, you'd be wise to look elsewhere. While the film makes an attempt at presenting 'baddies' the greatest sense of apprehension you feel is that characters will be lost to each other, not necessarily taken by some fate of a cruel ancient world. While the above may seem merely semantic, this is a finer nuance of the film viewers would do well to keep in mind as they watch.The Legend of Hercules was a movie that attempted to be a romantic action-adventure. I stress romantic first because my impression of the movie is the directors focused more on the romantic relationships of its characters rather than building up the tyranny of the king, his would be predecessor or any other subsequent foe. For adrenaline junkies, this would be a buzz kill. For me, I figure they expected the Hercules film starring the Rock to encompass that sort of storyline and attempted to be distinct.I left the theater satisfied by the direction and acting in this film. I remain confused as to why there was so much negativity about the film. I figure people were disappointed because they THOUGHT the film should have been a showcase of action and adventure when those things were merely secondary to the quest for love. As a parting note, I must say Weiss is STUNNING. One look at her and you'll realize the logic behind crafting the film around a tireless desire to be at her side rather than wondering the globe in search of endless quests to test one's mettle.",

Kellan Lutz is likable in the lead role but he's about as Greek as Gold's Gym. Overall, it's a bit of a mash-up of other films, most obviously Gladiator. In particular, the character of Hercules' evil half-brother apes the performance of Joaquin Phoenix, and Kenneth Cranham (Shine On Harvey Moon - that dates me) must have been told to channel Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner. I liked some of the minor characters, especially a priestess possessed by a god (Mariah Gale as Tiresias presumably, I started getting lost with the Greek names) and sometimes the CGI works to good effect. More often than not though, the crowd scenes look like a poorly-rendered video game and the romantic trysts, excerpts from The Blue Lagoon (a 1980 erotic film). I found it frequently lost credibility, usually because of the mixture of accents (East End London, Australian...) and lush forest scenes filmed in Bulgaria. It looked and sounded like Robin of Sherwood and Street Fighter, rather than an epic tale of Greco-Roman mythology.",

It was not the worst movie I have watched but I did find many faults.There did not seem to be a flow in the movie and scenes were not long enough for the most part. Then there were the scenes that were too long. The fight scenes were quite disappointing, especially where Hercules fights 6 who have never lost a fight before to gain freedom for himself and Sotiris. If you blinked you would have missed watching Hercules killing the 5 men and pinning down the woman. That is how quickly this scene was over.The final fight between King Amphitryon and Hercules was brilliant and almost worth watching all of the movie before it.I do feel that this movie does rate between 4 or 5 stars and that might be a bit too much. It is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.Renny Harlin directed this movie and I looked at some of his past movies and he seems to make pretty much the same quality of movies as this one. I am truly stumped as to why he was given a 70 million dollar budgeted movie. The acting was quite poor for most of the actors but not all can be blamed on the actors when the writing was poor as well.

            "content": "This movie was one of the largest piles of craps in the year of 2014. Let's start with the most glaring of these mistakes.The lack of characterization and development makes this movie bland a boring. We're given a large number of stock characters as the main characters, told to care about their plots and that's about it. The Jealous tyrant, the envious older sibling, the soldier/family man, the old mentor, and the list goes on. Other than the brother, we are offered no characterization beyond this, and the brother offers minimal characterization at most. At multiple times, he looks as though he regrets his actions but it is never expanded on and then forgotten.No suspense. Never once was the abilities of the main character called into question. Never once did he go into a fight with the audience on the edge of their seats wondering how he will survive this fight or if he had the guts to take on his newest opponent. Hercules goes into every fight either completely dominating his opponent or getting captured. Never once in the entire movie was he given a fight that reduced him to running on fumes, winning only at the last second by a miracle burst of adrenaline. True, he is a demigod and thus the normal rules don't apply to him but what fun is a character the never gets tired, never allows injuries to affect him, or never calls into question his own strength.The third and final thing I will put is the god-awful script. Ignoring the lack of characterization, let's look at other things. The forced dialogue where it exists makes it hard to focus on the movie and the action scene were boring, at best. The romance was horribly drawn out and forced, giving no real sense of connection between Hercules and whoever it was he romanced (see completely forgettable). Besides being told repeatedly they are in love, we are given nothing these two bond over. The movie is also filled with so many clich\u00e9s my hand would cramp up before I finished writing them all.",

The simple fact that it was rated higher on average than Hercules tells me to look elsewhere for reviews of movies I haven't seen. Obviously, the Hoi Polloi of reviewers on this site wouldn't know what a good movie was if it slapped them across the face.A good comedy would be something like The Hangover, or 21 Jump Street, maybe Superbad. Or if you want to think while you are watching comedies, try one of those older Clerks/Clerks2/Mallrats/Jay and Silent Bob Movies.

Maybe this should have been called The Disaster of Hercules.Renny Harlin should take some directing lessons from Ridley Scott and Peter Jackson because he cannot shoot an epic film. The movie could have easily been made into a television series and I think if it were, Harlin would have payed more attention to detail and the storyline because he would've had more time to shoot each scene in depth. Also maybe would've thought twice before hiring Kellan Lutz as Hercules.",

The acting is wooden and the cast a load of nobody z listers (if that)-Hercules himself looks like he's spent more time waxing his chest and whitening his teeth than he has on his acting career, the plot doesn't flow and is utterly un-engaging, the props and costumes look cheap, it screams 'low budget' and the special effects and cgi had my partner and I laughing. I wanted to switch it off with in two minutes of it starting. 'Just keep watching, it might get better' my partner said, at which point the most ridiculous excuse of a cgi lion comes lumbering out woodenly, taking technology back a few decades. The timing was rather amusing but it was the final straw. I just can't believe the producers of this film thought it would be OK to release something so ridiculous.",

It would be to much to ask for them to do a historical research cause Hercules mini skirt would not give much for imagination. And can they run a bit faster cause they were pretty slow in everything, running, fighting... And the age difference, Hercules seems like he was the same age as his mother and father and the brother looked older then all of them together. OK so people if you want to see this movie go ahead but please do something more productive with your time, like I don't know, learn how to knit",

            "content": "The myth of Hercules is one with many versions even in ancient Greece since many cannot seem to agree exactly what this hero did and like to add their tales. Movies and TV series have also thrown their own versions in and made this legend a very full pot of which one can choose many story lines and run them. With so many choices for the Greek hero, it is very hard to believe that the best the producers could come up with was a \"Gladiator-Hercules\".This movie was a bad imitation of 300 and the \"Titans\" movies, full with the slow motion action fight scenes and the ridiculous gymnastic leaps that no self-respecting soldier would ever attempt since he would probably end up skewered before he even landed.The historical and mythological aspects were completely inaccurate and full of anachronisms since the \"Colosseum style, Gladiator fights\" was something that became a habit during the Roman Republic, more than a millennium after Hercules' time. The clothing and armour were also more Roman than Ancient Greek, and bad imitations at that too. And despite all that, the worst of all may have been the dialogs that seemed more Shakespearean than anything that has to do with ancient Greece.Still this could have worked anyway if the story and the acting was anything worth watching but that wasn't the case. The story was overly rushed at some points and too slow at others and way too romance-focused for it to work in the Fantasy/Action genre. Kellan Lutz, while very good eye-candy, has very poor acting abilities and would have been much better suited for an underwear model than an actor, I'm not usually overly critical of acting(because what do I know?) but playing a mostly tragic character and smirking the whole time just doesn't work. McIntyre and Weiss while marginally better, still failed to impress. The one good surprise came with McKee who gave a very good performance and if she had more screen time could have well made the movie watchable.The battle scenes and visual effects were equally laughable and badly done.The end result is a mess of a movie that I watched half on fast- forward. Luckily the Ratner version of Hercules was much better done.",

I was drawn into the plot from the very beginning, although I would have preferred a little more mythology in the movie, but then again it focused on Hercules at a younger age. I really enjoyed the whole movie and am not sure why it has so many poor reviews. It has great actors and has a plot beyond the blood and fighting (which is all the other version has). Definitely worth watching! If you weren't thrilled with the other version, give this one a try. The chemistry between the two leading actors is great and I thought Kellen was a perfect Hercules. I almost did not recognize him (from Twilight) in this movie. He is a great leading actor and this movie has not been given the credit it deserves. The set and scenery was actually believable for the most part, especially compared to other movies which are mostly CGI. The other 2014 Hercules is basically a '300'ish adaptation, if that's you're thing then watch that one, but if you want a movie with real characters beyond the fighting and a plot, then this movie is the clear winner!",

This movie makes a mockery of the story of Hercules that we all know so well. It brings to life NOTHING familiar from the mythological tale.Whats disappointing is that they made the movie so cheesy. The acting was sloppy, the dialogs overdone and music, well, cheesier still. Throughout the movie I waited eagerly for Hercules to hit his stride and finally embrace his Zeus-ness.

The movies editor obviously had no idea what he was doing, it seems that the producer was presented with horrible options and chose the absolute worst choices out of many, and the director probably just showed up on set to receive credit in a movie that (much to my dismay) went to theaters for a while. The special effects (which wouldn't be fit for even the 'land of the lost' series) were terrible. The scene with the nemean lion made you want to walk out and demand a refund if you had not already done so after the first two scenes.
