            "review_title": "Hirani takes innovation and creative thinking to a different level",
            "content": "While entering the theater, I was excited and so were many people in my vicinity. Being a Rajkumar Hirani flick, one can hardly expect disappointing but you never really know. After 3 idiots in 2009, it took Hirani a hiatus of five years to come up with PK. But does this deliver enough to live up to its promise? Well, I feel proud to say this, Hirani has not let us down. Aamir Khan this time in PK has left no stone unturned and has put in his best for his role. From his physique to his language, the actor is simply brilliant. Indulging himself in a role of an innocent outsider(the role which suits Aamir perfectly), he speaks more with his expressions than any of the actors do with their words. With Aamir on the frontier, it is hardly fair game for the remnant of the crew to show their finesse. Quite to the contrary, Anushka plays an adequately important role in doing her best to ameliorate the humour. Sanjay Dutt who appears in parts is also fabulous. Now, the screenplay. Magnificent. Every dialogue and the successive is written, furnished and polished with extreme care and prowess. Music by Ankit Tiwari does not differ from the director's previous movies, they are quite decent and go hand in hand with the plot. I went to the theater excited and came out learning something. PK is a movie which entertains you every minute with its creativity in successfully creating an atmosphere of humour and exuberance. PK is out to provoke but not to shock. The film asks questions via its idiot savant protagonist, but does not attempt to deliver facile, absolute answers. And that makes it all the more effective. PK is an adventure which will make you laugh heartily, make you feel heart rended and make you learn to let go, simultaneously promulgating a message. PK is something i would describe, as an emotional roller-coaster. PK is an experience of a life time.If you have people with orthodox thinking in your proximity or people who are led to blind beliefs of religious drama or are puritanical, PK is just the movie for them. For others, this goes without saying, a must watch.My rating - \"An emotional masterpiece\" Traditional rating - 9.5/10.",

            "review_title": "P.assed with first K.ilass",
            "content": "Director Mr. Raj Kumar Hirani have different sensibilities, which he proved again. His style of depiction of a serious subject on a light note with humor toppings are again delicious. I love, respect and support this subject so there would be changes of being little positively biased. This is a very good extension of one of my favorite flick \"Oh My God\". That one was of single plot but PK is multi plotted. Story is just to support and explore the basic idea of film but it's interesting. Screenplay by Director himself and Abhijit Joshi is fresh, logical and different even being very close to \"Oh My God\". Dialogues by director and writer duo are perfect and logical. In a scene, where Amir Khan is emotionally broken then blast in the background enhances the intensity and carry forward the story ahead very smoothly. The use of old song in a very light note or serious note is also interesting especially \"Pardesi Pardesi Jana Nahi\" in beginning and \"Aasman Mein Hai Khuda Aur Zameein par Hum\" in between the film, is good tribute and use of songs. Now this type of film must have been made to rebel the business of fear. We should change our lifestyle by not being God fearing but becoming God loving. Hope such type of films will make changes even a little. Love is a side track but it's very good and emotional with a message too. I personally feel that after a long gap this movie has repeat value. Performance wise Hats off to Amir Khan. He is absolute perfect and first time I witnessed him, doing fantastic in emotional scenes too. He needs extra praising for always choosing something different subject with a message too. Anushka Sharma is fantastic. Her look is different and expressions are very real. Sanjay Dutt is endearing. Shaurav Shukla and Parikshat Sahni are very good. Sushant Singh Rajput is fine. Boman Irani is impressive. Music is melodious, lyrics are perfect. Both gel with the mood and subject of the film very well.",

Once you watch the movie for yourself you might agree with me, that the movie delivers on what it has to offer.",

            "review_title": "Wow - I was not expecting this.",
            "content": "This is a comedy about a guy who is naked in the middle of nowhere in a desert along some railroad tracks with nothing but a boom-box who is struggling, like so many of us do, with the failed promises of religion. All he wants ... is his remote back. I am a huge Aamir Khan fan and I loved 3 Idiots. In fact, I have the love song Zoobie Doobie as my ring tone. So - as soon as they announced this movie - I knew I wanted to see it. The marketing campaign only peaked my interest more. Why is Aamir naked in the middle of the desert with a boom-box? This is the question even my son was asking. Why? Who is his character. Then - they put out the posters - and - who the heck is this PK character.Well - let me just say - I had no idea that this was going to be the plot. Wow. Let's start with the disclaimer - we don't intend to offend anyone's religion. I'm thinking - OK - I wonder what that's all about. Well, that disclaimer has to go down in history as one of the biggest understatements in all of film history.Then the opening sequence. And, I'm thinking - wow - this is REALLY a) mind blowing and b) humanistic. Being a Humanist, I loved it - but it seemed a bit extreme for an Indian movie given that India is such a religious country. Having such a science based opening with the philosophy that goes with it - was a bit shocking. I loved it, but it was totally unexpected because it was so expansive.The foundation of this film is the struggle of someone to come to terms with the failed promises of religion. And it's REALLY funny. I saw it in a nearly sold out theater in America and people were applauding some of the most pointed critiques of religious practice - not because they were anti-religious - but because it was pro-human. There are some really funny moments in this movie, like Aamir trying to bring wine into a mosque had the entire audience laughing. Again, not because it was making fun of Muslims, but because of how clueless the character PK is. It's also heartbreaking - stunningly so. And as I've been digesting this movie over the past day or so - I realize that the artistic choices to break our hearts in the way this movie does - was incredibly well done. It's so sudden and unexpected that it's perfect for the story line and the social point they are making. Even the ending is really astonishing. Aamir is just staring at a shoe in his hand, and yet, what is happening around him is creating so much tension. And you know how it's going to end, but that doesn't make you any less tense hoping that it will end how you want it to. They built the tension up and released it perfectly and Aamir's performance, as understated as it was - because he was just looking at a shoe, was amazing. I was shocked by this film, but in a really good way. If you are a Humanist, you really need to see this film. If you are religious, but frustrated with the con men speaking on behalf of your faith - see this film. You won't be disappointed. As someone said as I passed by - it's about time someone said what we have all been thinking.",

            "content": "Till yesterday, the benchmark for the best Hindi movie was 3 Idiots. But after watching PK, I would say that the benchmark should be changed. The same team that brought 3 Idiots has brought another magnificent movie. Everyone in the movie acted exceptionally well. The manner in which the social issues are depicted is very good. If we see the comedy aspects alone, 3 idiots is better. But if we see the social issues taken, PK is far better than the other movie. This is Aamir's best performance till date. Ranbir Kapoor comes in a comical guest role. Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput and Saurabh Shukla are the other main characters.Overall rating- 9.5/10",

A film that is funny, at times hilarious, but lastly, is a film about finding truth within ourselves. Its a powerful film, that left me astonished!'P.K' Synopsis: An alien stuck on earth, gets help from a budding TV-anchor, and later learns about Religion & a fear named God.'P.K' raises questions upon God, God-Men & Religion. I'm an atheist & I could connect with the protagonist's fight against the \"almighty\" to a great extent. The film has moral as well as a terrific message, that will leave this godly world we live in, rather stunned. Hirani's story offers moments of pure hilarity, subtle romance, tuneful songs & hard-hitting drama.Hirani's Screenplay is excellent. P.K's journey on earth, will leave you in splits. His voice against the God-Men, are clap-worthy, while his Romance with his human girlfriend, is cute. What's truly funny, is that, P.K, an alien, looks far more sorted & normal in comparison to the human characters. And that's Hirani's genius! He delivers a story about our fears & flaws & he executes it, remarkably well.Hirani's Direction is simple, yet effective. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Music by Various Artists is tuneful. Visual Effects are decent. Make-Up is nicely done. Performance-Wise: Aamir's portrayal of 'P.K', is simply astounding! He delivers a moving, heartfelt performance, that touches the core of your heart. He carries the film on his board shoulders & steals the show. His finest performance to date! Anushka Sharma is lovely. Also, Her on-screen chemistry with Aamir, is adorable. Sanjay Dutt is lovable in a cameo. Sushant Singh Rajput, also, shines in a brief role. Saurabh Shukla is incredible as the God-Man. His scenes with Aamir, are captivating. Boman Irani is first-rate, as always. Parikshet Sahani is wonderful. Ranbir Kapoor makes an amazing appearance. On the whole, 'P.K' has its heart, mind & soul, at the right place! Grab A Ticket Now!",

Not only Aamir, but Anushka Sharma and Sanjay Dutt did a very good job of their character which I think no one could have done. Sushant Rajput also did a fine job of his character.Like everything in this film is perfect. I insist you to go and enjoy the film because it's like a word of mouth movie.

            "content": "'PK' is latest offering from blockbuster duo of Aamir Khan and Rahkumar Hirani. They deliver first 200 cr film '3 Idiots' and this time expectations are for 300 cr. Let's see whether they manage to achieve that. Film has rather interetsing plot. Alien PK (Aamir Khan) lands in Rajasthan and he lost his connection with spaceship and so he tries to survive on earth on his own. But his mannerism and thirst for knowledge of this new planet result in questioning of basic premises of religions. Though this sounds similar to 'Oh My God!' but that was more entertaining and here the treatment is more serious. In middle of this journey he meets good friend Bhairao Singh (Sanjay Dutt), Jaggu (Anushka Sharma). Jaggu is a student from Belgium but her role is half baked though that looks deliberate. In the end how PK manages touch upon some relevant issues and leaves a mark form the climax of the film. Performance wise Aamir Khan is simply outstanding and his methodical acting in every frame is commendable. He never goes out of character and his emotional impact is superb in climax. Anushka Sharma again gets 'Jab Tak Hai Jaan' kind of character which is catalyst but not a typical actress role. She manages to make a mark despite half baked role and presence of Aamir. Sushant Singh Rajput looks like a star and even in brief role he is too good. Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla get very little to do and Sanjay Dutt is decent.Film has some real boring songs and all songs work as welcome break in the film. Editing is uneven and cinematography is decent. Background score is good. Story and screenplay are so tight that they manage to hold the film together throughout despite flaws. Dialogues are strictly average and at times Bhojpuri dialect looks out of the place. Art department and costume department are below par. Director Rajkumar Hirani again makes an entertaining social film where he raises few important points in right manner but this time impact is no where clsoe to his best work 'Lage Raho Munnabhai'. Film tries hard but then that should not be visible. Because it is releasing after 'Oh My God', the novelty goes away to some extent. Film will release today and will get 4000 screens which will be apt for such film. Film will do roaring business in multiplexes for sure but will single screen audience embrace this content remains the question. Still a big hit is on the card for sure but how big is the million dollar question!Go for this one for right medley of entertainment and message!Pluses: Aamir Khan excels once again with his methodical approach, Aushka Sharma looks fresh, Sushant Singh Rajput is scene stealer, Sanjay Dutt is average, Saurabh Shukla and Boman Irani remain underutilized, excellent screenplay Minuses: below par dialogues, boring music, uneven editing especially in 2nd halfVerdict: Watch it for perfect script and stellar performances",

Whoever wrote this story had given it much thought on the basic idea as it was thought provoking and tries to shatter the root of evil in our religious society. But the upper layers of the story were like any other Indian movie, with same emotional drama in awkward places, a love story, an evil guy who gets ridiculed, etc. Thus the movie couldn't get too deep. It couldn't deliver to its full potential, but at any moment in the story I didn't feel bored. Songs are right on spot and creates a good mood. The movie also makes you realize how colorful, beautiful yet complex Indian society is. If you liked the movie Oh my god! then I am sure you would like this too. Worth a watch anyway.",

Meanwhile in Burges, Belgium, the Indian student of television production Jagat \"Jaggu\" Janani (Anushka Sharma) meets the Pakistani student Sarfraz Yousuf (Sushant Singh Rajput) and they immediately fall in love with each other. When Jaggu tells her family about Sarfraz, her father consults his guru Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla) that tells that Sarfraz will leave her. Jaggu and Sarfraz decide to get married but while waiting for him in the temple, a boy delivers a letter to her telling that he will not marry her due to their different religions. Jaggu returns to India and works in a television network. When Jaggu meets the naive PK, he tells his journey to her and his search for God to retrieve his remote control but she does not believe in his words. But soon she realizes that he is an alien and is telling the truth. When PK discovers that Tapasvi has his remote control and claims that it belonged to God, PK tells that he is dialing the wrong number to God and giving wrong advices to his followers. Jaggu decides to use PK in a show to expose the guru and retrieve his remote control. But PK falls in unrequited love with her. What will happen to PK and Jaggu? \"PK\" is another great Indian film, with a funny and touching story of innocence, friendship and love. PK asks innocent questions that disarm his opponents and make them think. Further, is a powerful criticism to charlatans and false religious leaders that manipulate their followers to take their money. Sushant Singh Rajput is hilarious in the role of the naive PK and Anushka Sharma has a great chemistry with him. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",

Not knowing the language, the people, PK has a tough time but he eventually finds a good friend in the form of Bhairav Singh (sanjay dutt). Few incidents occur and PK finds himself in Delhi in his search for tracker device. He is helped by Jagat Janani (anushka) in his search. What happens after that forms the rest.The director has come up with a unusual storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was quite absorbing. The dialogues were well written. The script was above average and the screenplay made it lot better. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was majestic. Aamir Khan has given a stellar performance and he stole the show, easily one of his career bests. Anushka Sharma was competent and did her best. Sanjay Dutt was superb. Saurabh Shukla and Boman Irani were not used to their fullest. Sushant Singh was effective. Others did their bit as required and added value.The basic crux of the plot is quite interesting and it was a take on few beliefs of our society that have existed since centuries. While it has been blended with some satire, some humor and some emotion, there was some slack in energy. The first half goes about with elements of comedy, some interesting moments and the interval bang was interesting. The second half slows down a bit and takes the fizz away but it has its own share of bright moments, but predictability seeps in . Overall, this film seems to have an Oh My God, hangover as its story is quite similar. This is probably one of RKH weakest films, but thats saying a lot because the film is still great. Expectations where high and the films 1st half meet those expectations the film seemed humorous and pathbreaking, but the 2nd half syndrome does sep in. But still this film is a must watch for the films overall, message against how religious and some society norms are ridiculous, and for aamir's performance.3.5/5* or 7/10",

All the promos were intriguing & made me watch the film. And as usual Rajkumar Hirani & Aamir Khan didn't disappoint me. Rather i got more than what i expected. Started off with a Simple Love story between Anushka & Sushant Singh Rajput which could look a li'l dull at times. But it picked up nicely ever since Aamir Khan got into the frame. There are Laughter riots throughout the 1st half. The song 'Bhagwan..' was Picturised amazingly. The song sang by Sonu Nigam left me with moist eyes. But the main focus of the film was to put light on our way of thinking about the Godmen. 'PK' takes this message a few steps higher than what we saw in Paresh Rawal starrer 'Oh My God'. It also brightened the focus on people's point-of-view towards different Religions. The 1st half was full of pace and some memorable scenes. 2nd half started off a little slowly with a couple of stretched scenes (that had no need of). But it again picked up pace and headed towards the Climax with lots more drama, laughter and excitement. For me, it's one of the Best executed films i have seen recently. One of the Best fims of 2014 for sure (along with the likes of 'Haider' & 'Queen') if not the Best. It's also a very timely released film as the devastating terror attack took place in Pakistan a few days back. Talking about the acting, Aamir Khan has just Killed it once again. I can't recall when is the last time I came across such a brilliant performance in bollywood. His Acting, his expressions, his style - everything was just beautiful. Arguably his Best Ever Performance. Anushka Sharma, playing a TV Journalist has also done a commendable job. Sourabh Shukla looked extra- ordinary in his Bald look. he was awesome as usual. Sunshat & Boman were good in their respective small roles. PK is a Trademark Rajkumar Hirani Film written all over it with Laughter, Emotions, Drama & an important Message. I would Love if the whole Bollywood starts making films like Raju Hirani without caring about Box Office Records as Baba Ranchoddas says, \"Chase Excellence, success will follow you\" ;) & lastly, if you are a Bollywood lover, then you'll have a huge Surprise at the End of the Film. :)",

The year 2014 has surely ended with a SMASH HIT. I was disappointed with Aamir after Dhoom 3 and I guess I am not alone but this movie makes up for everything, every darn thing. It is not Aamir's best performance but would surely count as one of his best. What makes it so bloody brilliant is the story which takes some pretty serious subject matters and portrays them to the audience in a way that the audience can only laugh, and when in the serious scenes, they do not laugh, what they do is reflect over what happened and THINK and the obvious BRILLIANT direction by Rajkumar Hirani. This movie makes you THINK. PK caters to both the types of audiences, one who just want uninhibited CRAZINESS and just want to ENJOY their time while they watch a movie, and the other, who want the movie to make sense and make you think, they want to learn something from it. THIS MOVIE CATERS TO BOTH!! Sushant Singh Rajput was used adequately in the movie, some might feel his role was small but I don't think so. Sanjay Dutt does justice to his role too. Boman Irani had a small role, smaller than that of Sanjay Dutt's. Anushka Sharma was pretty okay. Nothing great or spectacular. Oh and, watch out for that SURPRISE at the end of the movie!! PLEASE GO AND WATCH, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!",

As is common, this is someone from outer space who gets puzzled by our obsession with religion. It has to be this kind of outsider because no place on the planet seems to have escaped. This element of the film is unrewarding. The shots are of the cheapest kind, targeting plain fakes. He could have easily gone deeper but then it wouldn't be a funny dancing movie.

The moment I saw the plot becoming real within the first 10 minutes, I was skeptical whether I will like this movie. But to my surprise Aamir Khan blew me away with his incomparable acting skills and cuteness of the character. He will make you feel as if you are looking at a child who has been introduced in the world for the first time but has a consciousnesses. The main subject of the movie or so to say the \"Strong Message\", has been adapted by many movies before but PK stands far out from any of them. This movie will make you laugh but also make you cry.

The uniqueness of Raju Hirani lies in making a pertinent point on the social fabric of the country n yes ensure relentless entertainment. Hirani touches our heart and mind at the same time. Yet again. Raju Hirani, you short little genius !!. Anushka Sharma springs a refreshing surprise.She shines brilliantly as an actress. Sushant Singh Rajput is extremely endearing in a cameo while Sanjay Dutt is all heart...The fat barber will emerge as a Rock star soon. If you're looking for a rare experience of emotion packed message n quality entertainment then #PK won't disappoint you.Enjoy Its truly your best performance till date!!!

Lagaan and 3 Idiots are miles ahead in terms of his performance.The movie boasts of some really good scenes. And yes, I enjoyed it in parts.

There was nothing in the movie which touched by heart as a whole unlike other films of Rajkumar Hirani which kept me thinking about it even after going out of the movie theater.There were some scenes which were irritating and not even funny and were just put to show the whole world of why Aamir khan is such a great actor.The songs were like children's poem.I just want to tell everyone that don't blindly appreciate whatever he does,he is not always right and perfect.If this movie was made with a new comer it surely would have bombed at the box office.The movie didn't have a particular story to keep you edged at the seats,things just kept happening with a few laughs here and there.There are so much better movies made which don't get that appreciation because of the small star cast and low marketing.",

I asked myself, \"what is this?\" So, I read the description of the film, and a description never gives away much of the film, but I said I have to see this one, I don't understand what its about nor is it in my language, but I have to see it--perfect, this is the film I want to see--lets take a chance tonight. I really didn't want to go see mainstream film (that would be the first thing in theaters that's playing)--how boring. So, I decided to go see this film. I believe that night I was the only non-Indian present inside the theater. Let me tell you, I was meant to be there that night. It was a divine appointment. It was as if GOD Himself said to me, \"I love you--it's going to be alright\". The more I watched, the more I laughed and cried. It was all in subtitles, but this film was a BIG BLESSING for my life that night, and continues to be. This film became very personal for me. Everything that was discussed, everything that was addressed, I just felt in my heart to be true. BIG important questions asked in this film. I was out of my comfort zone, and I was loving every second of it. To the crew that thought, wrote, and made this film--I applaud you.

            "content": "\"Pk\" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year, may be for Aamir Khan, Raj Kumar Hirani, or the promising promos of the film. The film tries to see the world through the eyes of an alien who has no idea of what the life in the earth is like. Through this character the film tries to make a satire to different religions and the stubbornness of the religions and the god men (managers of the god as described in the movie). In the aspect, the subject doesn't come strongly than Paresh Rawal's \"OMG: Oh My God\" in which the debate on the existence of god and religions was stronger and interesting. Anyway, the questions put in the first half and the representation of different religions are pretty witty and hold the audiences to the edge of their seats.However, the film doesn't stick to a single issue and delves much into the melodrama which makes it a light entertaining movie than a strong social issue based movie. On a whole. the film appears an amalgam of many popular movies like \"3 Idiots,\"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" or \"OMG.\" However, the alien as a protagonist and the way he deals and asks the simple questions on basic truths of life make this film entertaining and novel. Overall, Aamir Khan steals the show. Anushka Sharma, Saurabh Sukla, Parikshit Sahni also deliver good performances. Direction of Raj Kumar Hirani is similar to \"3 Idiots\": entertaining and hilarious but with not very memorable characters like in \"3 Idiots,\" except \"Pk\" himself.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",

One more scene where Aamir fought with a man which was in God shankar get up. These were all in regard to controversies now question is whether this film delivers? The answer is a big NO. This movie neither entertaining nor has any social message. I think director made this movie controversial deliberately so that film can be successful There is no logic in the Movie. If you go by acting Aamir scored a big zero, Anishka is OK, only good part is Saurabh shukla. Some of the goofs of the Movie(which this movie is fulled of but i am naming only few): 1)Anushka(Hindu) girl loves Sushant (Pakistani Muslim man) and decided to marry in church. 2)Aamir an alien falls in love with a human(anushka). 3) Anushka and sushant broke up while reading a letter which they thought sent by the other(Now thats i call a stupidity). More stupidity its Alien Aamir who got to know after reading Anishka mind with touch but wait a minute how Aamir got to know who has written the letter and how sarfaraz was innocent. he can only read Anushka mind not sarfaraz.

Put some religion masala and lot of emotions (especially by the background music) to compete the blockbuster bhel. Who cares about plot holes, dead looking sets, same old story, mediocre acting and dead music. Now, lets discuss story. The alien is shown to arrive on earth alone, without any co-workers or any instruments for his research. He finds \"dancing cars\" with their one window down and cloths on the back rest of the seat near to that window always and anywhere he needs to change the cloths. He doesn't understand the language but never tries to catch a hand until he meets Bhairo Singh! Strange na... Even stranger is that when Bhairo Singh tells him not to try to hold a man's hand, he understands and thereafter tries to catch only females' hand. That comedy extends extends whole 10 min including a song! He finally gets a chance to hold hands with a BHOJPURI sex worker in Rajasthan to absorb her language but he doesn't absorb any part of her life story, not that I'm aware of. But then he is shown to hold hands with a Sardar and this time, he absorbs only his recent story and not his vocabulary and dialect! What! Are there any filters available what to absorb and what not? Same is also true when he holds Jaggu's hands. Also, after the jail scene, why Jaggu (a young modern foreign return open minded journalist) refuses to hold hands with the alien is not understandable. And one another thing is not understandable that why the alien is \"talking\" to the other aliens in last scene when they don't need to talk to exchange the thoughts. These are just a few story flaws, there are many more. What are you doing Mr. Perfectionist?",

Since there are a ton of other good movies that carry 8+ ratings on IMDb, and deserve it, PK certainly doesn't fall into that category.**Spoilers**1. Predictable - within a couple of minutes, any intelligent movie goer would be able to predict that when the lead actress received a letter that was not signed, it is indeed not for her. She doesn't call this person, the other person doesn't call her and then everything just vines together during a live TV show. 2. An alien species that knows how to build space ships, will hang a remote on the person going for a first contact to an alien land, instead of somehow embedding it into the person's body. In clear view. Up for grabs by the first ruffian the alien comes by. This is an insult to intellectual movie enthusiasts.3. What was the objective of the alien? Just to get his remote stolen and then find it? You get one chance to connect with another species, and then you waste it by crying about a lost remote. Further, the concept of God is something that the alien suddenly not only understand, but starts believing in (during the TV show, he makes a comment about this). I am going off the rails here.Of course, the movie was about delivering a message, but when you are about to gross INR 500 Crores (something that 99.99% of the Indian population hasn't even seen), isn't it worth it to put extra efforts to come up with a better and intelligent vehicle to deliver it?I applaud the Indian public for seeing past all these deficiencies and focusing on the message.

Arbaaz Khan can tell a better story than this one).Rajkumar Hirani may walk away with the best director award(if the award judging panel is as dumb as some of the comments) for this film, but he is sure to lose many of his fans who admired his craft in his previous three films. The only person who holds this flimsy story together on screen is Anushka Sharma. Aamir is a mixture of cuteness and irritation. And at this stage of his career, not really a memorable performance from him. Sushant Singh, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla, etc have nothing to do in this film, and they do a good job of it. \"kahaa hai re tu bhagwaan\", movie PK dec 2014 \"mere nishaan hai kahaan\". movie OMG sep 2012You choose, whichever is better. PK isn't really that funny, isn't really that novel, isn't really a romantic movie, doesn't have much drama or thrills. No locales, no characters worth remembering. no scenes that touch your heart. No songs that can help propel the film. PK is like a seven course meal, that has no main dish. just starters and deserts.",

All Alien fuzz with OMG movie thing is not working well. During start, movie is very interesting till just before interval. Later it was too boredom to carry. Biggest Negative I would say is that movie compares anyone to saints and shows that saints are by default corrupt and greedy personal. It was utter waste of money (Rs 350) which I paid.

            "content": "The expectations were not high ever like it has been for PK....That's the problem with PK.... Raju Hirani's Track Record is brilliant ,,, and thankfully will remain the same after PK at least until his next movie .. The Munnabhai Series was great .. Being comical with though provoking concept is something which is liked universally. With 3 idiot Hirani and Aamir Khan had made a masterpiece , a movie made with perfection without a single flaw. So whats beyond perfection ! Nothing . And that's where PK stands , behind perfection and behind 3 idiot. As i have always said that the hardest movies to review for me are of Aamir Khan's as he is my favorite and i expect a lot from him always. I will try to keep my emotions out of it. So the movie starts with a spaceship flying around the sky of earth and left Aamir(yes he is an Alien) somewhere in Rajasthan to do analysis on earth and there people and somehow the remote which is used to call back his accompanied aliens is lost by him. That's all about first 15 min of the movie. Cut to Belgium we have Anushka Sharma fallen in love with a Pakistani boy(Susant Singh Rajput) and somehow separated before they can get married and Anushka came back home. This Belgium sequence was the most uninteresting part of the movies although in between that the Char Kadam song was really fresh and sweet to watch. Rest of the movie shows how in the way of finding the lost remote PK(Named unintentionally by the human beings) with the help of TV reporter Jaggu (Anushka) learn about the earth , people here , their believes and get confused out of it. The first half deals mostly with introduction of PK , establishing Anushka's character and PK telling the back story what actually happened to him when he was left by his fellows (which also includes how PK learned Bhojpuri - watch out for that sequence).Up to interval the flow was nice , no melodrama , full comic elements(although the level of comedy was not high as it was in Munnabhai and 3 idiot). Its the 2nd half where film drags a little bit and pull it down from perfection. The problem is that the way Hirani has tackled with the concept of God vs Godmen was not unique. It was too similar to OMG starring Paresh Raawal and was more hard hitting in OMG as compared to PK. And also the climax was of the track concentrating on the love relationship of Anushka and Sushant instead of the religious belief and the questions movie has asked earlier. Don't think i have to say anything about Aamir's performance. He has mastered his acting capabilities with each and every film . To play an alien is not an easy work but he has killed it. Anushka looked too cute , a girl to whom anyone can easily fall in love with , what exactly happened with PK too. SaUraV Shukla could have done a better job as a Godmen. Boman , Sushnat and Sanjay dutt are in the movie as extended cameos . Music suits the movie as situation bases although i have liked it more if Dil Darbadar song has been in the movie in full length. The song Bhagwan by Sonu Nigam has been picturized with great emotions.PK is a nice movie to end the year with , only if Hirani didn't have made 3 idiot before PK , it would have looked much better. Can't say this one was the best of this year , for me QUEEN got that position , still its one of the best this year have given us. 8.1 / 10 . by ANuP APu KuMaR.",

His comedic parentage runs along the Buster Keaton line. His muscular physique probably helps in his body humor. He's got a fun wackiness despite the intense weird face. The plot is surprisingly deep and the religious concepts are interesting. This is both hilarious and heartwarming. I do wonder if it would be better to not reveal his alien nature until much later. The audience should be dismissive like Jaggu at the beginning. The anniversary dinner is the perfect turning place with that reveal. Before that, his stories should be Jaggu shaking her head in disbelief. As for the ending, I would prefer to have crows and him not returning.

He does everything with good heart. PK combine many different emotions - in one moment you are laughing, because of the great humor, and on the next moment you're sad and you're barely crying. Rajkumar Hirani did it again he proved that Indian cinema have still that sense of good cinema . .its really \"once in a lifetime experience\" ..., and on the other hand is the great performance of Aamir Khan....The movie has it all too comedy,humanity and it challenges societal norms as well - teach us how to be human!

No God ever instructed to worship only him/her in any religious scribe. No God has ever written about themselves, it Humans who create story & write about god. The holy books of all these religions were not written by their respective gods. How did the early man come up with the idea of God? It has evolved over time...that seemed to focus more on the philosophical aspects of god. Life is Motion towards Knowledge & God is Complete Positive energy which one gets following the Past Knowledge, symbolization of our inner strength, morality, character & motivation for more creativity to follow...Fear & uncertainty of life is a basic instinct. It is present in every animal's mind. To overcome this fear we seek positive thoughts & reference, which is Knowledge (God). This positive reference (\"God\") is present in every culture, Evolution, and time period.Today, we don't know what dark matter and dark energy are, we don't know why there is a matter- antimatter imbalance, and we don't know how the combination of matter, dark matter, and dark energy keeps the universe from collapsing on itself or the objects inside to fly off in different directions, and this vitality of the universe is attributed to the Brahman or Tat (simply means \"that\"). The Vedas go to a great length trying to explain this, but leave many portions as questions, for the future learners to investigate. However, it does say that the end result is beyond the comprehension of the human mind...the most important thing is that it explicitly encourages only and only scientific inquiry to gain knowledge. It is the human interest and fascination with paradoxes that fuel both science and magical thinking, how can things be as we know they are one day, and the next day with new technology, be something else? The pursuit of God is the pursuit of meaning, the pursuit of Knowledge is the pursuit of truth.Example: The concept of God is introduced to children's mind so that they think that there is someone to control and punish them. Every parent tries to increase their child's confidence in writing exams by telling that God may help them in it if they study well. The concept of God may help one to become a better man and lead a peaceful life. This is the Psychological concept of God and plays a significant role in most people's life.",

As, in one of the scenes, it is said that in India, you can mess with anything BUT religion. While the theme of the movie is very close to \"Oh My God\", the story narration from an alien's perspective provided a very fresh angle to the whole issue. The direction is amazing with a very carefully managed story progression. The film, throughout, spends a lot of time on the core issue and the sub-plots (Sushant-Anushka story) received only enough time that was required, thus keeping the audience glued. The music has been bare minimum and very relevant. Especially, the song - Bhagwan Hai Kaha Re Tu - couldn't have been better in terms of execution and timing within the movie. For the cast, PK pulled out the best of Amir Khan. He managed his expressions, command over language, gestures and postures to the very perfection, he is famous in the entire industry for. Anushka Sharma managed to do justice to her talent with another good performance. Sushant made his presence felt in the movie in spite of the limited screen time. The rest of the cast - Sanjay Dutt, Saurabh Shukla, Boman Irani and Parikshit Sahani - supported the lead cast very well. It must be watched.

I like the way it was directed ( style wise) and i enjoyed some scenes where satire or sarcasm was ever present. The way the director brought out his eventual ' message ' is praiseworthy. However, I expected more overall. If one is familiar with India and it's society then it might not be a refreshing movie for that person. This isn't the first movie where the motives of following a religion and the way it's eventually practiced is been questioned indirectly. I'm not going to refer to the movie ' OMG ' because i've seen at least 10 bollywood movies where religion played a huge part. We all know the famous dialogues of Nana Patekar questioning the Indian society and the way SOME people in that society treat each other. There have been many movies trying to decrease the amount of prejudices in the Indian society. I expected something different. One might say that i expected a new recipe but instead i got a plate full of 'cliches'. Another dissatisfying point for me was the end of the movie. The whole issue with the letter was very, and i shall repeat myself, very PREDICTABLE. By filming it one could already guess the importance of such an irrelevant figure ( the other girl at the church). It's as if the writers were forced to end the movie in such a fashion that the Indian ' massala ' audience could leave the theatre with satisfaction. That is at one hand understandable but it was still very poorly written. It gave me the impression that the writers were out of ideas.It's not a bad movie though and it's still worth watching but i question those people who have made this movie look like it's a philosophical lecture. Perhaps i've set the bar too high for cinema in general but once you've seen a movie like Rashomon, which did had a philosophical thought behind it, your perception of cinema will be different from the mainstream audience.",

No, the film is not in the same league of Raj Kumar Hirani's earlier three brilliant films to be straight. But since it talks about the right things at the right time in a rare comical tone making the much needed impression, I would like you all to watch it before reading the review as a must.The first half of the film is full of many enjoyable sequences that at once remind you of few famous jokes read at the social networks, like remember that picture of sleepers having a lock keeping them together so that they don't get stolen in front of a temple or few enlightening jokes mixing two or more Gods together. Beginning with a very amateurish kind of love relationship developing overnight between Anushka and Sushant, it never gives you a dull moment before intermission with Aamir Khan speaking in a different hilarious tone, making brilliant face expressions, raising many thoughtful doubts on the existence of GOD.However the same cannot be said about its second half as here we go the same clich\u00e9d way with nothing novel as per the concept is concerned, having a completely predictable love angle thrown in (with the alien) thankfully not given too much footage in the narration. The last hour keeps reminding you of OH MY GOD with many similar settings and then the end offering few well-written twists and turns (involving the letter) brings smiles on your faces and tears in the eyes too as always expected from a Raj Kumar Hirani climax unconditionally. But overall, despite having that emotional end with another surprising cameo of a big star and all fixed ingredients of a Hirani film, PK is not able to give you that huge creative satisfaction, experienced in Hirani's earlier three films creating a big chemical locha in your hearts while walking out of the theaters.In the performances section, no doubt, Aamir plays his part extremely well making the best use of his odd ears. He simply excels as the alien and doesn't let you think about the flaws throughout the film leading from the front. Carrying the film all alone Aamir gets some fine support from Anushka Sharma, who once again proves her effortless mastery in playing such lively characters. Sushant Singh Rajput impresses in his few scenes, whereas Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Dutt and Boman Irani are not given any great roles to play quite surprisingly. Particularly it was really disappointing to see Boman Irani doing such an unimportant role after playing the lifeline of all three Hirani films till date, enacting three unique characters considered as benchmarks in the field of acting. Moreover here we have Parikshit Sahni once again doing the similar role of a father as seen in Hirani's previous movies along with Ram Sethi (Pyarelal) making a lovable cameo too.Music remains another weaker section of PK as I couldn't remember even one song while walking out of the theater. And that certainly wasn't the case in any of Hirani's earlier films. Yes both the lyricists and the singers have done their job very well but it was the melody I couldn't find in most of the songs in the soundtrack putting it honestly. To pick out a few its \"Chaar Kadam\" and \"Bhagwan\" sounding fine while watching the film, mainly due to their fabulous rendition by the talented singers. Adding to the comparatively weaker departments, this time neither the cinematography nor the background score was able to make some major contribution in the film quit unexpectedly.Coming to the major disappointment I felt while watching PK, first of all I wasn't really expecting a part two of OH MY GOD offering all seen before kind of sequences and dialogues. In fact this really puts me in doubts that whether Hirani had this idea of using the concept of GOD in his film before the release of OMG or developed it after that film getting some clear inspirations from its famous scenes. Having said that PK still has one big edge over OMG when it maintains the dignity of the concept of GOD as it is and doesn't interfere in its existence dragging him down to the earth giving it any commercial form. Adding to my disappointments, no doubt PK is a slickly written, well edited film with only few dragging moments in the second half. Still I cannot rate it above any of the three Hirani films seen earlier as it does lack that novel punch and falters in many sequences making it a forceful attempt (in its dialogues too) put together.",

OMG was terrific backed by solid script , solid dialogs , and superb Paresh Rawal acting. PK is backed by half baked script, with very weak dialogs, and not so good acting. In OMG , you can't think of some one better than Paresh sir, in PK any one could have acted better than AK. Music is OK, as there are far less songs in the movie than the entire album. Cheap vulgarity was not needed in the otherwise clean movie. Why AK and directors are hell bent on such road-side vulgarity is beyond comprehension. Comedy scenes are good and fits well in the story line. The starting of the movie is terrific and I should say out of the world. We expected a lot from talented director like Raju Hirani who gave us Munna Bhai series. But he failed miserably this time.Improvement areas ----------------PK can fetch whats going on in your mind by touching you. Imagine PK cant touch anyone for more than few seconds, and to understand Indian culture, he touches people of different languages, culture etc. He gets his mind messed up, and start speaking mixture of languages while talking. Movie talks only about GOD. Indian society is full of evils. It must have tackled lots of other issues too like corrupt politicians, black money.Burden --------Cheap vulgarity enough to keep kids away, and so family away.A one time watch, and after watching it, watch Oh My God(Paresh Rawal) if you haven't seen it.",

So PK is directed by Raj Kumar Hirani who have given India all in all entertaining and thought provoking movies. PK is no different... We can watch his movies 100 times without getting bored at least its true for me.. So Amir Khan as PK is the most influential character in this movie.Amir's performance is one that will be remembered for long time for this year along with Shahid's performance in Haider .PK comes from an alien planet and lost his communicating device which can help him get back to home.So he is stuck in our planet,somewhere near northern India. What follows next is his journey and his understanding the way people live here and the way people think here.... PK songs are cute...Some comedy scenes were hilarious.The movie touched my soul n made me cry in a couple of scenes... At the end when finally PK returns he lies to Anusha about the tapes he has recorded, something which pk has learned staying in our home.This just shows what kind of world we live in..PK also takes back some good memories to his home.The movie throws light on the beauty of simplicity, childishness n love.. This movie definitely borrows some concepts from \"Oh My God\" but it has so much more to it...It teaches a lesson in love too n the fact that there is only one GOD. It also somewhat binds the 2 neighboring countries(India n Pakistan)together. Anushka also did a good job... So to conclude... PK is one movie that u should never miss(best of this year)...Go watch PK now...Its a brilliant cinematic experience and one movie that simply touches ur heart....Aamir you rock n real king of bollywood!!! 10/10",

Although movie has several spots where it loses the pace, but for the requirement, it is required to get the best recipe.

            "content": "Unless I'm mistaken, I don't believe the name 'PK' was ever mentioned throughout the movie. By contrast, 'Tipsy' came up more than a dozen times but is not mentioned as Aamir Khan's nickname in the credits list. It became pretty obvious to me that the character of PK/Tipsy was modeled after 'Mork from Ork', whether intentional or not. At one point, I thought Tipsy would use a chair to stand on his head the way Robin Williams did when he auditioned for 'Mork and Mindy'. I liked the concept the movie had to offer. PK/Tipsy's beat down of phony religious practitioners was both irreverent and to the point, and one wonders how hucksters can fool so many people all of the time. There were some clever takes on the way PK came to understand life on Earth, as in his concept of money and dancing cars; the six hour language transfer by holding hands was a tenuous idea but Khan made it work. The thing that distracted me a lot about Khan's performance was that wild bug-eyed appearance he had. It made him look like maybe he was crazy, though for someone challenging the authority of the Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla), maybe that was precisely the point.Actress Anushka Sharma was quite refreshing as Jagat 'Jannu' Janani. Her eventual reconciliation with Sarfraz Yousuf (Sushant Singh Rajput) was well played out, though I did have a problem with the idea that they never tried to contact each other after the misunderstanding at the church. As is often the case with Hindi films, rather lengthy segments are given over to song and dance sequences, with the 'Lusty Lad' and 'Love is a Waste of Time' numbers being particularly vibrant and colorful. What gets me is the number of costume changes the principal characters undergo during the very same segment, something you never see in non-Indian productions. So that remains indigenous to Hindi films. All in all, an entertaining movie that unlike many coming out of India, doesn't seem quite as long as it's two and a half hour run time. You can probably chalk that up to the quirky story telling and likeable principal characters. For Aamir Khan, a bit of an offbeat role from other films I've seen him in, which only goes to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.",

            "content": "What I Love about PK: We are all in search of god, but no one does it the way PK does. He would make you laugh but also melt your heart and finally steal it away. Aamir Khan is the best thing about PK (I think Bollywood too!!). With the innocence and curiosity of a little child enters PK into this big bad world ('Gola' as he refers to it in the movie). In his search for God, to get his stuff back from him, PK takes us through the journey of emotions, blind beliefs, superstitions and truth. PK delivers a terrific performance and his Bhojpuri accent is like cherry on cake. He holds on to it beautifully during the entire movie and never for even a moment gets out of his character. With the kind of perfectionist Aamir is, you will not come home watching an Aamir Khan movie, rather you would be back home after meeting PK.Rajkumar Hirani is another shining star of the movie. He is one of the rare Bollywood directors, who actually can create magic on- screen. And in this movie he actually proves it. I love the execution of the Climax. The way the truth is revealed to the characters inside the film, similarly it is revealed to us. It makes you think, how a mind is conditioned to see only what it knows or believes and conveniently avoids justified logic and the other side of the truth. It's comes across like Pure Magic! So little that we get to see Sanjay Dutt these days, that the little guest appearance that he did as 'Bharon singh' also exhilarated me. He sure was well placed in the story and a delight to watch. What I thought was Average: With a rating of 4.5, there is hardly anything to write in this section. However, the music although sweet to your ears is not very memorable one. With 'chaar kadam' being the only song that I would play in repeat mode in my car, the rest of them are good enough, just when you are watching them in the movie. However a special mention to 'bhagwan hai kaha'. Sonu nigam strikes gold again. This song in the movie made me cry the most! Anushka was good but not great. I think she has a lot of scope of improvisation. Also something peculiarly unusual with her lips does not get unnoticed in the movie as well! What I did not like: We all fondly remember 'Virus' from 3 idiots and 'Dr Asthana' from Munnabhai MBBS. Sadly when I came home after watching the film, I could not even recall name of Boman Irani's character. Mr Irani is a great actor and he can even make regular roles memorable ones. He wasn't offered much to deliver in this one. Maybe he was just like a lucky Mascot to Hirani's movies. That is the only thing I did not like in PK. Take home message: If you are a Bollywood fan or a Hollywood fan or a movie fan in general, don't dare to miss PK. One of Aamir Khan's finest performance and undoubtedly the best movie of 2014. Also it might just change the perception of the way one seeks God!",

PK also taught me that best human being would be the one who serves humanity and not the one who is religious. Although the main story is somewhat similar to OMG, (Oh My God), it approaches the subject differently. Romance between Amir and Anushka did not add anything to the story. The development of the story was little slow but it never got boring. The songs were intelligently made, especially love is a waste of time was the best. I really appreciate the way Mr. Hiriani approached the subject. This movie shows that how to forget all the differences between us and live like human beings on this planet that we call home.

There's a beautiful message in there, that all humans should get and I don't think it's from another planet! So of course I will recommend it!

Meaningfully Funny \"Belief is the ignition switch that gets you off the launching pad.\" - Demos WaitleyPK is a simple story of an alien, which falls on the earth, sorry, on our India. May be, the simplest alien story ever told. An extra-terrestrial being visits our Earth, but loses the transporter remote of his space ship. Its journey to find the remote forms the crux of the movie, which throws light on the present spiritual scenario of our country, in a compelling and sarcastic manner. Belief is the force which drives humans to take certain decisions. A hope or belief in anything could make wonders. But the same belief in something 'wrong', welcomes disasters. The fruit of our life depends on what we decide to believe and what we don't. PK successfully questions this 'belief factor', which is being made a medium of business by spiritual leaders and Babas. It raises serious questions regarding the differentiation of religions among humans and the need for that differentiation. It also highlights some points regarding certain rituals and the way human belief is being exploited in the name of God. Discussing the 'most-discussed topic' i.e, about the existence of God is a complex matter. But Rajkumar Hirani's compelling narrative style explains this complex topic in a much simpler and funny way.. Scripting was perfect, but it reminded 'Oh My God' at certain instants, may be a mere chance of coincidence. Making was simple with comic and feel good moments. But it is an Aamir Khan show in all aspects. His own mannerisms make the character of Mr.PK, close to heart and memorable. This is what we call breaking free of stereo roles. His expressions were novel and antics were funny. Anushka Sharma too did a neat job, supported by Boman Irani, extended cameo roles of Sushanth Singh Rajput and Sanjay Dutt. Saurabh Shukla also rendered appreciable performance as Babaji The movie excelled in its technical side too. Cinematography was perfect, offered a good feel to the movie. Certain frames by CK Muraleedharan were new and gave a fresh feel. Music gave the film another feel, theme was good but songs could have been better. Editing by Hirani was crisp without any lag in between. Movie had a rich feel, Visual Effects were also of top class. Overall, Hirani's PK is a thought provoking film, presented in an entertaining way.My Rating: 4/5 Don't miss this alien Wait for a special guest appearance in post-climax. Yours Truly\u0085.Sooraj",

I failed to understand how Hirani spent 5 years after '3 Idiots' to write a script propping itself up shamelessly on the theme of 'Oh my God'. Not unexpectedly, the religion chosen to convey disdain for religious practice is, of course, the most docile one. It was a laugh-riot, no doubt when the protagonist reaches Earth and is stumped by the idiosyncratic religious practices. Aamir Khan did well but in some scenes labored & exerted more than required. Anushka Sharma was peppy and posh. However the subplot involving her romance with a gentleman (Sushant Rajput) was a sort of a distraction. Really the director was not sure of the strength of the main storyline and had to introduce such subplots. Also we should note that glaring mis-cast: Parikshit Sahni looked grandpa to Anushkha, not her father! Equally surprising was the under- utilization of Boman Irani. Also noteworthy was a sudden introduction without rhyme or reason of a lecture on sex and condoms. Agreed that a condom sponsor may have insisted on this, but this is not something I expect of Aamir. The whole audience was decidedly squirming. And what about the dancing cars? Is this become the standard operating procedure in India? Pretty gross and utterly unnecessary.

Don't miss this ride! If it takes 5 years (after \u202a\u200e3Idiots\u202c) for Rajkumar Hirani to create such a simple yet effective picture, then I'll wait for 2019 to watch his next.PS. A small surprise in the end. An indication of a sequel? Probably. I hope.",

It was A masterpiece which I had Witnessed. I really thought that MR RKh and mr VVC couldn't re capture the epic-ness that 3 idiots created. From the first trailer , I have been lying to myself that how awful the movie might end up. Though every time I would get a Goosebumps instead. Let's talk about the Movie .The movie takes a bit time to start but once Aamir Khan's character is introduced , it just a matter of time that forget that 2 and half hours of life is gone. I always said that Aamir khan needed a great script to back his performance up. BUT for me this Performance is a Top notch higher from any of his best works. I think Shahid Kapur just lost his Filmfare Award for the best actor. What can be said about Anushka Sharma, a breezy performance . She nails the character. Sushant Singh Rajput - BOSS!! this guy has a Great future. Sanjay Dutt - Magnificent. Mr irani and Shukla sir are fab their roles.The Direction is Top Notch. The Story is WOW!!!!! I wouldn't talk about it much. The Music is good. The technical department has done a great JobI don't wanna spoil this movie much. I went in as a hater and i came out a Happy person. I'm pretty sure People will this Movie more than 3 idiots .10/10 A Master Piece by the Team and Mind that Bought you 3 Idiotsp.S - SRK choose Happy New Year over this!!!!",

Though there's a similarity between 'Oh My God' and this movie, it's still too different, more unique and an innocent heart-touching one. Aamir Khan's character is so cute and not even a bit corrupted, like a new born baby, who takes time and learns the ways of the world. He gets confused by the concept of religion on earth and is even more confused by the business of Gods. It's a view point of an innocent mind, and that's so heavy a food for thought.",

I insist you to go and enjoy the film because.The main subject of the movie or so to say the \"Strong Message\", has been adapted by many movies before but PK stands far out from any of them.

First and for most it's a Hindi movie or should we say Bollywood Film. Come on people it's a new millennia now and still aren't we know what are Bollywood movies really are? Whether you like the movie or not, still, especially the critics must accept the fact on what is a Bollywood Movie really are. And it always goes to be a rendition or a copy from previous movies most of cases is from a Hollywood Films but I see nothing wrong in a Bollywood Film; for sometimes Bollywood came out to be a better copy than the original.So, 1. Do not compare this movie to \"Oh my God\" or whatsoever it is copied. They are different films, might have same storyline but still different. Judge something on its own alone and separate the other. 2. Do not compare this movie to international films(Hollywood, European Movies etc.). Every movies are make for the target audiences. So if we say maybe this works in India or Asia only, yeah maybe it should be 100% right, if you don't like it then leave it but if you're a foreign and come to love it, why not? 3.) Don't say its Racist for I see nothing. Be open minded and don't say its a blasphemy of religion. Accept the fact in mortal life we really came up to a situation that we questions the things we believe are. It's a matter of point of view and opinions. And I like how PK depicting it and avoiding the serious matters by mixing a satire comedy, alien and love story. 4.) I can say this is another awesome work from the director/writer Rajkumar Hirani and credits to staff and entire productions of PK. But their is nothing exceptional nor special in this movie. This is just a typical movie, not a brand new idea and acting are not even the best that the casts can show but as a whole the movie promise to entertain with all of the flavors that a Hindi/Bollywood (Dancing & Musical Interval etc.) movie can offer. So to those whining, quit it and the 8.5 rating in IMDb is a fact and irrevocable. 5.) Well its entertaining :)",

The second minute into the movie, and you know that something's out of the box in the movie. After around 10 minutes, you start realizing why Aamir Khan is such a versatile and gifted artist. As soon as he comes on the screen, you get attached to his role. He single handedly carries the entire first half of the movie on his shoulders. Such amazing is his screen presence that you would hardly notice any other character in the movie's first half. Having said that, all the other actors in the movie have played their role amazingly, especially Saurabh Shukla. The innocence and cuteness of both Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma will make you feel very good. The film has some naturally funny scenes that have been implemented amazingly. At one moment there is an emotional scene, and the very next moment there's comedy. Though its not an out and out comedy, but its got enough humor to keep your laughing bones tickling, especially one long comical sequence when PK visits different holy places. The second half is also quite good, maybe I thought the last 15 minutes or so were a bit extended although it was there for conveying a different message. And thats the reason why I went with 9. Overall, Aamir Khan is a treat to watch and it might perhaps be his best ever performance. Anushka, Sushant, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla have played their roles equally well (Saurabh Shukla deserves a special mention). Having said that you cant take away the credit from one of the country's finest director - Rajkumar Hirani. The direction is superlative and each shot has been executed amazingly. He has proved why he is the king of humor. The scenes switch from extremely emotional to comical with such an ease. Both Raju and Abhijat Joshi have spent considerable time in imagining each and every scene. They have written an almost perfect script. Thumbs up to both of them. Raju, you are a true master.The music is situational and carries on with the film. You'll surely appreciate the music after watching the movie. The song 'Love is a Waste of Time' has been continuously humming in my mind since I've come out of the theater.So Guys, go to the theaters nearby and experience the movie. The movie has some strong messages, and some smaller messages as well. Its been a long time a masterpiece had arrived in bollywood.",

But now a days we are concentrating more to protect religion. Surely if God created this whole universe then He has got enough power to protect himself. We don't need to quarrel or don't need to bomb people in the name of God. Instead if we help each other to solve problems and sufferings, we surely can create a better world for us and for coming generations. There is no sign in a newborn baby which can surely indicate he/she is a Hindu,Muslim or Christian. First we are all human beings then we shall think about religion. Rajkumar Hirani is one of the best directors and he delivered the message in a very unique artistic way that every Indian will love to watch this.

It deserves 0 stars but I am forced to give 1 star.This movie also reminds me of 3 idiots in the sense that the first half was excellent while the second half was filled with utter nonsense like making delivery of pregnant woman at home using batteries and TV instructions!

Aamir Khan as alien was delightful throughout the movie,followed by powerful cast support from Anushka Sharma & Sanjay Dutt. Direction was undoubtedly well but storytelling could have been better.What both disappointed as well as satisfied me was the plot.I somehow felt that the sarcasm of human beliefs and an alien story was a mismatch.The technical & logical presentation of an alien seemed weak.For e.g :P.k needed to touch someone's hand to both learn the language & read his/her mind.But when P.k touched the prostitute's hand to learn Bhojpuri why didn't he read her mind too when touching her hand was the common functioning?In other words how could he control the two functions when the play button was the same?Again how did p.k remain unwound-ed and well alive being in the proximity of the blast in the train?Also the sudden falling in love of Jaggu on just meeting some beautiful man seemed quite dreamy.Besides,several questions raised on religious issues were quite intellectual & thought provoking.Coming to music,other than 'Chaar Kadam' & 'love is a waste of time' rest were forgettable.RHF films should try & improve the technical parts.Overall to me,PK was a decent watch from start to end.For an Aamir Khan fan ,its quite satisfying but as a movie Pk isn't powerful enough rather its over-hyped.",

Such a track record is hard to equal...let alone beat. Now I am not saying it's his best...but it's awfully good.The story begins with PK (Khan) arriving on Earth from his enormous space ship. However, there are two problems. First, he's naked as folks from his planet don't understand nor need clothing. Second, some jerk sees him and steals his amulet from around his neck...and that amulet has a device on it that allows him to communicate with his people. And, without it, he's stuck on Earth.The scene abruptly switches to Belgium* where Jaggu (Anushka Sharma) meets and falls in love with Sarfraz. This is a HUGE problem when she discovers that he's not only a Pakistani but Muslim....and she's an Indian Hindu. Now if you don't know how this is a problem, animosity between these countries and religions have resulted in many thousnads (or more) deaths since these republics were founded in 1947. This would be akin to a Jewish Israeli falling in love with a Palestinian! Not surprisingly, her family is aghast and the 'holy man' who the family looks to for guidance (Sanjay Dutt) warns that the man will betray her. And, only the next day, when she is to marry him, it appears as if this is exactly what has happened.The scene then abruptly switches to India. Jaggu now works for a TV news type program and hopes to get better stories than the fluff she's doing now. And, when she meets PK, she is intrigued by how weird he is...and how he just doesn't seem normal. But she also comes to like him....even when she thinks he might just be insane. Why? Well, he insists he's from another planet!The rest of the film is about religion. It seems that when PK was stuck here, he saw that humans prayed to God for help...so he decides to ask God to help him find his amulet. But WHICH God?! After all, he notices that each religion claims that they alone speak for God...and this cannot possibly be. And, despite trying all the various major religions, his amulet is still missing. This leads him to a realization...that the leaders of these religions don't realize they aren't talking to God but are mistaken....and Jaggu decides to put him on TV to talk about this...causing an unexpected sensation. What's next? See the film.The ecumenical story like isn't all that surprising, as this has been a passion of Aamir Khan in other films and real life. I am sure it will offend some....and it certainly did in India (some clerics tried to have the movie banned). But apparently it hit the right note with viewers, as it became the most popular film in Indian history up to that time**!So is it any good? Absolutely. But for me the best parts were not the comedic parts with Aamir Khan looking and acting goofy. The best, by far, was his questioning religion AND Jaggu's busted relationship...both of which could make up an entire movie in and of themselves. A tad uneven but one of the better Bollywood pictures.*I found it funny that practically everyone in Belgium seems to speak Hindi...the locals AND the Pakistani boyfriend (they speak Urdu, not Hindi).**Since this time, another Khan film, \"Dangal\", has surpassed \"PK\" as the #1 box office film in Indian history.",

            "content": "Rajkumar Hirani, Aamir Khan, Sanjay Dutt:-These names are enough to bring about the Golden Memories of the Munnabhai Series and 3 Idiots. Now when they combine through a coarse of 5 years for a movie, expectations are bound to be sky high.There was a lot of curiosity as to what will the movie be about and will it be as phenomenal and sensational as the previous ones by Hirani Sir. Well, everything is answered in this 2hr 33min flick which impresses one and all.I won't reveal the story here but just provide some shadows to what the movie is about and how the things transpire. PK (Aamir) lands in a desert of Rajasthan and is being robbed of his prized possession which leads to a journey of search which in all senses is no less than epic.Aamir's journey is a visual delight to all. He meets Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt) who is a Rajasthani and guides his young and unknown friend in times of need. Through his advice, PK heads to Delhi which is where the story moves ahead.In Delhi, he meets Jaggu aka Jagat Janani (Anushka Sharma) who is a budding reporter. The trust factor led to PK revealing his story to Jaggu and it is just superb to watch as a viewer. Jaggu's father (Parikshit Sahni) is upset with her as she had fallen for a Pakistani guy Sarfaraz Yousuf (Sushant Singh Rajput).What PK portrays is a true and real scene of the mentality of the people on Earth, the fact that how blindly we follow God and the people who work as the ones who can lead to God. The manner in which religion related issues have been shown would bring about joy on our faces but it is indeed the hardcore reality of this World on the whole.Viewing this movie from the point of view of PK made me feel so unwanted in this World. The system and working is tough for all to understand. Yet, blindly, myself included, we follow this system. Who started this? What is the use of this? Did GOD demand this? DO we need to take hardcore measures to get things done and impress God? These are some of the questions raised by this one and the manner of presenting it seems so realistic and true.The way the question is raised on the so called gate keepers of God is the thing to watch in this movie. Given the quality of people associated with this one, we can expect it to be good in every aspect and it mostly is.PK has one of the best 1st half Bollywood has ever seen or witnessed, it is just splendid in the way it has been presented. The aura changes in the 2nd half but it doesn't shed away from the content and focuses on giving it a quality finish.Well, even though I have praised it, this movie is certainly the weakest of the ones made by Raju Hirani but still, it is one of the best of 2014 which proves that he is a Champion when it comes to film making. This movie lacks in terms of the intensity and depth generated by Munnabhai MBBS, 3 Idiots and Lage Raho Munnabhai. But the Direction is spot on by Hirani Sir again. We can see his flavor all through the movie. His expertise of portraying the most simplest of scenes with utmost perfection is depicted again in this movie.The script is very well written by Raju Hirani Sir and Abhijit Joshi. Yes there are a few minor flaws but it can easily be overlooked. Editing is also done by Raju Sir and it has been very well done. Cinematography is C.K. Muralidharan is top notch, one to admire and respect.The best thing about PK are its mind blowing Dialogues. I haven't seen such wonderful and catchy dialogues for a longtime now.Coming to the music, I had heard the whole album long ago and felt that the songs would be situational. It turned out to be true and just as I had said to some of my friends, \"Bhagwan Hai Kahan Re Tu\" sung by Sonu Nigam did bring tears in my eyes. It is such a song which brings out all the emotions, hits the right zones and the video adds to the intensity. Dil Darbadar by Ankit Tiwari is also melodious whereas Chaar Kadam by Shaan and Shreya Ghoshal provide a serene simplicity. Tharki Chokro fits perfectly as does Nanga Punga Dost. All in all, the music is simple and Shantanu Moitra needs to be credited for it.Mr. Perfectionist himself Aamir Khan can be proud of what he has done in PK, it can be placed in one of his finest works till date. He carries the movie on his own with ease and grace. Anushka Sharma does a phenomenal job and I was literally surprised watching it, she acts brilliantly all through the movie. I guess working with the best brings out the best in you fits perfectly for Anushka. I was so happy to see Sanjay Dutt back, missed him so much. No wonder he is my favorite and I loved every glimpse of his act. Sushant as Sarfaraz has done a very good job and those scenes in Belgium have been shown beautifully. Boman Irani and Parikshit Sahni do justice to what they have to deliver. Saurabh Shukla had an important role of Tapasvi Maharaj and he did well to keep up with the tempo.All in all, PK is indeed a wonderful movie which needs to be watched by all. It asks the right questions and the manner of portraying it is what wins the battle. I will rate it 4.25/5.",

Starting was good, I was enjoying the movie until they started bashing Hindu Gods and Godmen in this movie. As a Hindu and Indian, I was very embarrassed to see this movie as this movie was forcing it's viewers to accept that Pakistani men are always trustworthy and Hindu Godmen are thugs. They pushed it very hard by showing Shiva as very fearful god and many Gods as Missing. It was more of like Oh My God were an atheist question's Gods existence. As they can't dare to criticize Islam by a human being they brought in Alien to bash religions and Godmen. What a cheap thought by our bollywood giants like Rajkumar hirani and Aamir khan. I will never watch movies from Aamir Khan now as if he wanted he could have always stopped this non- sense in his movie.Questions to movie makers and aam aadmi who watched this movie: - Do you really need a Pakistani guy with Hindu Indian girl to make the story secular? Why can't you take Pakistani girl and Hindu Indian guy? You fear your life for that? - Why you keep bashing Hindu gods and never dare to do so for other religions? Do you want to show that Hindus are impotent? - Why do you want to make FUN of religions by an alien? Because you knew that what you are doing is NOT GOOD and not acceptable by humans.Overall, I was so much hurt by watching my God running for His life by some alien, my Godmen kept on bashing by some alien, Pakistani guy is shown faithful and honest and my Godmen is shown as Thug. Wake up India, they are punching you in your heart and you are praising it!! Are we so much liberal to accept this? NO, we are impotent to even touch them!",

It was a refreshing and welcoming change to usual Bollywood cinema, and a path I think more filmmakers should consider venturing on. I did not expect Indian cinema to focus on concepts of religion and faith to this degree, but I have nothing but positive opinions of the manner in which this film was made. This film is funny, heart warming and eye opening. PK's naivety and innocence is a strong attempt in restoring faith in humanity more than ever. It questions the man made boundaries of religion and faith and leaves the viewers wondering about humanity, religion and other aspects touched upon in the film. Although the film is filled with humorous moment, the deeper significance is as bold as ever. I loved this film for Aamir's acting and the concepts it experimented with. Actually, all the major roles were quite well performed. With the humor and distinct Bolly-ness of the film, it caters to the audience that looks for a good laugh and at the same time the film also caters to those looking for substance and meaning. I would definitely consider it to be a bold move in Indian cinema, one that sets the bar very high. My top 5 films of the year for sure!",

Amir was previously famous for making movies which were the most realistic (with respect to other Bollywood movies), but D3 was a disgrace and now PK is downright dumb and disrespectful and fake. I along with many of his previous fans, have lost all faith in him.",

After all its Raju Hirani film and in no way you are gonna leave your brains at home. For the director who gave 2 of the masterpiece in Munnabhai and an excellent 3 idiots, I could not connect with its main protagonist as I did in earlier of his films. Yes Amir does his share of acting but every time he questions God, it reminded me of Paresh Rawal from Oh! My God, so the movie did not left any impact but instead it refreshed my memory of OMG. Remember those last scenes from both Munnabhai series, my heart still races when I see those scenes now, but PK did not left any of those types of impact. And that last scene where PK and that guru argue about God and Anushka goes on to call her long lost love around the world on national television, the film deviates from its point and that kind of ending is just unacceptable. Had I seen PK before OMG, 3 idiots and Munnabhai, it would have been a classic but for now its just a movie that is neither bad nor good.",

We already have 'OH My God' and I must say that one or two scenes of the movie are so similar to OMG that I had a sense of Deja-vu. But majorly PK's script deals with it from totally different perspective and the message comes out even more clearly in a very simple statement \u2013 'Watch out for wrong numbers!!'PK also brushed through the issue of Indian stigma on Sex. But I would encourage the readers to NOT leave their Kids at home because of this. Take them along. It's much much less vulgar than the Item numbers coming on your television set.Overall the movie has lot many laughing sequences, dancing car as one\u0085 hilarious!! Second half is quite serious and at a point it gets too heavy that few of us may start losing interest. Well thanks to the underlying message and the Acting (spl. Aamir Khan), you are continuously kept attached.Finally, I would say it's a 'Good Movie' definitely a must watch with Family \u2013 4 out of 5.",

A high expectation and eagerness to see Aamir in a new avatar. Coming to the movie So Aamir has done very well to his role, he will make you laugh and make you cry, a very childish and innocent guy who is trapped in the Earth and cannot go home. Where as Anushka has also done pretty well with small hair. Some comedy scenes and laughing moments in the movie, it will also make you very emotional sometime. Sanjay Dutt's role was cut short and Booman Irani role was also not used very much. After seeing the movie it seemed to me a combo of Oh My God. The plot started with a Alien lost his device to making a statement at the end that Muslims don't cheat people. The Social message is exceptionally well shown in the movie. Aamir has been shown eating lots of Paan in the movie but it has nothing to do with him as it shown in the movie trailer. Expected this movie to be a Materpeice but i got a bit disappointed. Found so many Errors and mistakes in the movie. I am not criticizing the movie, You will find yourself find it when you watch it. Thou it was worth watching PK.",

            "content": "Rajkumar Hirani comes out of the cave and serves a story to an originality-starved audience about an alien who addresses, and later discusses, stark and serious issues regarding the inhabitants of Earth using humor and superficial philosophy. The final product is a parody of these issues which are openly contrived using humor and illogic. The irony of the whole drama is at the gist of the movie, which most of us are happy to term the best film of 2014.Touching a topic so sensitive and bold as divinity, the writers manage to mix the dramatic narration with ounces of lousy humor. That is the biggest problem PK faces as it moves ahead with its fabler.Starting off with a cleavage-revealing, poem-loving Indian Jaggu (Anushka Sharma masquerading as Donald Duck), the story hits the clich\u00e9 bumper right at the beginning. In a Belgian city infested with Hindi-speaking Indians, she falls in love with a Pakistani (typecast Sushant Singh Rajput), which, of course, her pious family prohibits. Following another clich\u00e9, which is made to not look like a clich\u00e9 at a later period, Jaggu becomes a TV reporter out of thin air. Then comes the alien and helps her ante up the viewer ratings of the channel she works for. The alien PK (Aamir Khan), all his characteristics a gimmick, from his language to his nuances, acts so dumb, I started losing faith in science as well. Jaggu's family is forgotten both by Jaggu and the audience, only to be reminded later by the shaky screenplay.This personality, which is supposed to intrigue the audience, asks certain questions we already have heard before. He tries to answer these questions like an Engineering student answering in an oral examination. The similarity: diplomacy. He quickly acclimatizes himself according the traits of human beings and that is when Hirani's fading creativity emerges into the silver screen. PK lands in Rajasthan where humans are busy sharing bodily liquids in cars with open windows. Even if it was a way of addressing the issue, I'm afraid the film should be categorized as an NGO or even better \"the moral police.\"PK successfully addresses issues such as Pakistan-India conflicts, value of Gandhiji as a figure in currency notes, God's existence, culture, tradition, religious orientations, religion per se, religious practices, marriage, sex, terrorism (at a laughable juncture), cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption (to name a few). But it never absolves the purportedly guilty audience by providing any answers, hacks, or tweaks to sort out or cleanse these issues. Much like how ineffective the statutory warnings that play before the beginning of Indian movies are, PK, as a celluloid, fails to pull itself together and emphasize on a point.The direction is fine, but the ridiculous screenplay contributes to an array of goof-ups, and eventually gives birth to nonsense. Many primary characters in the film are seen laughing in most of the frames, probably to remind the audience to laugh along, because as far as an agnostic like me is concerned, I may have chuckled 2-3 times. The narration tries so hard to induce humor, it ends up exhausting itself.Other than a fine collective cast performance, there is no other factor that I can generally laud PK for. And what the hell was that 18th century depiction of a spaceship (straight out of Rakesh Roshan's ancient film Koi... Mil Gaya) doing there? My 2-year old niece could come up better than that. CGI, thus proved, should be done without in Indian cinema.All said and done, the film urges its viewers to stop idolizing God, but instead do something that PK never exemplifies in the film. As God- fearing patrons walked out of the hall after watching PK, I could sense an essence of dwindling religious beliefs in them. By the time they reached the parking lot, the beliefs were at an all-time high. People who had been PK-ized minutes ago had suddenly rolled back into being themselves: choosy, God-fearing hypocrites. And that is the shoe- shining effect of PK: it suggests everything, but confirms nothing. The power of a gimmick is evident with PK, and it is in our senses that we differentiate.BOTTOM LINE: Other than blatant addresser of few serious issues, PK could best be described as a united advertisement for Duracell batteries, monsterjobs.com, Vijay Sales, and Maruti SX4 which all had the single advantage of being endorsed by Aamir Khan, arguably an epitome of creative-guy-to-naive-guy story.can be watched with a typical Indian family?

K.'s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go. Finally, it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers from worlds apart.

            "content": "Maybe my wife and I are the only ones who felt disappointed with P.K. When she watches the film she's looking purely at its \"entertainment\" value. I'll admit, for me a film should make sense also. P.K. didn't work at either level. Both of us absolutely loved all Raju Hirani films in the past. We expected this film to be good too but didn't go with very high expectations and had not read up much. After watching the film her rating is 3 and mine is 5 so I settled for 4. The first half was barely tolerable for her but I was not to lose hope easily, I thought the second half will probably carry the film through. The second half did arrest our attention more, yet it let us down on the whole. It was definitely not \"experience of a lifetime\", as one reviewer commented. The number of small gripes is too many to mention here. Here's a sample - repetitive jokes on lead character's name; way too much Bhojpuri; a person of Parsi accent is shown as a fanatic Church going Christian who throws Aamir out of the Church (how could this have slipped through, I have no clue. Parsis are Zoroastrians. BTW, we are neither Parsi nor overly religious). We found the religion ass-whacking being stretched too far and too long in the film. The whole alien thing was tiring too - a sculpted body for an alien didn't make sense; an evolved alien specie that communicates telepathically is shown to have the same range of emotions as humans, that didn't make sense either.But those are all small gripes. What I found most significant though is that the film fails on a more fundamental level on its core theme. Hirani picks easy targets with religious heads and fundamentalists like the earlier film (OMG). Also like that film he successfully points out the apparent meaninglessness of religious rituals but does not force people to look inwards to self-reflect. Nor does he address the more difficult question of a substitute to religion. (More serious seekers may find the answer elsewhere, for example, in the amazing Anastasia book-series by Russian author Vladimir Megre)In final analysis P.K. is a lame attempt at mass appeal. It fails at both entertainment and providing meaning. A big departure from Munna Bhai films and 3 idiots. Let me predict that the film will also see a sharp decline in box office collections after the initial hype is over.",

I love Aamir Khan as an actor and his films such as Taalash and Ghajni are simply awesome.So I sat down with my popcorn to watch this. Credits role.Alien I see. It's sci-fi. Brilliant. I love sci-fi. Then it changes. It's an alien learning earthly ways. It changes again, it's an alien challenging the absurdity of religion. I thought YESSSS!!! India a country drunk with religion needs to be sobered up.What followed next was sooooo disappointing. Clich\u00e9. Vomit inducing love story. Clumsy dialogue with pseudo logic.OK let me tell you my problem. If a film like this wants to challenge religion then you have to get to the heart of the matter. Let me give you examples.Cue Pakistani Muslim in Love with Hindu Indian girl. Moral at end Pakistani Muslim men are respectful of women. Errr actually there is an inherent problem within Islam that treats Kafir women as fair game. Cue the 1500 abuse case of underage girl in Rotherman, UK. Other Pakistani Muslim abuse gangs in the UK? A coincidence? - The film should have challenged the misogynistic nature of Islam.Another example. Cue Hindu man pointing finger at Christian priest for conversion. No mention of the fact that the caste system which is the central basis of Hinduism and treats low caste people like chattels maybe reason why people convert.Another example - cue the Christian man - they touch briefly on the Christian conversion as an open thing that Christians do. No mention of the underhand tactics used by American and UK missionaries to go and convert people.Cue the Sikh - no mention of the fundamentalist strain that is infiltrating Sikhism. No mention of the corruption that is creeping into the Gurudwara's. No mention of the Baba's that are putting a blight on the philosophy of Nanak, that specifically requires people not to have a living person as a Guru.I could go on ad infinitum.For me the film is not cutting enough. The mush with the idiotic Pakistani - Indian love story ruined it for me, which turned into some sort of mystery that had to be solved by the lovable alien detective PK. The flaws in religion and religious thinking are far more fundamental than this and cannot be sugar coated like this.Love doesn't conquer all I'm afraid. Logic and Reason conquers all.You missed a trick Rajkumer Hindani!!",

PK is innocent, PK is like a child, PK doesn't do it all on purpose to troll others......By the way, by the above, in no way am I implying that criticising religions in a straight forward manner should be a taboo. Who am I to object?That one dialogue at the end where he chides the saint, saying that God doesn't need protection from a person of a city of a planet that is just a tiny little part of the galaxy, and consider that there are multiple galaxies too (or something along the lines). That was a game-sealer for me! Was it a discovery for me? No, but the way he said it made me feel awestruck and made me realise what a small part of God's scheme I am myself. A great answer!Apart from all this, the great thing was the connection put between one scene and the next one, and so on and on......Also, PK's innocence and being so unaware of our planet was depicted in such a sweet manner.",

From the very start where PK enters, to the interval to the final scene - you're simply laughing non stop with endless emotions to go alongside it. There are a few flawed scenes however which is why I didn't give it a perfect 10 score. Also the condom scene and the 'dancing car' scenes are a little cringe and quite awkward to watch if you're watching with family. Performance wise Aamir Khan is at his supreme best and this will be considered up there with his best work ever. His bhojpuri dialogues, his silly mannerisms, his naivety and simpleness are all portrayed on screen with such ease. Anushka Sharma is outstanding in her role as Jaggat Janani and you really do find it difficult to think who else could have done the role as well as she did. To stand so tall in every scene with a powerhouse like Aamir - a lot of credit has to go to her! Sushant is effective in his short role. Boman Irani and Sanjay Dutt are two who could have had meatier roles, but then again the film didn't require it. Saurabh Shukla is first rate! All the performances in the film leave their mark, which is something we have become used to with a Raju Hirani film! The music of the film certainly adds to it, and it's a typical Hirani album. My favorites are Bhagwan hai kaha hai tu and Chaar Kadam. Overall PK is a super hit film. One of those films which you can watch over and over again. Watch it for the simple facts that it is a Raju Hirani film. If you're an Aamir fan - you're in for a delight. If you're not - watch it for an outstanding performance!",

            "content": "An alien struggles to accustom to human tradition while searching for his stolen remote.PK- a movie in making for close to five years has overwhelmingly satisfied all its expectations. Gems like these are rare and whether or not it is considered Oscar-worthy, the movie should be preserved as a case study for future film makers.Just like his production house's logo (puppet show), Raj Kumar Hirani's films are simple in theme yet very attractive by means of its presentation. He has a magical lens that peers into the Indian Diaspora and tears down its misbeliefs elegantly, no matter how high it is held. It wouldn't be an overstatement when I say, \" he is one of the very few in the business who consistently satisfies both producers and (global) audience.\"Hope was seeded in me during the movie. Every time a religious belief was opposed there was claps and whistles from all around the screen, a clear sign that the general population is becoming increasingly logical rather than being superstitial. With several close-up shots (especially in the Belgium episode), Anushka's pout was hard to miss. Don't be surprised if she wins the Best Pout Award.From a broader perspective it's not just an alien who would struggle in this world. For the sake of argument, imagine bringing back one of the early humans to the present world. He would face the same dilemma that Aamir does in this movie. Clearly it's our evolution (with plenty of revolutions in it) that is to be blamed (or praised).Despite being a sci-fi \"based\" movie with love and emotion it is humour that persists till the end. Be it the dancing cars that act as Aamir's ATM cum wardrobe, his search for God, the slipper that he steals when his own are missing, his questions to god-men, all of them no matter how serious an issue, are presented in a humorous enjoyable way. But irrespective of how much the movie takes upon god-men it doesn't hurt the basic ideology of religion.Various modulations of accha (\"Good\"), I love Chicken, Anushka'a analogy of PK with child are worth mentioning among many such beautiful lines.But tell us Aamir, why did you settle for an outdated transistor radio when there were plenty of other cool devices. AAA: Despite being a U-rated movie, three A's ruled the movie. Aamir, Alien, Atheism. Enough said.PS: A surprise cameo awaits you at the end.",

Muslims and fanatic Islamists butchering people all over the world. This movie shows Hindus in a very negative way. There are thousands of fake Muslims peers and babas in India plying their trade. Why? Because India is a democracy. This anti-Indian movie needs to be banned and the actors need to be sent on a one way trip to the country that funded this movie....Pakistan. Looks like they will fit in fine with the fanatics over there who blindly hate hindus and anyones not Muslim. Muslims have a thousand year history of barbarism and treason in the country. Starting as sporadic invaders, Muslims slowly usurped entire lands, kingdoms and wealth. The destroyed over million of temples and built mosques over them. Trouble with the educated Muslim clean shaven jihadist is they don't talk publicly about their views but they are deep rooted to the jihadist ideology and can go any extent to support the violent causes as prescribed in the Islam.

            "content": "P.K. , a fantastical comedy-drama by Rajkumar Hirani, mocks and highlights various societal beliefs. Rajkumar Hirani follows the tried and tested formula of his, light hearted comedy coupled with a strong social message. While its no '3 Idiots,' P.K. doesn't fail to impress. Amir Khan is brilliant as always in his portrayal of an alien astronaut (P.K.), who has landed on Earth for a research expedition. PLOT ( *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* ) :As soon as he lands, the 'remote' which must be used to summon his spaceship is stolen. With no way to communicate with his people, he is left wandering around and searching for the mystical looking device. Being an alien, he's unable to understand the faiths and beliefs of us human beings. He starts asking questions which leave the onlookers baffled. During his quest for the remote he encounters Jaggu (Anushka Sharma), a journalist. She is fascinated by his story. Intrigued by his questions,she sensationalises them on the television. He takes on Sadhu Tapasvi ji,who incidentally happens to be Jaggu's family guru and had ruined her relationship with Sarfaraz(Sushant Singh Rajput) by a malicious prediction. *END OF SPOILER*Sanjay Dutt and Sushant Singh Rajput are great in their extended cameos in the movie. Acting performances by the side actors and supporting cast was better than satisfactory. Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla, both veterans, seem underused in this rather longish movie.Being a movie inclined towards the mockery of blind followers of various faiths and dogmatic individuals practicing bigotry, the movie is a brave attempt in this highly radical society of ours. The movie is comedic and funny, and will keep you entertained throughout. There are a few loose ends in the script, which are barely noticeable to be fair.Due to similar themes, the movie may be compared to Oh My God (OMG). However, the plot is different, and the movie manages to keep things fresh and crisp. The setting may be unrealistic in nature, but the moral is very relevant and simple. The movie and its protagonist,though alien, preach peace, love, and 'humanity'.",

Truly a movie that has to be seen by one and all as this, if not completely, at least to an extent resolve the differences we have because of religious divisions. Movie opening scene is a naked Khan coming out of a spaceship and almost immediately is greeted by a thief robbing him of the \"signal sender\". Now clothes-less Khan, with no way to go back to his home planet, is stuck in the desert of Rajasthan. Then the movie shifts to Belgium where Anushka hooks up with Shushanth who is a Pakistani. They fall in love and agree to marry with the obvious opposition form her parents and a godman. But due to some misunderstandings they split up and the godman's words were assumed to be true. Movie shifts to New Delhi where Anushka runs into Aamir Khan. Aamir explains how he lost his signal symbol. How he ran into Sanjay dutt and how he landed in Delhi from Rajasthan. In Delhi on someone's \"advice\" he starts praying to god asking for his \"property\" back. He follows all gods, does all the routine rituals of each god. But little did he know that's not how god works. Then he realizes his \"property\" is with the godman and he is about to rout a lot of money from people saying its a religious talisman.After few scenes anushka believes him and gives an introduction to he channel manager who wants to do a story based on aamir khan and the godman with who he has an old grudge. There are many hilarious scenes where khan takes on the godman who is a fake and divides people on the basis of religion. In the end the movie is about how aamir retrieves his \"property\" from the godman and how he unites Anushka and Shushanth. Performance wise Aamir Khan steals the show. Anushka has done a sensible movie since her debut. Sanjay Dutt and Boman Irani are at their best. Shaushanth has no apparent role but was passable in the scenes where he is in. Rajkumar Hirani is perhaps the only director who can make comedy movies with a strong message. The minus are shushanth Anushka chemistry and a bit dragging first half. The music was OK as it just managed to get the feel of the movie but could have been way better. Finally this movie must be watched by all so that whoever have any differences in their minds about people from other religions can sort of understand its nothing. Good movie.",

            "content": "Is it funny? At times. Thought-provoking? A little. Tedious? At times. Entertaining? Fairly. Does it use religious stereotypes? Yes. Does it offend? It may offend those who expect more from cinema.If you enjoyed Lage Raho Munna Bhai then don't let the familiar names and faces raise your hopes, as this is not nearly as witty, wise or well-crafted as that gem of a film. I imagine Abhijat Joshi himself would be cringing at overwrought scenes like the one showing the guru identifying people by religious attire only to find it contrast with their names as they introduce themselves. At the same time there are clever elements that make you think, and perhaps be a bit less likely to be misled by prejudice and \"wrong numbers.\"The usual take on religious satire is that, like a jeweller protecting genuine articles from cheap imitations, the sincerely faithful would welcome efforts to expose fraud and disown the exploitative behavior perpetrated in the name of religion, be it pressured / forced conversions, terror attacks, or claiming clairvoyance.Consider, which is the greater evil - taking money or taking lives? So even though the focus of the story is not the sloppily placed terror incident, it suggests that there are worse things than cheating, while plodding ahead to take down the fraudulent guru and by extension the entire business of preying on people's fears for the sake of self-aggrandizement. This is not a new theme for cinema and it has been done more cleverly and more vehemently before. PK stops short of rejecting religion and instead offers a plea to save faith from those who would exploit it. The story features one devotee who sees through the fraud and walks away, so it is particularly peevish of those claiming to respect that religion to find this movie offensive. Apart from the story of the impostor-guru, the film takes a jab at purveyors of a number of religions, while still allowing for the possibility of genuine faith, as the alien \"PK\" articulates based on his own experience after being away from his home planet, which apparently has no concept of religion.In the end we are asked to discredit those who perpetrate fraud in the name of religion by none other than an alien who has come to research life away from his home planet. With some lovely shots of the landscape, along with confusion over the strange habits of earthlings, a bit of farce and a smattering of romantic comedy that dovetails with the main story, it closes with credits in a fine font and tranquil background.",

After a few people tell him only God can help him get home, the alien develops a transactional concept of human religion, and is continually perplexed by his difficulties in getting one of our wold's many Gods he woos to help him out. While God lets him down, a curious reporter (Anushka Sharma) recovering from heartache comes up with an odd way to help, which involves creating a media war between the alien and a religious leader.The moral of the movie is pretty much, organized religion sucks. Religion is portrayed (and I'm on the filmmaker's side here) as a film- flam that at best takes your money and at worst results in terrorism and war.There are some logic issues here. I'll admit, I'm not Indian, but I think it's at least as religious as America, and if a news station created a platform for an agnostic rabble-rouser here it would not go well for them. But as I say, I don't know much of anything about India, so perhaps they are more open to debate than my local Christians.I'm also not convinced an alien would leap to this particular set of unlikely conclusions, but then, there's no real guarantee aliens would have much intelligence outside of the technological kind.This is a very funny and occasionally touching movie with Khan weird and funny and Sharma perky and lovable. It also has some excellent songs, most notably Love is a Waste of Time, which is the first Indian song I ever found myself humming after the movie ended.If you want to see a silly, anti-(organized)religion movie, this is an excellent choice.",

In PK, these two names synonymous with movies with quality as their trademark symbol come together for the second time in their successful career.PK is a beautifully crafted movie that is totally a different one in terms of story line and with solid performance from Aamir Khan to back it, the film hits the right chord among the audience. Rajkumar Hirani comes up with another film that has fun and entertainment but at the same time try to pass a strong message to the society.Just briefing about the story which i will try my best to ensure that nothing is revealed to act as spoiler. PK ( Aamir Khan) lands up in our world in a desert in Rajasthan and gradually becomes part of our daily life. But he questions the belief and custom we follow in the name of religion, God and human Gods. The rest i am leaving it to you to watch and see for yourself on big screen. The first half concentrates on fun element while the latter half takes a small u turn and gets into a serious mode retaining the fun part.The treatment especially towards the end has definitely shades of the Munnabhai series where the protagonist tries to prove his point to the public but in no way it is a copy or inspired versions of those films. As said, the plot is something unique in its own way that makes a connection with the viewers right from the word go. Rajkumar Hirani on the direction side has done his part and his vision and what he wanted to convey is there on screen crystal clear. His trademark style of narrating a story of victory for goodness and passing good messages to the people is visible in PK as well.On screen, Aamir Khan is the perfect cast as PK. This character is definitely one of his best in his career and PK the movie is driven largely by the sheer screen presence of AK, the actor. He speaks in Bhojpuri language and the dialogue delivery by the actor was too good evoking laughter in us. Anushka Sharma as Jaggu supported Aamir Khan and complimented him in the film's overall perspective. Sushant Singh Rajput in a brief role as Sarfraz was impressive and the same goes for Sanjay Dutt. Boman Irani and Pareekshit Sahni who are the regulars in RKH movies is also part of the cast. Technically the film stands out with good cinematography and smooth cuts. Background score and songs were also good and jelled well with the film. So overall, PK doesn't disappoint and offer a pleasing movie experience with good doses of spoofs, comedy and sentiments. He came and he conquer our hearts and make us think. Yes PK from Rajkumar Hirani with Aamir Khan for me is a must watch film and my personal rating is eight out of ten. Enjoy the fun ride and be ready for a little surprise in the end.",

            "content": "First things first, PK is a 'very good' movie, eminently watchable for the following reasons:\u0095 Very simple message delivered in a \u00a0way that a 10 year - 70 year old would understand\u0095 Has a very universal appeal, excellently blended in a light hearted satire, so craftily that Raju Hirani can be crowned the master of this genre\u0095 Is so much more meaningful than Devgan kicking cars in air, and Salman mouthing Pandeyji lines and Yo Yo singing vodka\u0095 Is still an acceptable relief for an eagerly awaited movie, much more than a Doom 3 or a Happy New YearBut is that good enough to be \"great cinema\". I vehemently deny, for these fundamental problems with PK:1. Performance by lead actors: Much has been talked about this being Aamir's best, method acting, vocabulary learning and all. I thought the performance was good, but hardly anything to compare with much more accomplished and lesser popular actors. I am not even talking Nasir, Balraj Sahni, Dilip Kumar, Nawazuddin. You want 'real' looking performances, go watch any 20 mins of GOW. If you don't know what is GOW, then\u0085.google it :). As for method acting and diction, just google what Ben Kingsley did for Gandhi, or what Daniel Day Lewis does for every movie he acts, or how Pankaj Kapoor a sworn teetotaler did a top drunkards role in Matru, and what Aamir did will look like final year exam of junior acting school.. that's it. Unfortunately the only other serious actor in the movie Saurabh Shukla is such a caricature, he must have done this only for his paycheck..1. Lopsided debate on religion: By choosing to base the debate with Tapasvi, a \u00a0one color character, the director / story writers kind of made it a high school debate competition level discussion. There was no thought process on why so much of this 'religious buffoonery' exists, what extent is 'truly required' in today's times. The risk from such \u00a0debate is, it gets whistles in shows but cannot trigger any intellectual discussion - I doubt it intended to. It was as if the whole system has 1000 wrongs and not even 1 right, and an alien who is completely oblivious to our world's compulsions, complexities, stresses can point answers to it. \u00a01. Tries to pack too much: Good looking people check, media indulgences check, popular jokes check, cross border love check, love story-uniting etc check, terrorist bomb blast check. Great cinema sticks to it's theme and doesn't need love story threads, converged in a stomach- achingly funny climax. Phone call, live, around the globe, discussing personal problems, which has hardly anything to do with the serious theme, sobbing viewers on the Veer-Zara uniting.. Why\u0085Raju, you delivered a masterstroke by making Gandhi current for a whole generation, that was genius. Take a bow for that. But alien showing way of life, was addressed by the Roshans in a series for mentally challenged viewers. Bettering that is not good enough for your calibre. Single theme movie for the 10-70 age bracket, try watching 'Miracle on 34th Street', the best message and movie about Christmas - made in 1947, I bet you will be shocked how relevant it will look to you today.1. \u00a0Very Straight Characters: All characters are one color, like a school play. Bad, good. No complexities in characters. Kind of similar to those college stage skits, which end up with some nice theme and a few sobbing front rows. \u00a0Fundamental flaw there - PK himself confesses he comes from a land where everybody is simple and can read each other's minds. So no lies, no cheating, no deceit, no sin, no bad, no charity, no evil, no nothing.. dear friend, human beings live on this 'gray' not 'black and white' planet where all these realities exist and in abundance. Religion has nothing to do with their existence. How do you know if these complex humans don't need 'any' amount of ritualism/rules. This alien learnt lying and cheating in his short stint, these humans have 5000 years of recorded history to learn non-sense from.Yes the masses won't understand a Garam Hawa, or Satyakam (a masterpiece that deserves much more praise than it got), but do we have to be dished out this simple straight good-bad people talk in the name of 'best movie' of the year.. No please\u00851. Too much of 'Go Watch It': This bothered me so much, that I woke up early on a day when I have a sick off, and keying this :). There were quite a few movies in 2014 that could beat PK black and blue in 'cinematic' value fist fight. Dedh Ishqiya's performances will beat the entire cast of PK - did you know Arshad Warsi \u00a0was born and brought up in Mumbai and Maharashtra. See his Bhopali commentary before you go gaga over the bhojpuri skills of the lead here. Or watch Irrfan's work for Paansingh Tomar - if you want to be wowed with method acting. Haider - delivered a poignant message, with complex characters, and a few of haunting, haunting scenes, that will shake you up (Please do not watch \u00a0pirated print of this gem, theater or HQ prints on large screen only). Tongue in cheek message about jingoism - Total Siyappa did an OK job, and so did Filmistaan. Am yet to watch Citylight, Kya Dilli Kya Lahore, and Bhopal, but am sure the box-office collections of all of them put together will not make the first week of 'go watch it' PK.Please watch PK - passable, good, family movie. But 8.8 on IMDb and 86% on Rotten Tomatoes.. Mediocrity rules I guess, when it comes to popular cinema.",

I am not usually a big fan of Indian movies, but Amir Khan can do and have done better than this...Maybe all these religious problems in the film makes this movie work if you are Indian, but this \"wrong number\" crap that the movies keeps repeating just seems like such a juvenile idea. Do people really believe this stuff and as soon as someone says \"wrong number\" and points out that some gurus prophecy didn't come true the universe suddenly becomes clear to them? What is this movie trying to say? Even after seeing this movie I don't know. Maybe that you shouldn't put too much weight on religion or something, but I think that this message might ring hollow for a lot of people outside of India.",

Recently there was this incident where a supposed god-man hugs women so as to cure their illness, and people from villages just blindly believe him and go to him. This has to stop, people should know these are thugs who have no sense of morals. And a movie like PK addresses just this.

It shakes your belief with unfamiliar perspective. PK is na\u00efve yet smart, simple but has a way to solve complications and a character that you love to love. He came, conquered, learned to love and lie and returns with a naked heartthrob of bollywood. (Watch out for a pleasant surprise in last 30 seconds). It is arguably one of the best performance by Aamir Khan but there is no debate that Anushka Sharma is an ACE in every scene from Bruges to Rajasthan.PK comes from a planet which has neither language nor clothes and a weird dance movement to release the stress. PK's Planet people transit information through human connection (like USB) and hence it surprises PK that humans on earth can communicate with God wirelessly. First half shows PK's curiosity in understanding way of life, making friends, learning Bhojpuri, surviving with smartness, lots of running from angry mob, bunch of na\u00efve questions, funny incidents and an ice cream moment of tears. Second half takes the turn of \"Oh My God\" and questions religions as mediums to reach God. Beauty of PK is the blending of three separate stories of an alien, love triangle and religion and Raju Hirani's execution as Director is top notch.Read complete review @ http://www.ratemovieshere.com/reviews/11445/pk-2014-review",

He forces us to shed all preconceived notions and look at it all from a blank slate. Anushka's acting in the movie is also quite good and she plays the sweet but rebellious girl part quite well. **** SPOILER ALERT below ***** The beginning and end of the movie felt like ET, however I was a bit disappointed - only for the first 5 minutes though - that they could not come up with a more non human looking representation of ET. Instead, it turns out later that Aamir's wide eyed look, his funny airplane like gait and child-like attitude will be more than sufficient.",

            "review_title": "(Wrong number) In Bruges? Really?",
            "content": "Well, I surprised myself by going mainstream this weekend as well (I've been doing that for a while now, but surprise surprise again). The good parts of the movie compensate for the bad parts, but, the bad parts are so overwhelmingly bad that the good ones just pass muster. Like his (Rajkumar Hirani's) Munnabhai movies, and 3 Idiots, this one's also a 'message' movie. Casting Aamir is a stroke of genius (unless this was Aamir's idea in the first place), considering the efforts he makes to be perceived as a socially conscious human being in the public eye (not a bad thing - wish more 'sensible' celebrities were equally/more active in that sphere, more 'responsible', so to speak). However, to start at the beginning, I almost walked out during the first 15/20 minutes since it has some of the most unimaginative romantic interludes, or what passes for such, on any screen, in any language. A complete distraction, and a waste of time even, judging by its eventual denouement towards the end. However, I was kinda glad I decided to stay, since it takes up the subject of organized religion (puzzlingly keeping it divorced from big business and politics, keeping it vanilla, so to speak), and trying to use a 3rd party perspective to shine a light on something that (possibly) the ones within should be doing more actively (and highlighting the complete absence of critical thinking in the masses who are beholden to their respective faiths/disciplines). Now, the way it goes about it is a subtle as a sledgehammer, so perhaps the vanilla-izing might've been required, since the vision from Hirani's camp would have been heavy-handed overall, so perhaps it makes sense? This was kinda surprising too, since he did not exhibit this kind of heavy-handedness with his material (not at the scale that he does over here) in his earlier efforts. A precursor of things to come? I hope not.The good parts? The performance (only the 1, followed by perhaps an affectionate/low-key one by Sanjay Dutt) by the talented, and multi-faceted Aamir. He takes what would have been a difficult role for some, and makes it his own, nudity and all. I only wish the material matched his potential and dedication (should Kiran Rao have written/directed this one instead?). The kind of attention usually provided to his supporting characters in his previous efforts is absent here, other than making a completely unnecessary leading lady part of the narrative. Her complete role, the motivations that drive each of her decisions, did Not belong in this movie. I can only imagine that she was either the producer, or had some clout with the film-making team in order to swing this. Performance-wise, it is as ordinary as the ones she has been known for - loud, brash, without a trace of subtlety (on the other hand, that's perhaps why - since this movie also suffers from the same ailment).There are a few smart moments littered across the cluttered screenplay, with quite a few huge suspension-of-disbelief moments as well, and the latter's a staple of any Indian mainstream effort, so it's kinda surprising that I did not see the makers exactly going overboard with those 'elements'. The sad part? The message gets kinda lost in the mess, and there are gonna be more 'offended' folks from this anyway, so why they did not go all the way (perhaps the way 'Religulous' did) will remain a mystery. A better sequel, perhaps? One can indeed hope.All in all, I'd give it an A for intent, and perhaps a C for effort, with perhaps something like an E for execution. I still say it's worth the effort making that trek to the multiplex.",

            "content": "A big fan of Rajkumar Hirani's (RH) story telling. Purely on the basis of the way a director tells a story and captivates the audience's imagination, I would rate R.H in top 5 in the world.People think directors need to direct in a raw fashion, show gore, violence, abuse, rapes, boring love scenes - to get their point across. This kind of titillation is easy to captivate an audience since we all have animal instinct which is enough to create an impact. This makes the director immediately a global hit and appear someone intelligent.Personally I don't subscribe to the above way of narration. For me a director should be subtle, not too preachy, mix all emotions but among all this, shouldn't lose focus of the hard hitting theme, which the story and the movie was made for.In that sense, PK hit me hard, asked the right questions, made me feel alright, enlightened me in an indirect way and the most important of all, didn't give me a headache ;-) Next is the medium to convey the story. Aamir is the best when it comes to such characters. He understood it very well and delivered it with honesty and passion.I personally liked Saurabh Shukla next, after Aamir. Awesome work. Anushka did what was expected of her and Sushant was the gift wrapping.The Dancing car scenes were an amazing way of ridiculing that action. The songs were true to the story.Where R.H shows his brilliance is in the way he picks an alien character to ridicule some negatives of the society and religion. And also balancing all tense scenes with humor. Also justifies why Aamir was nude in the promos, why the transistor. Beautiful way of using the transistor to record his favorite voice. Also the reason why an alien, is to show how a plain white paper becomes dirty and maligned due to the bad elements of our society. Learns that the way to live is earn money, spend money for corruption, police is crooked, no one will help a tramp! In short, humanity is vanishing.Also kudos to R.H for being a little more bold than OMG director, to poke a bit at other religions too and not only Hinduism. Although still too much Hindu bashing. Could have been more neutral. If at all I had to deduct 1 mark is because I see redundant patterns in R.H's movies which is in this movie too. Also for the OMG movie related mess.If R.H were a Hollywood Director, he would have been glorified more, but sadly many people brand him as a mushy movie maker. Karan Johar should learn from R.H about how to not over do mushy scenes and Farah (apart from learning how to make a movie) should learn how to write comedy scenes. Even the condom related scene doesn't look awkward in this movie.People, just watch this movie for its content and please don't judge R.H too much because this guy means good and does good work and one of the few people for whom Money is not everything.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsRajkumar Hirani has done it again, yet another instant classic from this master-auteur. Having proved himself as the undisputed king of satire films with erstwhile classics such as the \"Munnabhai\" series and \"3 Idiots\", Hirani's name can now be drawn in the same breath as Chaplin and Capra - the original legends of this genre - after \"PK\".The film is a hilarious satire of ideas about a stranger in the city, who asks questions that no one has asked before. They are innocent, childlike questions, but they bring about catastrophic responses. People who are set in their ways for generations, are forced to reappraise their world when they see it from PK's innocent eyes. In the process PK makes loyal friends and powerful foes; mends broken lives and angers the establishment. P. K.'s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies, especially those of the religious kind. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter, and letting go. Finally, it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers from worlds apart.Hirani is one of the few men in world cinema who's still stoking the flames of this dying genre, and with each passing release delivers an explosion on-screen that lasts with us a lifetime. In that vein, PK is quite similar to his previous efforts wherein he smartly conceals an open-ended and relevant social message behind innovatively conceived gags and dollops of genuine humor, with the only disparity or rather drawback being that the film has a few albeit negligible portions, which seem to stall the screenplay and jar the proceedings. While Hirani's prior offerings were utterly peerless, one could find minor flaws with \"PK\" if they wanted to really nitpick, which could result in the film being slotted a rung or two below the Director's first three movies. But with such a fabulous screenplay, brilliant background score, stunning camera-work, and most of all, masterful direction, these flaws could easily be overlooked.The ensemble cast too, pulls off a fantastic job, as is always the case with a Hirani film where all the actors \u2013 main or bit players \u2013 seem to feed off each other, with Anushka, Shukla, and above all Aamir being the standout performers. While there's no doubt that Aamir always performs his roles well, after ages (the last time being \"Rang De Basant\" way back in 2006), his performance comes across as fresh, non-repetitive, and truly remarkable.\"PK\" is vehemently and irrefutably the most engaging Bollywood film this year, providing wholesome entertainment; carrying brave, bold themes, and holding immense repeat value. If you haven't watched the film yet, you're missing out on something special.",

Rajkumar Hirani, after 5 years down the line with 3 idiots, comes with a religious satire from which our country and country people are suffering.Nice script, good direction and all well-fitted characters in the film. This winter, PK will surely do the best as eye-opener towards the religion in country and their manager's true stories, which is always hidden from blind devotees. Go and watch for sure this weekend.For more detailed review of the movie: www.getmovieinfo.com/movie-review-pk-aamir-khan-anushka-sharma/",

In short, I have grown up watching Rajkumar Hirani films. And every film he directs, he has a new story to tell. A new message to deliver. Gives a new reason to make us smile.As a space-ship lands in the desert in Rajasthan, P.K (Aamir Khan) is unaware of this new world. As destined to be, Jaggu (Anushka Sharma) meets P.K who is in search of something. (Watch the film to know). And rest of the proceedings form the story. No doubt, P.K is Rajkumar Hirani's most accomplished work but it also deals with a prominent issue that resides in our society.I must say the story is indeed very difficult to present it in a form of media. But Rajkumar Hirani has presented it in a very entertaining way. This proves this guy can do the impossible. His trade-mark can be seen all over the motion. If Munnabhai had 'Jadoo Ki Jhappi & Gandhigiri.', 3 Idiots had 'Aal Izz Well.' P.K has 'Wrong Number.' You will understand this when you watch the film.Dialogues are witty and humorous. One Line is like 'Jo Darr gaya, Woh Mandir Gaya'. WOW! Those aren't the cheesy dialogues normally a bollywood film has. The emotional scenes will surely bring tears to your eyes.Coming to the performances, P.K is Aamir Khan's best film till date. He has done total justice to the character and I don't think that anybody else could have matched him up. He has done Wonders! Don't miss the debate scene in the 2nd half which is sure to bring tears. Anushka Sharma as Jaggu is phenomenal. As P.K's only friend she never brought a dull moment in the film. Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla, Sushant Singh Rajput are great in their parts. Don't miss Ranbir Kapoor's cameo.Music by Shantanu Moitra is good. Bhagwan Hai Kahan Re Tu is my pick of the lot because the song made me silent.On the whole, P.K is an eye-opener. It is a film that is not be watched only for entertainment but also for re-checking your lifestyle, changing the vision towards the society. Thank you Rajkumar Hirani, Aamir Khan, Abhijat Joshi and the entire team for such a lovely film. Discover love. Discover Life. Discover GOD! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! P.S:- Pop out your ears. Open your eyes wide. Be P.K! Watch it Now. It is URGENT!",

Even if I did not go to church this Holy Thursday, the realizations I made and the blessings I received were enough. Sure, there were a lot of concepts on the verge of being cringe-y but they never showed a hint of hesitation and embarrassment. What anyone could feel was the immense level of mastery each had to observe to make all the elements- directing, photography, writing, music, dance, acting- work perfectly. Everything was on point, to say the least.As a Catholic in a highly conservative country, this hit too close to home. I practice my faith like most people do but I wouldn't say I'm as devout as others. All the questions PK raised and practices confronted were valid. And I think about them ever since I was young. I felt seen that this has already transcended as an extension of my principles. The real challenge for me now is to keep on calling or else I would never know if it's the correct or wrong number at all. It wouldn't hurt as well to call out the propagators of hatred now that the world is getting more discriminatory and violent by the day. It's awful but it gives me hope that this kind of art exists for everyone to reflect upon. It might be a film today but who knows it might be the universal practice tomorrow- or in the near future. I can only pray or anticipate the next alien landing.",

Some lines and scenes that has touched me are -1. Love if was such, holding the hand, you would know the feelings going on in the heart of yours love, you would find million of way to make him/her happy.. (Scene - Aamir knows Anuskha's secret after holding her hand)2. Believe the god who created us, not the god whom we created. (Scene- during the climax scene \"Ek Sawal aur\")3. Love and romance are limited to inside room closing the door but war and violence are open in the public. (last dialouge)4. A person's image has also no value unless money comes (Scene- Aamir trying to make exchange with Gandhi photo)5. Ultimately truth will disappear no matter what is your effort. (Scene- Aamir lying he doesnot love Anushka )and a funny line just for fun-6.

            "content": "As Bollywood's slapstick brigade laughed its way to the bank in a year that saw extremes in cinema, one remembers only the handful that stood against the tide and provided some freshness with genuine storytelling. In a last among them, a stranger finds himself in an awkwardly complex land with subjective attitudes to cultural philosophies that simply do not make sense to him. Yes, he is an alien (But not of the Jadoo variety). Because only an alien can actually look at things objectively on a gola where questioning age-old systems means sacrilege. He is critical of the general norm and challenges the religion managers with child-like questions whose answers might send tremors across the general cultural beliefs. Rajkumar Hirani isn't new to breaking the stereotype and changing perceptions. With 'Munnabhai' and 'Rancho' having influenced a generation in their own way, he now faced the challenge of accusing religious leaders of connecting people to a 'wrong number' with God. He had to often ridicule common practices, rattle faith and yet remain inoffensive to each religion in a country that boasts of its diversity. Hirani's genius solution was to have an alien look at this from a child- like perspective and question our common sense and conscience. Optimistically, the result will alter the way a billion people waste gold, money, milk and sundry products in age old superstitions that are commanded by the fear of uncertainty. Pessimistically, these billion will simply erupt in guffaws provoked by PK's outrageous learning process while munching on their expensive popcorn. PK's (Aamir Khan) only means of returning home was stolen from him the moment he arrived in the remoteness of Rajasthan. Barely learning mankind's basic ways in perhaps the most hilarious ways in recent memory, he encounters Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt) who fails to understand this unique character but indirectly helps him learn bhojpuri. Now, with language as his effective tool, PK travels to Delhi in search of the thief who stole his device. Through various sources, he is recommended to follow the path of God, who would offer a solution to his problem. This is when PK is confronted with several Gods among diverse religions that sometimes have the opposite principles. Through rigorous devotion to his cause of searching for the one who could help him, PK realizes that God wasn't answering because of the wrong connection with his devotees. Aided in his quest to change people's views about God by a TV journalist, Jaggu (Anushka Sharma), he dares to correct the iconic servant of God, Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla). What ensues in Rajkumar Hirani's well written script is a delicate walk along the line of pragmatism and self belief. This is most certainly among Aamir Khan's best films. With his wide open eyes and flappy ears, he is constantly observing and learning to adapt to a strange land. His child- like viewpoint of life around him on the gola is portrayed convincingly along with his frustrations, confusions and deliberations. His objective view of things we do on a day-to-day basis in a subjective manner is what prompts the best dialogues, performances and comedy in the film. The dialogues of course, are funnier because of him speaking in bhojpuri. Anushka Sharma uses her charm to complement Aamir Khan's eccentric character and while she naturally enjoys his comedy, she guards her recent heartbreak from an episode in Belgium. Her energy is consistent throughout and that is perhaps her strength as an actress. Sushant Singh Rajput impresses in his brief role while Boman Irani is outstanding as the media mogul who is keen to avenge the trishul attack on him. Parikshit Sahni's depiction of a stubborn religious follower is quite a treat from one of the most under-rated supporting actors. Bhairon Singh's brevity on screen was definitely inadequate and we realize how well Sanjay Dutt complements Hirani's form of storytelling in any character. Saurabh Shukla's Tapasvi Maharaj is the manipulative hypocrite whose ego and lies reflect much of what is wrong with religion now. He is excellent in the debate scene with PK where his demeanor even sets doubts in our minds about the outcome. Music by Ajay-Atul and Shantanu Moitra is reminiscent of Hirani's previous films. Refreshing and catchy with smooth melodies such as chaar kadam which has Shaan at his best. Waste of time is catchy enough to linger in our minds with its happy theme.Rajkumar Hirani isn't out the change the world. But he is certainly enabling us to. PK only speaks his mind and looks at the world like a child but his struggle with making sense of the world is what we relate to. PK's questioning of the cultural norms and religious bigotries doesn't aim for sacrilege. It instead enables us to pursue what we believe in purely, without any influencing factors. The disbelief of the alien's existence quickly gets discarded by the script's intention to use him as a manifestation of an outsider, cutting through the layers of complexities we have surrounded our cultures with. Then there's the adroitly crafted Sarfaraz-Jaggu love story that seems like an odd deviation for a while, till it so heart-warmingly falls into the satire. There's so much beauty in PK and none of it relates to scenery, actor's bodies, slapstick comedy and over-acting. It's all in the writing and dialogues where it makes so much sense. This is an intelligently made film that took Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra 5 years to make (along with other projects) and the effort is completely justified when the audience nods with PK in appreciation of his views and rolls out of their seats while laughing at the brilliantly executed barber scene. PK and his friend are going to be one alien duo we will eagerly be waiting to welcome on to our gola. 9.222 on a scale of 1-10.",

He doesnt know what to do and when he asks folks for help they tell him to pray to god. So he spends the entire movie looking for god. He joins every religion and follows all their customs to talk to god but he still couldn't get his communicator back. As he was about to give up he meets a reporter who realizes he is telling the truth so she tries to help him. He has a real weird view on life on earth so she uses that to push a story about the alien who was challenging the religious leaders because he felt that their connection to god was hijacked by a prankster. So he tries to help the priests by exposing the pranksters illogical suggestions. Its pretty funny and pokes fun of a lot of religious practices that really are hilarious to watch though at the same time, its sad to think that anyone believes in them in the 21st century. There are a few music pieces in this and they were also fun and not very distracting from the comedy.All that said, I gave it an 8 because it is not flawless. A lot of the arguments made are actually pretty well known so there was nothing new except the funny mimes and the aliens behavior. The real issue is the plot hole that materialized towards the end. It could have been handled in a much smarter way but still, this is a comedy so it really shouldnt be taken so seriously hence my high grade.If you dont usually watch foreign subtitled movies, this is a great one to start with... you are missing a lot of great stuff if you dont.",

He teams up with Vinod Chopra, Abhijat Joshi & Amir Khan, and made pk after 3 idiots. 3 idiots was a cult movie. This film is also fabulous, but, as per my concern, not better than the previous. This film reminds us Akshay Kumar-Paresh Rawal starrer OMG!Oh My God. But I must say that pk is better. The story, screenplay, dialogues, acting, songs, music, direction, locations- everything is too good. What to say about Amir Khan, he is damn good as pk, an alien. It is very difficult to act like him with fully open eyes, & even without blinking. Anushka Sharma looks so pretty. It was her best performance at all. Sanjay Dutt, Saurabh Shukla, Shushant Singh Rajput & Boman Irani - all the actors performed really well. Music is outstanding. Nanga-Punga dost, Tharki Chokro, Love is waste of time & Bhagvan - all these songs are written beautifully and composed brilliantly. Music composer is Shantanu Moitra and Ajay-Atul & lyricist is Swanand Kirkire. Rajkumar Hirani is baap of all directors in this decade. He can engage public with social message and very unique and laugh out laugh comedy. I laughed so much during the film. And I became emotional in the climax. Totally emotional and very touchy climax, even unpredictable, I'm sure many of you may have tears in their eyes in the climax. Abhijat Joshi & Rajkumar Hirani's extraordinary story, concept & dialogues make the film a worth watch at any cost. Whatever the price of the theater is, you can definitely spend the money on it.

There are times when we just laugh constantly and funny punches keep coming one after the other. No worries in the acting department as Amir has handled everything perfectly. Anushka looks cute, as always and has done her part well. Sanjay Dutt is quite a surprise. His presence on the film marked sure laughter.

            "content": "I avoided all the hype surrounding this movie, and instead waited until it was on Netflix, four years after its release. I am glad I didn't spend my hard earned money on this piece of trash.There is a song from the 1959 movie \"Dhool ka Phool\", which goes as \"Tu Hindu Banega Na Musalman Banega, Insaan Ki Aulaad Hai Insaan Banega\", the gist of which is \"One is just a human being irrespective of his/her religious upbringing\". The movie takes this idea and stretches into a 2.5 hour worth of torture.The movie borrows its opening from \"The Terminator\", where an alien is sent to earth and hence, is completely naked. The rest of the movie is just the message \"All religions are absurd, all humans are same\" hammered again and again, until one looks forward for the movie to end.On his planet, the alien can communicate with fellow planet-people just by touching each other. Yet, this alien has the ability of vision, speech and hear sounds. We will let the evolutionary biologists discuss the intricacies of such evolutionary abnormality.The movie uses all the tired cliches to drive its pointForeign locales - check\nBoy-girl romance - check\nIndo-Pak relationship - check\nHindu-Muslim love - check\nComedy - check\nEmotions - check\nDysfunctional father - daughter relationship - checkSome of the events in movie take place in Bruges. I still don't understand what Bruges had to do with entire movie. Those events could have happened in Bombay or Karachi and could have still been relevant.Bollywood is not very well-known for being subtle in its movies, and this movie is no exception. In every scene, we are reminded about the inconsistency between the religious beliefs and religion being of no relevance to daily living.Acting wise - every major actor seems to think that one has to over act-over emote to be known as good actor. Nothing is normal - everything is over-the-top in the movie. Aamier wears a permanent exclamation on his face - yes Aaamir, we get it - you cannot understand the way people function on the planet. But I thought that after spending few weeks in Delhi, you might get used to the absurdity of life - at least an intelligent person would.Anyway, the movie appealed to masses and has raked in millions. So at this point, finding faults with this movie is moot. But if you still haven't watched movie, do yourself a favour, and instead spend time with your loved ones, pursue a hobby or just enjoy the life. You will be much happier.",

Ranbir Kapoor in the end scene was a pleasant surprise. the tracks and background music may not seem that soothing but fit perfectly in the movie and carry forward the narration. overall, the movie makes for a decent watch especially our very own Bhojpuri PK ..",

Stopping short of making the movie against religion, the director has used wonderfully crafted 'happy-go-lucky' character against the ever-increasing Godmen and Godwomen in India. Of late, in the Indian social scenarios many news have been mushrooming about the miscreants who pretend as 'mediators' to the omnipotent. Aamir Khan has, predictably, has carried the film. The Bhojpuri accent has given a slightly light-hearted twist but doesn't distract from the crux. Some side-plots, however, seemed pointless: notably, Sanjay Dutt and the 'informer'.

Its Aamir KHAN all the way, he didn't look like Aamir Khan and had eyes wide OPEN ALL THE time and his pointy ears. He kept running all the time like a Lunatic although he was not. He portrayed innocent stupidity that was not actually stupid but people prefer to call these as not up to his senses and sensibilities.

If you are correlating it with reality then surely aliens cannot be ruled out from having a systematic and complete language for communication because it is the pillar of any highly developed civilization. So I would say science background viewers may find it a little obscure. Emotion is the USP of this movie as always pioneered by our bollywood.

It is nice to see an acclaimed director and actor doing social satire, but I felt if they had done it in more subtle way, it would have been better. Story goes on monotonously attacking religious rituals and god men. It could be relevant. But there are other movies in bollywood and regional cinema which done a better job. The director took very mature efforts to express his social views in previous attempts. He made us to reflect upon our health care system in 'Munna bhai MBBS' and educational system in '3 idiots'. As we watch the film we realize this time his target is some religious practices. Everything is okay, but it is very peripheral and rather biased. What is the need for sub plots with Muslim character from Pakistan? Come on man, if you want to express concerns of 'Islamophobia' let me remind that India has a larger Muslim population and he very well could have been from India. I feel it was simply included to appease viewers from Pakistan. Music and back ground score is mediocre. The film may have actors with caliber, but this film is not their best. I don't find anything exceptional in Amir khan's portrayal of alien. I am surprised to see so many praises expressed for this movie made and acted by some talented people.But it is sad that people give in to hero worshiping, when the movie itself talks against irrational worship.",

            "review_title": "PK travels his journey, and invites you to go on yours",
            "content": "PK is a film that has up till now, been long anticipated by the Indian and Indo-phile public. The creative marriage of director Rajkumar Hirani and seasoned actor Aamir Khan has already given birth to the prodigious '3 Idiots,' and audiences are curious to whether their newest child is equally as gifted. With artisans as quality-oriented about their work as this pair is, one expects to see something beyond the average. Upon seeing the movie, the audience can expect that it is certainly no average movie; it proves to be a thoroughly enjoyable and provocative experience, that invites - rather than commands - you to discover a deeper meaning for yourself in its resolution.The story is about a strange man on a strange quest that seems totally sane to him, yet that cannot but seem delirious to nearly everyone else (hence his name 'Peekay' or 'drunkard'). His frantic manner and child-like ignorance results in humorous and baffling episodes which give him deeper insight into the working of the world, and he generally polarizes: people either warm up to him, or chase him away (the latter provides much of the comic relief in the movie). Yet he remarkably manages to transform almost every person he meets; he himself, however, has an untainted aloofness that invites any curious soul to investigate him further. A few take the bait, and find themselves learning as much about their own selves as they do about their quirky new friend. Soon PK's journey, which started out a very personal one, becomes quite impersonal and then interpersonal as he invites not only his new friends, but also society itself into the provocative workings of his mind and ultimately, his heart - and challenges them to go into their own.Aamir Khan is, unsurprisingly, at his top form here. While the other actors give great performances, it is clearly Khan's that really gives the film it's life force. His genius is his ability to deliver a performance so nuanced, and with so much carefully crafted flavor and subtetly, yet that never loses it's organic and natural feeling. The character of PK is outwardly stiff and rigid as reflective of his strange origin, and yet when he needs to be can be so captivatingly expressive that you can feel every nuance of his feeling, and you can almost think the unpredictable thoughts as he cranks them out in his mind. Part of PK's appeal is that you expect him to be offbeat, which on the surface he very much is, yet he amazes you with a sane humanity that bursts forth as spontaneous insight from his bewildering mind. If you can keep up with him, he takes you along for the ride: his charisma is electric, unstoppable in a way that doesn't hint that he'll run you over, but that invites you to run along with him (if you don't mind others staring at you).Jaggu, played zestfully by Anushka Sharma, does just that. She is a wonderfully composite girl: as fresh-faced as the girl-next-door, yet as independent as a woman who yearns to play life by her own rules. She is drawn to PK because like him, she is lost. The complexity of her romantic life with a humble lover (endearingly acted by Sushant Singh Rajput) proves to become a pivotal part of her and PK's personal and collective understanding. Jaggu's real-world charm and practicality provides a wonderful counterbalance to PK's otherworldly insight; the two are often played off each other, and a delightfully intimate friendship is born.The other characters round out a respectable cast. Sanjay Dutt as the well-dressed Bhairon Singh is another colorful character who does well to offer his own unique perspective on PK. Saurabh Shukhla as the morally ambiguous guru is quite convincing; Boman Irani, as Jaggu's reluctant boss proves instrumental in helping PK on his journey. A sweet character is Sushant Singh Rajput's Sarfaraz, Jaggu's humble lover whose story with her could well be its own movie - it is a shame that he doesn't get as much screen time as he could have.The beauty of this film is that, like most great movies, it works on many levels. When it's funny and lighthearted, it keeps you laughing for long stretches of time; when it's emotional or serious, it really gets you to pause. A lot of times, the humor itself is woven into making serious points, in a way that bespeaks the great talent of this director and his writers. The film tackles subject matter that could easily offend (religion) with an innocence that commands insight. The PK writers have woven a charmingly unique story that respects, not dumbs-down, the intelligence of the Indian (or any) viewer.Overall, PK the movie is a lot like PK the character: Strangely alarming, yet innocently inviting, and thoroughly enjoyable. The few shallow plot elements are smoothed by a very cleverly written script. Visually, PK is a marvel. Clearly, Hirani and his cinematographers spared no expense when composing the visual tone; there is not a drab sari, dhoti, turban, or uniform to be found. Like he did in '3 Idiots,' Hirani has proved that he has a real knack for taking everyday elements of life and creating a story so intriguing that any viewer can appreciate it at their own level, and perhaps a higher one if they accept the invitation. This is not your average masala flick; this is a thought-provoking reflection on society, wrapped in a charming story of a man trying to find his way. When and if PK finds his way home, you can be sure that the audience will have worked out mentally and emotionally if they are ready at that point to join him. The beauty is that Hirani and Khan never force you to choose, but allow your own acceptance to unfold at its own pace, as all great films do.",

            "content": "This was a needed wake-up call for our Indian Sub-Continent, its stuck-up culture that has been mostly mistaken as religions. PK is an inspirational learning experience for the audience it means to affect.By taking a concept that is considered controversial, to some extent taboo and secretive for the cause of secular integration and religious sensitivity, the film, instead of either alienating or defending, goes on and explores, exploits and appreciates- discussions, debates, dictates and deliberations on religion its interpretations and misinterpretations, how history and community have affected the growth of GOD REALIZATION within man and how human life has been subjected to negligence due to the spreading tentacles of religious practices and policies to observe submission to God instead of fulfilling the purpose of being happy This was an actually neutral view without being either offensive, or defensive or for that case protective towards various superstitions and radicalism that comprise of religions since the 12th century. It also celebrates GOD, his/her oneness and his/her affiliation to human life and happiness as the path to peace. Its a classic novel in motion form. Its like writing A Tale of Two Cities a subtle expression of a very serious matter. A strong point of the film is that it sticks to its own strengths and concepts without pondering or wandering into unspecified territories.Raju Hirani does it again, his unique ability to play with a concept without making it violent and sorrowfully morbid. His ability to handle surreal concepts with such grace is applaud-able. Aamir Khan seemed to be at his traditional ease. Anushka Sharma ended up being a good selection, this also means that powerhouses are breaking away from Kareena Kapoor. Sushan Rajput and Sanjay Dutt did not have a very powerful role to be mentioned in here but they did play the roles specified justly. The film being from the Raju Hirani School of Art brings along a lot of new trends and culture including music used in the movie that is path breaking and beautiful. In a time when we have been fans of Anurag Kashyap school of real art, and other have been fans of bogus trend-isms of Yash Raj and Karaj Johar Romances its the talent of Hirani that begs to differ with their surreal and yet so beautiful art works and prove that it does not have to be hard hitting violent and sordid and morbid or for that case so close to reality and yet so damningly unreal in its romantic approach to be called artistic, a beautiful rendition can be perfectly weighed as this film. People like Guru Dutt and Hrishikesh Mukherji would have been so proud of the team. Lastly, if you are going into the theatre with expectations that it would as grand or entertaining as a 3 Idiot be prepared to be slightly disappoint cause this movie is more about the morale while that film was more about the story and rooted in reality.",

            "content": "PK is a movie about an alien visiting earth who lands in India. Unfortunately the radio device through which he could send signal is grasped and taken away by somebody, in short stolen. The journey to find this device is accommodated with help of various events, the alien thinks the people of earth know about their creator well and prays for his device. He prays to various Gods of all religions. The alien falls in love with a women who works for media. He further finds she loves somebody else and supports her in meeting him again gradually gaining his device again.The portrayal of pundit in movie made me think was he really a psychic? If yes, then the device he stole was for his further improvement of some kind. Even if it was still it would have been wrong. It might be possible for pundit as a psychic to be influenced by negative energies, thus such a nature. I personally liked the aliens nature of belief in God. The movie gains a negative mark for hurting my sentiments even if it was little.Humor element is handled nicely in Rajkumar Hirani's films. The alien concept could have handled better as I feel intelligent life would come with some sort of clothing sense. Felt numb in 2 scenes: condom scene and a romantic one. PK's construction of curious nature, makes it great overall. Fairly recommended.",

It also brightened the focus on people's point-of-view towards different Religions. Didn't get bored with this movie. he 1st half was full of pace and some memorable scenes. 2nd half started off a little slowly with a couple of stretched scenes (that had no need of). But it again picked up pace and headed towards the Climax with lots more drama, laughter and excitement. For me, it's one of the Best executed films i have seen recently. Enjoyed the full time. Sunshat & Boman were good in their respective small roles. PK is a Trademark Rajkumar Hirani Film written all over it with Laughter, Emotions, Drama & an important Message.",

Honestly, I had more expectations from Aamir - Hirani movie so that is the reason I would not give it a 8 star. Also it doesn't have any memorable songs or scenes.

            "content": "It may be just me, but I watch movies simply for entertainment. A little subtle moralizing is fine, but this one has overdone it, IMO.I have enjoyed 3 Idiots - I consider it one of the best movies of all time in any language. That story had a morale, sure, but it was subtle and did not hinder the pure entertainment value of the movie.This movie started off well and with a unique scenario. Hollywood has done so many expensive alien movies that I was looking forward to the Great Khan's take on aliens. Indianizing cosmic aliens would have been very entertaining for me. The movie had some unique ideas - learning Bhojpuri from a cute prostitute, the different-styled music etc. This was also the second movie where I liked Anushka Sharma's appearance. The first was that Shahrukh Khan flopper, Rab ne etc.However, the movie disappointed me. It just had too much religion for me. Even anti- religion is still religion. We have enough of that in this country, on the roads, at work, in the neighbourhoods and in the terrorism. When I am watching a movie, I want to forget all that nonsense and just enjoy a movie.This movie had potential to be extremely enjoyable - I wouldn't even have minded a bit of religious stuff if Aamir had given us some more alien stuff. But just too much religion for me - you could just remove the alien motif, and replace that with a smart child, or a foreigner etc, and the movie would still be logical. The alien motif was not central, religious moralizing was - that is the heart of what I don't like.Compare this to that beautiful Satyajit Ray short movie - Banku Babu's Friend - and you will see what I mean. That movie influenced Hollywood greats like Spielberg and the Alien movie series. This one will only make money and be quickly forgotten.Better luck next time, Aamir. I still love you as Ranchoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chanchad aka Fungshuk Wangdoo. Rancho has no parallel in world cinema.",

Seeing 8+ ratings, I was mislead to believe that this is a well made and thoughtful movie. Since there are a ton of other good movies that carry 8+ ratings on IMDb, and deserve it, PK certainly doesn't fall into that category.**Spoilers**1. Predictable - within a couple of minutes, any intelligent movie goer would be able to predict that when the lead actress received a letter that was not signed, it is indeed not for her. She doesn't call this person, the other person doesn't call her and then everything just vines together during a live TV show. 2. An alien species that knows how to build space ships, will hang a remote on the person going for a first contact to an alien land, instead of somehow embedding it into the person's body. In clear view. Up for grabs by the first ruffian the alien comes by. This is an insult to intellectual movie enthusiasts.3. What was the objective of the alien? Just to get his remote stolen and then find it? You get one chance to connect with another species, and then you waste it by crying about a lost remote. Further, the concept of God is something that the alien suddenly not only understand, but starts believing in (during the TV show, he makes a comment about this). I am going off the rails here.Of course, the movie was about delivering a message, but when you are about to gross INR 500 Crores (something that 99.99% of the Indian population hasn't even seen), isn't it worth it to put extra efforts to come up with a better and intelligent vehicle to deliver it?I applaud the Indian public for seeing past all these deficiencies and focusing on the message.

The movie says that the message is that there is a God who created us. There's another God that we create that we use for our own selfish needs.It's a rather unique and poignant message. The funniest bit is probably when he's chasing the guy dressed as Shiva. I guess India can be critical of religion too. A lot of this movie was told in flashback just like \"3 Idiots\". I hear they're made by the same director so that figures. It took me awhile to understand the title.He's called Tipsy which translates to PK in Hindi. The joke is that everyone thinks he's drunk. I regret to inform everyone that my depression while watching movies hasn't gotten better. Then again, as I've seen and reviewed every movie I can find on YouTube, I'd probably stop watching movies every day anyway. I'll still review movies in theaters and episodes of TV shows.

Acting wise everyone did fair job. Anushka looks fresh and Shushant fits into his tiny romantic role. Aamir did OK job but we have seen him in so many movies that he doesn't appear as different.

            "content": "5 years back 3 Idiots had become highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time. And it deserved it being a really wonderful film. I know Box Office numbers are not a measure of how good a movie is but it surely indicates the taste of people. In the last few years Box Office Record in India have been continuously broken by one film after another generating immense hype. But this hype was generated by nothing but the Film-star name attached with film or cashing in with dumb sequels of good movies. May it be the the silly Chennai Express or absurd Kick, lame Krrish 3 or abomination of Dhoom 3, none of these stupid Blockbusters deserved such hype. It almost made me lose faith in Bollywood and the number of Bollywood movies I watched started dropping. But then I saw PK and saw it smashing the records of all those films. This movie convinced me Bollywood can still give box office hits which are actually worth the money.Well enough with box office collection talk.Director and Writer Rajkumar Hirani has always delivered be it Munnabhai or 3 Idiots. His movies apart from being absolutely hilarious also have a nice social message. PK is another such gem. The story follows the adventures of an unknown guy going only by initials PK (Aamir Khan), he asks innocent questions and is very curious about the world around him. I wont spoil anything as I want you to get surprised by this thrilling ride. Aamir Khan has given his best performance till date and proves that he is not called Mr.Perfectionist for no good reason. His expression, emotions and induction of innocence into the character of PK is mesmerizing. You instantly fall in love PK and his antics. Another such performance comes to mind is Ranbir Kapoor as Barfi, such heart-winning performances and characters. Anushka Sharma also is excellent as a journalist. Sanjay Dutt,Boman Irani and Sushant Singh Rajput were a delight to watch despite having relatively smaller roles. But the main engine of train Aamir Khan, just cant stop praising him. Definitely best performance of the year followed closely by Shahid Kapoor in 'Haider'.The first half was like a refreshing breeze filled with comic and laugh-out-loud moments. And its not slapstick and lame comedy, but a smart and innovative funny script. The language of Bhojpuri is also used which has its own zing.Towards the middle the movie takes up on religious issues like 'Oh My God'. There is also lot of protest and boycotting going on as the film supposedly hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. Its really sad to see people forgetting morality and humanity, which is the core message the film tries to deliver. We are all humans first and no one should forget that. The film looses steam in second becoming a bit repetitive and takes a bit too serious tone and the shift isn't much gradual. But the ending is excellent and has a surprising cameo by one of my favorite actors. The music and songs are very pleasant and they suit the atmosphere perfectly. One of the songs 'Bhagwan Kahan Hai Tu' was beautifully shot and was really heart-touching. The movie isn't perfect but its positives get brilliantly highlighted.In the end, I would like to thank Rajkumar Hirani for giving us this wonderful treat and Aamir Khan for his heart-touching performance. PK is not Hirani's best but its a welcome film into big money grossing films of Bollywood where most films have the least substance. Watch it now people, because its worth the money.RATING: [3.5/5]",

I always had great admiration towards this guy for his intellectual thought which he often blends up with some waggish way of story telling. All his movies had some messages and it's completely up to the audience whether to just relish the odd two plus hours or to go to the depth of script and dig up the message fossilized in it.Performance wise, it was Aamir all the way. Yet again he emphasized why he is knowing as the perfectionist of Bollywood. Yeah, it was one hell of a performance. Eccentric at the same time emotive. The way he synchronized with bhojpuri language really astonished me. Anushka was good as usual. Rest of the casts comprising Boman Irani, Sanjay Dutt, Saurabh Shukla etc etc did a neat job as well. On technical part, the DOP was outstanding and tickling BGM really could buzz the experience more. Songs were strictly average, in fact none could gain my heed.I strongly recommending this movie to each and every member out here since the relevance of this script is too damn high in current social scenarios . Some of the questions asked by PK really could quiver my intellectual thoughts. And end of the day PK became my one of the favorite character for his innocence and adorable curiosity.",

Nothing amusing this time. - No character development (at all). - Jokes and humor (give me a break) - If you have good eyes then you will notice a bad CG.

            "content": "PK is an exceptional movie. It has a story with a believable fairy tale premise that goes forward and becomes a philosophical one on God and the oneness of all religions with no sign of being preachy. It has humour, romance, affection, heart- warming moments, goose bump inducing scenes and a logic that you cannot fault. It has an idea going viral and the common man becoming an activist. In short a Rajkumar Hirani classic. And like the Munnabhai movies and 3 Idiots these go right into your DVD collection to be watched multiple times. He can put a point across gently and humorously and that is a rare gift indeed.PK is an alien from another planet whose remote device which can take him back home gets stolen the moment he arrives on Earth His efforts to find it take him on a journey where he makes friends, learns about God and the hypocrisy of religion and also fall in love with a TV reporter Jaggu who helps him in his quest.The start cast excels. Amir as PK sports a Bhojpuri accent and random clothes. He has ears and eyes that pop out and yet he manages to show emotion on that exaggerated face. Anoushka is bubbly yet vulnerable though her mouth look like a goldfish. But she is in step with Amir and that's what matters. Saurabh Shukla's Godman is superbly underplayed. Sushant Singh is cute; Boman is Boman and Parikshit Sahni as Jaggu's dad is sweet. Sanjay Dutt as the Rajasthani man who first befriends PK stands out. I would have loved to see more of him in the movie.I would have just wished for a bit more information on the planet that the alien comes from. We know they don't wear clothes there and mind read but apart from that we don't know much. Do they have families? are they as emotional? What do they eat? Some more information would have fleshed out the alien more but that is a minor quibble.The songs are melodious, the dances sweet and simple, the humour spot on and the message of the movie seeps into you gently yet so strongly that the audience was wildly clapping at all the right spots.A review for a good movie always runs the danger of being too gushy and mushy in it's praise. I'll cut the hyperbole. Just know it's a wonderful movie and that you have to see it. Must take kids.",

In the beginning we are introduced to an unnamed alien who has come to earth to see what life on the planet is like. But then his remote gets stolen and he has to learnt to adapt to the lifestyle of humans.He is very confused about the way humans live. He can't understand the purpose behind clothes, money, language, gestures and finally, religion. And that's where I have a problem with this movie. Don't get me wrong. I'm not gonna talk those \"why is only one religion being talked about\" arguments. Rather my problem is why is religion being given so much emphasis? If I were to make this movie, I'd focus more on the people's lifestyle, which is exactly what the movie was going with and occasionally tries coming back to (like the condom scene).The songs, the acting, the colour palette, everything about the visual and audio was fantastic. The scene in which Jaggu wants to come out of jail made me pause the video so that I could laugh properly. The problems come up in the second half, where the sense of humour suddenly finishes and it starts turning more dramatic. The serious scenes don't hit the same way as the comedy scenes do. After all, we are watching a movie about an alien adjusting to earth's lifestyle. It should have a lot more humour than a grim, gritty feeling.It was fun to watch, but I don't see myself watching this ever again. I know it won't be as funny on seeing the second time. And that's why I'd only recommend it to you if you aren't the \"religion good\" type and can actually see a movie with an open mind, because nowadays a lot of negativity is being spread about this movie.",

The supporting cast, which include Hirani favorites like Boman Irani and Sanjay Dutt are fantastic as well. The plot develops swiftly throughout the movie, with clever humor and original writing. While P.K. does share a common theme with the Paresh Rawal starrer Oh My God, it's story is completely different and it brings a fresh perspective on a very controversial and fascinating subject. Cinema such as this must be rewarded in a year where Aamir Khan's counterparts have delivered nonsensical products like Happy New Year and Kick, P.K. is a breathe of fresh air. Don't miss it!",

Innocence put forward by Aamir khan while questioning the religious guru's is childlike but still portrays the maturity and logical thinking which is very much needed today. The only thing which brought a change in the movie from Oh My God is the bomb blast in the name of religion and love angle between an Indian girl and Pakistani boy.

Why putted the same story which we have seen in many Bollywood, Hollywood movies? waited for so called best director of Bollywood Raju Hirani more than 5 years but what he gave us such a bad movie like PK? such a headache type of movie... what's our fault? what's out mistake... i had a lot of expectation from the movie but it totally disappointed me.... same story, same dialogues, same irritating message and mention the word \"PK\" over 100 times for full 2 and half HOURS !! was expecting something like Munna Bhai but PK seems more worst than Talaash \"Out of the whole world actually out of the whole UNIVERSE\"...don't ever forget HE is not from this planet.... well can't tell you the story as i am still feeling headache because of the movie but i have only only suggestion, don't waste your important time and money on such a silly movie, only Aamir Fans can bear it but i have doubt this time they might not bear it too... it's like all B-grade actors you could ever think of in bollywood.... PK (Besides laughing, singing, dancing etc and even crying the moment the PK does the same expression) !!Though this sounds similar to 'Oh My God!' Music is really boring, Borinh songs and all songs work as welcome break in the film... Editing is weak and cinematography is very very bad Director Rajkumar Hirani sorry to say this being your Fan but this time impact is no where close to his best work 'Lage Raho Munnabhai'. Film tries hard but then that should not be visible. Because it is releasing after 'Oh My God', the novelty goes away to some extent.. and lastly Anushaka Sharma..who is just looking extremely poor in PK, as Katrina had 5 minute roles in Dhoom 3 with Aamir she have the same less Screen Play in PK & most important thing she was looking extremely ugly, didn't match chemistry with Aamir or with Sushant Singh Rajput.. WHO ? WHY ? WHAT? A must watch for all those in COMA or suffering from various neurological..psychological conditions..This movie might just CURE your condition..",

And that tells a story in itself.First the positives: Solid performance from entire cast, good message, decent script and direction. Technically sound. Flip side: Lacks originality - basic concept mimics OMG (with lesser impact), it gets repetitive after a while on bashing (primarily) Hindu religious practices, the villain has strong similarities to evil God man from Singham 2, the climax (Indo-Pak aspect) was a let down and over simplified. Unnecessary nudity by Aamir and several references to sex were avoidable - this could have been one true family film. Too much time spent glorifying Aamir's acting abilities. The B&W sarcasm from 3-idiots also makes its way.After two very honest and straight-from-the-heart Munnabhai ventures, Hirani lost grounds in 3-idiots (even if it was his biggest commercial success). With PK, he get totally ordinary, playing to gallery and roping in every trick to make this a commercial success, which it surely is.",

Last time they took on Education System and this time they are taking on God and Godmen. It is an attempt to have a sarcastic take on religions and their practices. Story is being narrated by Anushka Sharma about her friend; PK. PK is an alien whose remote which enables him to return to his planet gets stolen. And the quest to find that remote is begun. He is 'alien' to these conditions, unaware of simplest concepts of clothes, fashion, food, money etc. from one perspective this may seem unique, but is very similar to old Hindi movies where protagonist from village comes to city and is flabbergasted by norms and methods of cities resulting in funny incidents. Same follows here as well. He meets Sanjay Dutt by accident, literally. After a regular song sequence he heads to Delhi to find the remote. After certain failures, someone tells him only GOD can save him. He is naturally surprised by this, the fact that GOD has answers to all questions, solution to all problems, remedies for all tragedies, astonishes them. He tries to find GOD. Will he succeed? That's the basic plot, during which spontaneous situations occur where contradictions between every religion provides the humor. What Works in The Movie:Amir Khan has done his best to portray a Bhojpuri speaking Alien. Performance of Saurabh Shukla is commendable; he has really come into his own since Jolly LLB and has started getting roles he deserve. Anushka Sharma is the usual girl, underused to say the least. What Goes Wrong in The Movie: 1. EDITING. Rajkumar Hirani is Ex Student of FTII, Pune where he completed course in Editing. Hence His editing has been brilliant in his previous movies, 3 idiots is one of the best edited movie. but in this one it is horribly wrong. First half seems entertaining but second half feels stretched. And the FINAL TWIST could be seen by a miles distance. Scene where he puts a stone outside a college and people start worshipping it, has no relation with the main story of the movie.2. Music: in one interview Hirani said when he watches his old movies, he always feels something can be improved. He pointed out that song in Munnabhai MBBS 'chan chan' was irritating. I am sure when Hirani watches PK again he would use scissors on at least two songs. 3.Shashtrarth: those who are not aware with this word, it is like a 'rap battle' between two intelligent people who would debate on any given issue and one gladiator of words will emerge victorious. In the end, there's build up to the scene where Amir Khan's Character argues with Saurabh Shukla. Of course cautions are used to avoid controversies, or hurt sentiments. But when they are discussing about Religion or GOD, shouldn't they have also consider some logical preachers so that point of view from both side can be understood. For example if we are having Bollywood vs Hollywood argument. Hollywood sends Steven Spielberg and we send KRK. So what should have been a constructive debate ends up being a monologue. We know that Hirani is trying to make this movie since 2010 but during this period, people have already seen 'OMG'. audience might feel a little 'd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu' due to many similarities between both. Aim of this movie should have been placing arguments from both sided but this one unfortunately passes predetermined judgments. For instance all religious believers are shown superstitious. There are rational people who believe in GOD and are religious might find this a bit biased. So in the end, the movie which was dubbed as most awaited movie of the year, ends up being a just above average movie. My Rating: 6/10",

Pk is light hearted and funny at the beginning, but becomes more and more intriguing and serious towards the end, while proving its point loud and clear at the end. Only someone like Rajkumar Hirani could convey such an important message effortlessly amidst a good story and a normal backdrop. Pk features good performances and great dialogue sprinkled throughout the film, which ensure that the movie stays with you long after the end. Verdict: pk has potential to be a modern classic, joining the past works of the director, like 3 idiots. Aamir Khan renews faith in good bollywood mainstream cinema with a daredevil effort to try a potentially scandalous story. Pk is a delight for both casual moviegoers and hardcore movie fans.",

            "content": "Although the film has few flaws in its story-telling, PK is more than watchable because of its great comic moments and for taking up a subject, Religion, which for a long time in its history, bollywood had decided to steer clear of. And there are good reasons for it. Movies which have religion as its subject matter always tend to be controversial. We are seeing the same thing with PK with many suits being filed which thankfully the courts have dismissed quickly.In a year where we have had a very short supply of quality movies, PK will come as a breath of fresh air. Just like his first three films, Rajkumar Hirani again takes up a socially relevant subject and laces it with humor and idiosyncratic situations. We would find many of Hirani's trademarks in this movie. The central character who is a misfit who gets mocked at the beginning before winning everyone's hearts one by one and ends up being the agent of change. The main antagonist is not an evil person but one who has misguided beliefs. The film is a combination of laughing-out loud moments and some tear-jerking moments.Whereas the comic moments are as laughable as was the case with Munnabhai and 3 Idiots, it is the emotional moments where it comes up short. And the major reason is that the movie doesn't devote enough time in fleshing out the relationships between the characters. Case in point, Anushka and Sushant's romance and break- up and also Anushka's relationship with his father. Also, except for Aamir and Anushka's characters, most of the supporting characters don't have much to do which is highly unfortunate for a cast with talents like Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla and Sanjay Dutt. Another flaw is that the first half involves too many songs which breaks the flow of the story and the second half tends to get preachy at times and the ending seemed to be a bit melodramatic just like 3 Idiots.Aamir Khan's PK is the heart and soul of this movie and he comes up with arguably one of his best performance of his career alongside his performances in Lagaan, Rang De Basanti, 3 Idiots etc. Expect him to win many best actor awards in this award season although he wouldn't be attending those award functions. Anushka Sharma plays a bubbly character and she is more than efficient in this role. Sanjay Dutt is wonderful in his brief screen role. Saurabh Shukla is watchable. Boman Irani is wasted in a role who has very little to do. The writing team of 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi, comes up with another socially relevant script and their work is top-notch although it isn't as water-tight as their previous work. The music by Shantanu Moitra is pretty good although the songs aren't as memorable as 3 Idiots. My picks are Bhagwan Kaha Hai Tu, Chaar Kadam and the PK theme.PK is not a movie which will please everyone. In fact, many will get offended due to its anti-religious views (A good example are the protests ranging in Gujarat accusing the movie of hurting Hindu sentiments). My advice to these people is not to misinterpret the message in the film. Just like the similar themed Paresh Rawal- starrer Oh My God, this movie is not telling us to stop having faith in God but it is questioning whether the medium by which we try to communicate with God is right or not. I recommend all of you to watch this movie at- least once. Whether you like it or not, you will not be able to erase this movie from your memory for a good time. And how many recent bollywood films linger in your memory even for a moment after you have finished watching it?",

            "review_title": "An eye-opening take on religion that every Indian needs to watch",
            "content": "After the Munnabhai movies and 3 Idiots, it is natural to have mammoth expectations from a Rajkumar Hirani. A movie that hits you hard, delivers a strong message and makes the public question some age old conventions and beliefs, that's what his past movies had (some of them in bits and pieces, others in spades). PK though, is the strongest of his efforts on that front.PK is about Aamir's character (named PK by the public) arriving from a distant planet on earth on a research mission only to have his \"remote control\" stolen. This remote, is the sole means by which he can summon the spaceship that brought him here to get him back. Without the remote, he is essentially stuck on earth. He slowly starts learning the nuances of earthly culture and language and gradually moves closer towards finding the remote. He also realizes from the public that it is God alone who can help him find it. In the process, he ends up questioning and challenging the religious belief system that India has built involving multiple religions, each with their own set of traditions.That last part is what hits you hard about PK. The fact that there is only one God, the true God, the one who created us all unlike the many Gods that exist and are worshiped on a daily basis is something worth taking home. Also, by this time, I wouldn't call PK being an alien a spoiler since this is very much clear from the start of the film itself (and in fact, is something that the screenwriter Abhijat Joshi has heavily hinted at in a Plot Summary written by him on IMDb).Aamir is spot on with his portrayal of PK and one almost feels that he's back in form after the disastrous (but still financially successful) Dhoom: 3. His performance is again going to be a talking point for months to come and perhaps, may even land him the Filmfare yet again. The others complement Aamir well enough especially Anushka, who, despite having considerably fewer films under her belt almost feels like a seasoned performer by now.But the laurels all go to Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi for the wonderful script and direction; the script has so much material it moves at a break necking speed, never quite running out of events or situations. The crisp editing allows them to pack in a lot of stuff without it taking way too much time. The romance could have been toned down a bit as it was the only part that felt a bit unnecessary but in the end, that is a minor quirk in an otherwise outstanding effort. Shooting in real locations in Delhi such as the Red Fort and even a metro station lends an authenticity to the film that sets can simply not achieve. The music is strictly functional though and unlike the \"Give Me Some Sunshine\" song in Hirani's 3 Idiots, such a hard hitting number is missing.For a country like India with an over-surge of religions, languages and traditions that sometimes border on meaninglessness, PK as a movie is an eye-opener. Sure it has its cheesy moments and it may not exactly be a \"complex\" piece of art in the league of Terrence Mallick or Christopher Nolan movies. But in an industry like Bollywood which is plagued with commercial no-brainers from one Khan after another, PK is not only a strong film, it is a laudable effort. I'd recommend every Indian to watch this film at least once and wake up from the nonsense that is being served in the name of religion to truly realizing what God is all about.Overall Score: 8.0 / 10",

And yet it never raises question over God and his existence. Even though it targets religion as many will feel I don't think it stops there.it asks question to the society. How no1 offers pk food when he is hungry but as soon as he wears a police dress every1 comes running forward to try and please him. How fear is instilled in our minds to exploit us and many more. U have to watch it to understand . I have cut a point only because the music is not so good though it blends with the story to an extent and reinforces the charm of the protagonist. It's an awesome movie by the best director I know by far. Do watch it but with an open mind and try and challenge some of your hypocrisies too.",

The promo's have been intriguing as producers have not revealed much about the movie but has claimed that the plot would be its USP. Loosely inspired by OMG! PK takes a dig at the religious dogma and superstitions prevalent in today's time. Its a satire which exposes religion based commercialization and differentiates God from the god-men. Also, Hirani take a similar protagonist like 3 idiots, who is an outsider, who challenges the tradition and tries to simplify the system. PK has a wonderful humor which highlights religious myths by way of simple but well thought of amusing acts. The second half of the movie is bit stretched where the plot creates a face-off between PK and a god-men. Perhaps, Hirani could have craftily used some political/ economic satire to the present plot to end the repetition. All said, PK stands out because of one person, Aamir Khan, who takes his stature to a new high with this performance by playing the part with extreme precision. Hirani is successful in achieving a melodramatic ending much like his previous works! PK is definitely not-to-be missed movie of this year.",

            "content": "No doubt, this film is much overrated and created much hype than that it deserves. The film shows the way we try to find god or interpret god is not right. The medium we use to reach god (babas, or any religious organizations) are mostly misleading. The way we think about reaching god is not right, actually that is a \"wrong number\" or a \"cross connection\". Very true.Anyway, i think this is the core of the film. But what is new in there? All these were addressed in Oh My God and was showcased in far far better way. PK raise questions in our heart - is it the right way we are trying to reach god? are those people who claims themselves as messenger of god are really genuine? it says we should start thinking and question ourselves before believing them blindly. Again what is new?Finally, PK proves the \"baba\" a wrong guy and also proves Sushant was not wrong in a highly dramatic way. Then PK returns home. Happy ending.At the end it remains a love story of Anushka and a put a question how we seek god. That is all about PK.May be it tried to demonstrate that only one truth is there and that is human and their love. But i feel PK lacks (or misses) that part. More ever it fetches a love story in exotic location (Belgium i believe), a terrorist attack which merely has to do anything with this film. Hence, i feel it misses its focus. If you watch Oh My God you know what the film is trying to speak. Surely Oh My God connects much much better.The reason i am comparing so much is i had a great expectation from Raju Hirani (after Munnabhai MBBS and 3 idiots). As he gives a new message and food for thought to its viewers. But this i found is a masala remake of Oh My God. Surely i would give it a huge rating if Oh My God was not released before this. Very much upset and frustrated this time. So, who has not watched Oh My God yet and think it is a masterpiece, please don't wait.Lastly, i would like to ask where in India will find so much of \"dancing cars\" :)",

P.k. guarantees the exactly similar experience , except instead of Inception, there is a pile of garbage and instead of Interstellar, there is a bunch of non- sense. A movie loses its respect in a very first scene where a spaceship is shown and a naked human like creature is dropped on earth. spaceship and Bollywood movies do not go hand in hand. Shirish Kundar and Rakesh Roshan know that. Rajkumar Hirani should have asked them first. Sloppy content, meaningless dialogs, jokes that make you cry, flow that makes you fall asleep, height of overacting and unnecessary attempt to damage people's brain are key characteristics of this movie. Story doesn't make sense. Logic goes completely orthogonal. Some would say, there is a social message in a movie about God and religion. My advice for such people would be \"Try to think once in a while, it helps growing your brain\". There are some unanswered questions like why does Sushant Singh Rajput not change his cloths? Why do people write a context less 'I am sorry' note which everyone can read and make sense out of it for their own purpose? Why was Sanjay Dutt even brought into the movie and killed in a very unnecessary Bomb Blast?I guess this is the beacon of death for Indian cinema invaded by commercial movies and soon the time will come when I would say \"Gone are the days..\"",

WHY IS IT GOOD?Rajkumar Hirani's intelligent and clever writing supported by Abhijit Joshi. - Unique Plot where an alien is introduced to a place where many religions survive. (What a curious plot) - Not only godmen are targeted but also the cultural differences are questioned. (After someone's death, white is the code among Hindus, black in Christians) which will confuse a person from other world. - Aamir Khan's preparation for his character can easily be seen. Top notch acting from Mr. Perfectionist. One of the best of his career. Just brilliant Aamir. - Cuteness of Anushka and Sushant. - Not a single boring minute in the film. The film progresses in a flow. - The issue the movie raises. Hindu fanatics are showing their true colors although the bad practices of every religions were targeted. WHY IS IT BAD?Huge expectations from Mr Hirani who gave us Munnabhai series and 3 Idiots. - Bad characterization of Boman Irani and Shukla. I don't find Shukla (My Fav) a fit in this role. Boman's talent is not utilized properly. - Out of sync songs which could not get mixed with the movie beautifully. Well, decent background score. - Love story between PK and Jaggu? Seriously? You are not a commercial director Hirani. - Oh My God came before Pk but is still remains in our Hearts. - The idea of a love story between a Pakistani and an Indian was great but it had serious flaws. It appeared out of syn many times. No clever writing here. - PK's debate with Tapasvi Maharaj? It could have been different in my opinion.Aamir is forgiven for Dhoom 3. Rajkumar Hirani's Munnabhai Mbbs remains his masterpiece. Queen remains the delight this year. Aamir ruling box office as always.",

            "content": "After a long string of flops this year, here comes a relief of a film, called,\"PK\". After directing the film, which delivered a well-aimed kick in the pants to our myopic, rote-learning education system, \"3 Idiots\", here comes another dish from the master chef (read:- another film from the master director), Rajkumar Hirani. After 5 years in the making, \"PK\" finally released in the theatres a week ago. Let's analyse how good the film would be!The film starts off with PK (Aamir Khan), an alien, landing on earth, in the desert of Rajasthan, to study about human begins and life on earth. Arriving stark naked on a earth, PK has a rough start on the planet when his tracking remote, that helps him send signals back to his spaceship, gets stolen. He now has to find the remote to contact his spaceship and till then survive on earth on his own. Unaware of human mannerisms, language or life in general on earth, PK finds it difficult to adjust. However, fate brings him in touch with Bhairav Singh (Sanjay Dutt) who becomes his dear friend and helps him with life on earth.But destiny takes PK to Delhi. From here on starts a whirlwind story of a stranger in the unknown city of Delhi asking questions that despite their innocence hold a valuable and deep meaning. Aided on by Jagat Janani (Anushka Sharma) who teams up with him on this journey, PK challenges some of the oldest rituals of religion that are ruling life of people on earth.First of all, though tackled in Umesh Shukla's film,\"OMG - Oh My God\", the issue still is quite prevalent and debatable, and that is the issue of our 'blind-faith' on God. Skilfully adding humour to the narrative, this issue is tackled by 'an outsider'. The one, who does not belong to our planet. Raju Hirani scores brownie points on this one. But, the only complaint against the movie is that the romantic angle (Sushant Singh Rajput and Anushka Sharma) is not well-developed. Moreover, some scenes were ended abruptly. But these blemishes are not so significant to affect the narrative.The story-screenplay (Rajkumar Hirani, Abhijat Joshi) is skilfully written and structured, though at places flawed. Dialogues (Sreerag Nambiar) are mostly Bhojpuri-laden, mostly spoken by the titular character (played by Aamir Khan). It might become a bit undecipherable, for those who are not familiar with this language. But otherwise, they are witty.Of the cast, Aamir Khan has really got some 'balls' for going nude for a scene. Aamir never ever disappoints, in terms of performance. This time too he didn't disappoint. He sinks his teeth into the character quite well, and asks such innocent questions, regarding the religion we obsess for, which might sound, or look, stingy. Saurabh Shukla, as the smarmy Godman excels. Anushka Sharma as Jaggu, the news reporter with a Bob-hairdo, acts well. Sushant is just sidelined. Rest of the cast do well.On the whole, \"PK\" might offend those, who will take the issue, tackled in the movie, seriously. Otherwise, it is one of the best films of 2014. Sorry for reviewing this movie, 8 days after its release. But I'll be back, and review for the espionage-action movie, \"Baby\", starring Akshay Kumar, Taapsee Pannu, Anupam Kher, Rana Daggubati and Danny Denzongpa, among others. See you all on that day, till then belated merry Christmas and in advance a very Happy New Year.",

            "content": "To me it seems Mr. Hirani has 4 subjects that he absolutely loves to talk about. 1) Education System. 2) Mr. Gandhi and his principles. 3) Religion. 4) Being different (aka Purple Cow).Take any movie of his, these issues come up in various ratios. Every character has to be very different, aka Purple Cow. While 3 Idiots and Munnabhai MBBS focused on the educational system, there were subtle hints of religion being questioned in each and every movie. He took that subtle part and bifurcated in that direction. End result? PK.In order to look at the way we do things, a character had to be like a child, or completely unaware of what goes on in India. Someone from another country? Nah! That person might have a religion associated with him/her. Conflict of interest. Chuck it. Then who could it be?People from outer space are unknown. We have no idea who they are and they have no clue of who we are. Idea! The protagonist could be from outer space! He knows nothing, it's perfect. And anything he does or anything he questions has no conflict of interest. Sounds good? Yes it does. And so the movie shooting begins. AK is PK. RK is no idea who. But AK is PK. It is obvious from the first scene that astronauts on their planet take their fitness regime very seriously, as already stated above. And they have no issues flaunting their physiques and in fact roam around like you would at Anjuna Beach in Goa. There's also a very unhealthy drink sold in the United States by that name. Yes, Naked. :DThink about PK. He lands in Bhojpur, India. Thankfully he did not land in Russia during December in that condition. He looks around to see people wearing different clothes and thinks it's their skin. The concept of clothes is new to him. And so his journey begins. His first introduction is with a thief. The thief steals the only thing PK is wearing. His remote. The remote that establishes communication with his spaceship. His whole logic of landing on Earth was to do \"research\". But right now, all PK is focusing on is \"search\". Search for his remote. When he searches for it again, they call it research. Poor guy couldn't focus on what he came for, instead gets trapped in a completely tangent loop. He is introduced to the diverse culture in India, only to realize that the diversity is not an issue, the non-acceptance of others way of practicing faith is an issue. Faith is not questioned, religion is.The moments are captivating, and the song \"Bhagwaan\" will choke you. If it doesn't I recommend a psychiatrist to take care of your deep rooted psychological and emotional issues to make sure you haven't landed from any outer space and you are, in fact, human. Aamir's expressions are amazing. He did NOT BLINK once during the entire movie. If he did and I missed it, I'd be happy to know when. The \"Sarat Manjoor Hai\" will remind you of Lagaan.RK's cameo at the end could suggest a sequel being thought of. Perhaps the alien might want to check out a few different countries, and gets introduced the word F1 visa. Perhaps, he comes to the US and is NOT surprised when they call him a Non Resident Alien. \"Are you an Alien sir? Yes, but how do you know.\" Perhaps he is now introduced to the consulting system and the Immigration system here. Perhaps that's a story every desi could correlate with. Perhaps we are also looking for the right time for our remotes so we can go home. I went all tangent, but idea to acha hai.Simplicity is Mr. Hirani's weapon of choice. He can explain the most complicated things with very simple lines. No lamba lamba philosophical lectures. Yes, philosophy can be explained in a fun way. And it's done nicely here.Is this an awesome film? It depends on your choice and your philosophies. Personally, I loved 3 Idiots better, maybe because of the whole Engineering and college type jokes. The way our country is at the moment, there are huge set of issues to deal with. If not religion, people would divide themselves with something else. Say, a football team? A University they graduated from? Alumni? Sections? CrossFit? P90X? LOL. Honestly, it is human nature to belong to a sect, a tribe, a group. It gives us security to be belonged. We can't take away that fact. That's OK as long they don't look down upon other groups and they maintain unity amongst each other. The issue talked about in the movie goes beyond the segregation. It's about divide. Practice what you want, how you want, but do not divide. What we can do however, is respect every other group and know that no matter what, it all means the same thing. Peace, Progress, Unity.The story does evoke various emotions and there will be comparisons with \"Oh My God\" that came out earlier. Slight resemblance due to the nature of the subject, but the treatment is different. Due to the nature of the shaking car and the band baaja baraat dialogue scenes, I recommend you watch this movie without your kids. I wish India had a rating system for age groups and theaters actually enforced it. Now that would be a nice subject Mr. Hirani. Something out of your comfort zone too.Thanks for reading, see you in the future.",

His confusion in spite of being an astronaut from supposedly a more advanced civilization doesn't make sense. The first half mostly deals with PK discovering earth way of living or i must say Indian way of living...The movie is hardly a one time watch.",

PK: A Benchmark, A Showstopper, A Headliner. Words cannot describe this movie. If someone should have a right to write something, in my opinion, that would be RKH. His splendid and charismatic movies are always fun prolific but they do convey a mind-boggling message to the civilization.Coming back to this movie, Aamir's performance is a delight to watch, as usual. The cuteness he carries along with him, in this movie, will make you think that indeed, Bollywood has not lost his charm on domestic and international level. Actually, his tendency of acting reminds me of Tom Hanks (An actor with versatile varieties). PK will not leave you for a minute, Aamir's \"eye popping out\" act will not let you blink, even for a second. A movie blessed with Emotions, Drama, Comedy, Anushka/Boman/Sushant/Saurabh's protean acting is nothing but perfection under Mr Perfectionist. I hope, Raju and Aamir continue these stupendous adventures together, forever, so that there is a reason to buy a worthy ticket for a worthy movie. This movie is for all and mark my words, you won't get disappointed.And a suggestion for the novices, want to learn acting, please join Aamir Khan's school of perfection.\"Re Bhaaya! Tharki Chokro Aayo re Banke maaro Mehmaan\"",

            "content": "Fail to understand why this movie has got such amazing ratings and rave reviews. The movie is a one time watch. Compared to the other movies coming out in Bollywood, yes this is better but definitely not the best of 2014 nor is it Hirani's best baby. P.K. has a message which has more and less been delivered in the past by OMG: Oh my God! and the latter did it more effectively hands down. Drawing comparisons with OMG is obvious as both share a common subject. While the execution was way better in OMG, the star power is clearly helping P.K. rake in more moolah. The cheap marketing tactics of Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Aamir Khan ( increasing the charges from every theater screening it just a day before the release) have only helped in making it one of the top 10 grossers ever in the history of Bollywood.Coming back to the review, pluses first, 1. Star cast 2. Performances 3. Subject 4. HumourThe movie has its moments, specially as far as the humour quotient is concerned. A few scenes are genuinely very funny while others at least make you smile. The emotional scenes are decent but fail to leave an impression (not the kind you would discuss once you are out of the theater). The message is good nevertheless and makes you feel that more such cinema is required. Coming to the cons, direction is average and like mentioned earlier is flawed by the snail pace at which the movie rolls. Many scenes seem stretched. What did the editor do? The songs were never needed in this movie and the fact that none is good only adds to your woes.The sluggish pace of the movie hits a new high towards the climax which is dumb and hilarious.Performances wise, of course Aamir Khan is great as usual. I personally loved Sanjay Dutt in a brief but important role. It was good to see him on screen and putting in an honest effort. Anushka Sharma, except for her lip-job-gone-horribly-wrong upper lip, does very well and looks pretty. Saurabh Shukla is impressive as the god man. Boman Irani and Balraaj Sahni are frankly wasted and don't get anything significant.Overall it makes for a decent one time watch first for the subject and then for the performances put in by the actors. While I am still bedazzled by the over the top positive review, I only hope the audience is not just enjoying the humour and walking back home. It would make much more sense if they learn a thing or two and apply it to their lives. Yes, then this movie would deserve at least a 9 if not a perfect 10. Go watch it with less expectations, you might just like it more.",

Wonder why there is a dearth of invention...and so much repackaging.The so called 'comedy with message' which neither makes people laugh nor completes the argument to a level an intelligent Indian audience is capable of debating. The actor should realize that his 50 year old 'uncool' demeanor has dramatic limitations and pushing it will only end up with making a fool out of himself. This movie joins the league of senseless projects that are shown to be successful because of their 'projected' box office numbers. The major revenue from Indians abroad is simply because they just like a couple hours of desi talk and song for a change, which they go in believing it will be senseless anyways. Indian audiences' strong buying power and lack of available alternatives make their sole trip to the cineplex ring the cash counter. Any silly act cannot be called entertainment. I do not remember any recent movie that has stayed on people's mind for more than a week. Why do we make such trace less movies?",

PK asks some sensitive questions. It's innocent. The movie didn't try to give away the answers. It's up to you if you wanna find the answers. And the film never made fun of any religion. It just made fun of the businesses that take advantage of people's weakness towards religion. The questions PK asks are not genius. Religious speakers pitch these questions at each other every day.I'll never understand the appeal of \"Hindi film songs\". They give me headaches. I mean you are moving up in the film industry. You are adding sex scenes. But you can't get rid of these unnecessary musicals!And another thing that has been bothering me, how come everyone's so pale? I mean it's India. Where are the Brown people. the majority, People who looks like me!Final verdict: 6.4/10. A poor film. But an entertaining comedy. I hardly say \"It's funny\" about comedies these days.

The story\\concept explored in this movie is not new to the Indian audience, but when it is told by one of best director and best actor of India it gives altogether A WHOLE NEW OUTLOOK towards the message the movie is conveying.

While devotion to one god or religion is a very personal matter and when there is a fear or lack of hope misdirected and unwanted middleman may crop up - the whole devotion to god and acts to reach the god may be disputed.

The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed.

There were way too many inconsistencies and i felt like I am watching the mixture Lage raho Munnabhai and OMG. The movie was full of illogical and mother of coincidences sequences.. They tried to make it funny but man i got bored. Thankfully Aamir downloaded Bhojpuri bcoz language itself sounds funny and there was nothing funny which character added to the movie. I liked the fact that Boman Irani for once played a positive character in RKH films and Mr. Parikshit Sahni had his trademark typical dad role which hadn't changed from Munnabhai to PK.

I am Hindu and aware of loop-holes in age old traditions, some had a meaning but some really does not.First of all I wanted to stay away with movie with some friends calling it is just to malign Hindu religion, so I stayed away for 3 weeks but then thought to give a shot as I heard it's on line of Oh My God !!Movie started well, an alien look for Amir, and he was nude and that was for quite literally long time, I think such scenes are rare in Indian cinema with numero uno actor in it :) but he did it fabulously. Just when excitement was about to begin he loses his remote and from that point we come to know what's the story is all about as trailers did good job :) so from there it was on predictable line. Munnabhai, Sushant have guest roles and they did pretty well. Anushka (duck lady) was major disappointment in the movie. This role did not demand any new thing for her, and she also did not get any scenes to shine same goes with Boman - how he was used in both Munna bhai also in 3 Idiots but here he is there for thankless role. And there are many many faces from Rajkumar Hirani's previous films who come and go. Music is also big letdown for this movie, none of the songs really have anything to carry. Every now and then movie gave me feeling that Paresh Raval is better actor and Oh My God ! was a better movie than this one. Paresh Raval being a human but non-believer on god looked more real in his argument, acting and really nailed the traditions. Here Hirani plays safe, he tried to nail the issue but again does not do with full of heart - something stopped movie from going all in and proving the point. Oh My God had loop-holes but the arguments which was made in movie in brilliant scenes in courtroom really stood out. But here the confrontation between Swamy and PK was just for 15 minutes and Swamy lost the argument just based on one prediction. More solid point should have come at that time to look it more convincing, but again Hirani wanted to unite Sarfaraz and Duck lady so he did it. And yes what I really did not like is why Sarfaraz was made Pakistani, I mean I am okay that Pakistan's people are honest and may be good at heart but the same conclusion was okay even if Sarfaraz was an Indian but from Muslim family - no ? But again logics were gone for a toss the moment the remote was stolen so suddenly. I am going with 5/10 stars, and I take that blame because I watched Oh My God !! at least 10-15 times and every time I see I feel fresh, and I really doubt if I am going to watch PK on television (may be for my kid I may have to do)Earning 300 crore does not mean movie is good :) it's weaker movie in all sense. Expected much better from Hirani after his three superior movies he made in past. Hopefully he comes up with better engaging storyline next time. And for Aamir - I am awaiting for a quality movies like TZP, Sarfarosh, RDB and of course 3 Idiots.",

            "content": "After 5 years, we finally have \u202a#\u200eRKH\u202c's masterpiece on silver screen through PK, which is one step ahead of his previous directional another masterpiece \"\u202a#\u200e3idiots\u202c\". It need to be mentioned here that the direction has taken film making to another level altogether. PK has depth, which formulates a message that can also be debatable..........Story line is fascinating, it has surprise which unfold layer by layer remarkably. Narration in the movie is water-tight, more gripping and entertaining. Screenplay of the film is comprehensive and engrossing with humorous situations and lively dialogues. Kudos to RKH for his effort towards the film, his honesty, simple story writing.............Music, lyrics, lead voice are pitch perfect according to situations, it connects the story as well. The background score is fixed jelled with frames. Best in the lot \"\u202a#\u200eChar_Kadaam\u202c\".......\u202a#\u200eAamir\u202c Khan excels in the role. This is one of the challenging role that he had played so far and with stellar performance, carries the film all the way. His role in PK is beyond imagination, so his performance has to be experienced. Aamir childlike innocence, the Bhojpuri accent adds layers to the character, more than his words it's his expressions, which add volume. PK is the biggest achievement of Aamir Khan's career and his best performance ever. He once again proved why he's ahead of his contemporaries as a visionary and a thinker.....\u202a#\u200eAnushka\u202c Sharma stand shoulder to shoulder with Aamir through the entire film. Jaggu is typical Delhi girl, smart, witty and a go-getter. Yes of course I fell in love deeply with her cute, refreshing look as well as her acting. Once again she proved that she need not to do many films in a year. \u202a#\u200eSushant\u202c is impressive in an extended cameo. \u202a#\u200eSaurabh\u202c Sukla, \u202a#\u200eBoman\u202c role also give a meatier part in the film, thoroughly enjoyed their performance as well. \u202a#\u200eSanjay\u202c Datt manages his role as Rajasthani man with panache and PK's first friend in this Planet called \"Earth\"......If \"3idiots\" was about \"all izz well\", PK is about \"battery KO charge Karo\" & \"Wrong Number\"......PK will make you laugh, will make you warm, will make you cry, most importantly it will change our society's vision with its message. Once again I will give thanks to RKH for his innovative way of express the message.....I am not revealing, but there is a big surprise for all at the end with a cameo role....Guys you cannot afford to miss this!!! \u202a#\u200eRaj_Kumar_Hirani\u202c--- Exceptional Direction. \u202a#\u200eAamir_Khan\u202c --- Perfection, Flawlessness, Impeccability, Bewitchment, Stupendousness, if all these nouns and many more be choked together and are heated to personification, the world gets a unique living heavenly being --- \"Aamir Khan\", Immaculate sense of script, magnificently delivers a tough act in a flick. \u202a#\u200eAnushka_Sharma\u202c --- Terrific, without her this movie cannot be made. \u202a#\u200ePK\u202c --- Emotions, Drama, Comedy, Message, Outstanding, Monster Hit, for me it suppress 3idiots.",

            "content": "PK is one of the better movies in the recent times. Could have been better without some songs. Though its similar to Oh My God, Raju Hirani adds his own flavor and style.Plot: It all starts of with Aamir being an alien and is on a research mission with his spaceship landing at Rajasthan. His remote gets stolen and he is not at all acquainted with human beings and their behavior. Slowly he learns Bhojpuri and asks everyone about his remote. They advice him to ask GOD and thus starts the journey of PK and his search for GOD and then all other things unfold which would be better watching on-screen then simply reading a review. Artiste's Performance: Aamir's performance is top-notch. Anushka Sharma looks a bit artificial but plays her part convincingly. Saurabh Shukla is very good as the Tapasvi Maharaj. Sushant Singh Rajput is superb. Boman Irani & Sanjay Dutt are awesome in their respective roles.Director: Raju Hirani again proves why he is the best director in India. Though its not his best it is still a great film. The aura he creates, the way he portrays each and every character is outstanding. Kudos to Rajkumar Hirani for making such a simple and sensible film.Conclusion: Its totally rib tickling in the first half, emotional in the second half but that's OK. I guess there will be a sequel to this with both Ranbir Kapoor and Aamir Khan. I think those who want this film to be banned simply cannot understand witty humor. Overall a must watch.! In 2012 it was OMG, In 2014 its PK. India needs movies like these now and then..",

I felt Raju Hirani completed script little too soon. You will love Aamir for his hard work for this character. Anushka has also done good job with her character \"Jaggu\".

Dialogues are amazing. It is now proved that rajkumar hirani is bollywood's best director ever. Story is unique.Acting: best performance of aamir ever. No one other than Aamir could have done this role. His expression were just amazing. Anushka was brilliant. Best acting of her career and this movie will surely boost her career. Sushant Singh, Sanjay Dutt, Boman and Shukla did justice to their short roles. Music: If you see just as a album it is average but when we watch it in this movie you definitely say amazing. All songs are choreographed amazingly. Especially the battery recharge dance. Director: Every scene was perfectly directed. It was not as good as 3 idiots because first of all 3 idiots was for youth and students life was portrayed so being a student i liked it more. If i rank hirani's movies it will be: 1. 3 idiots 2.

And that's a very high accolade indeed. It is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. Proud of Bollywood for having given birth to something so witty, intellectually pleasing, thought provoking and slickly made. Anushka Sharma delivered yet another sparkling performance. She's a true delight to watch, as is Aamir.The movie did have a few chewy parts. I suspect those were left in to adapt the movie to the taste of the larger Indian audience as an insurance against box office failure, so I wouldn't hold that against the director. I can now better understand a friend's sentiments when he expressed the urge to \"like\" his own positive comments on FB about the film. A creation so good does evoke that kind of joy.Coincidentally I just started reading \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. Though I've read only the first few pages so far, I believe that bits of the movie were inspired by this book. The story is similar to that of OMG: Oh My God! but outclasses that one by light years.This movie deserves a 12 star rating on a 10 star scale.",

Aamir has given one of his careers best performance. Director was so good in handling such a good storyline and at the same time the humor with a best message. Emotions and screenplay have been taken very well care of so that the every human can give it a thought of leading a simple meaningful life rather than complicating it by fooling around themselves getting into the hands of non purposeful people and statutes of no meaning at all. \"BEING GOOD AND DOING GOOD IS GOD,AND NOT PUNISHING AND LETTING OURSELVES TO DO NOTHING EXCEPT EXPECTING THE GOD TO DO EVERYTHING\". this is such a nice movie helping to be thoughtful and purposeful.

He came to know about the different religions and diversities in India....and how their cultures and traditions are different on a same phase and same point. Then he finally met reporter Juggu aka Jagat Janani aka Anushka Sharma who help him find his remote in the end of the movie. Rest is a mystery though I have told you enough... In one word \u202a#\u200eAamir\u202c acting has gone way beyond and you will sometime imagine that this is a second part of 3idiots as far as acting is concerned....so far his best according to me (other old actors and even young ones needs to learn this thing from him) Other actors are better but they don't have much script as Aamir movies used to have. Still Saurabh Shukla is very good in his role.. The movie though is a mixture of 3idiots and OMG in terms of comic timing and origin of God respectively. Though the movie is too good but still its not something you will watch 5-10 times.... In the second half the topic has been stretched like a rubber for quite sometime but it will not irritate you just because the acting is superb. And as like other Rajkumar Hirani movies this movie also contain a word \"Wrong-number\" like \"All is well\" in 3idiots and \"Jaadu ki jhappi\" in Munna bhai MBBS. The script of the movie takes all the credit and which is supported by some different level acting from Aamir Khan. A must watch if you believe in God and favour the fact that he is used as a marketing strategy in most places........rest will dislike and take this as an insult of their religions.....trust me it isn't A 9/10 from me.....Must watch for Aamir",

I must say when I watched the movie for the first time, I was so much disappointed with the movie overall, almost to the degree of hate and disgust primarily because of the critical subject matter that the makers touched on. I was displeased because I thought the maker Rajkumar Hirani is taking a propaganda of religion for his movie which should not have been made in the first place. It's only after the multiple viewing that I realized that the movie was not targeting the god and religion but the malpractice related with them. Overall, it's a glamorous, funny, moving and glorified Hirani movie with his humor and entertainment package.What did not work:\nplotholes and flaws; the movie is not without any flaws and loopholes. Some common questions were- how didn't PK know about condom when in fact he transferred the language from a women in the very occupation she has mastered. Instead, the makers could have edited the writing with maybe she stopped letting him hold her hand or something as a result he was partially informed.runtime and glorified scenes; I am sure songs could have been taken out or cut down for editing the runtime. I think the scenes with PK's love interest is not needed for the movie. Many scenes in the movie are glorified for entertainment purposes which could have been avoided. Also, at the end of the day I would not want to see a movie dealing with religious sentiments although the intent is not made regarding the religion. We cannot unsee scenes which were mean for comic purposes but have hurt the sentiments, at least for me. Even though not meant to harm, they somehow challenge us.Final verdict: only watch if you can take religious standup comedies, and of course if you can take the movie topic lightly. The overall message of the movie is rational but the narrative is not always pleasant.",

I've been a fan of Aamir Khan since 3 Idiots and have been worshiped his act, which actually much more better in PK. He could depict a perfect weirdo with a miraculously innocent gestures and full-of- questions eyes I obviously don't have any complain against this movie.

Khan acts the perfect picture of a goofy alien, and PK's questions and thought process were genuinely funny. The movie concept of someone placed in a new culture they don't understand isn't a new one, but PK certainly adds its own unique spin.However, the second half changes tune and becomes part drama and part philosophical think piece.

            "content": "The first half is entertaining, filled with laughter, not slapstick, but genuine comedy arose from awkward situations (not actions). As the story moves forward it becomes messy; it starts as the story of Pk and the concept of religion and god through his eyes, this part is brilliantly written, then, at one point, it becomes confusing if it's about his life, commentary on god or jaggu's personal life, etc. There are two love stories, one is important to the story, other plays a spoilsport.Some of the arguments by Pk are taken from Oh My God (2012). Like when Pk files F. I. R against god, and his analogy that a father (god alike) will never his son to the Himalayas to fulfill his demands, the scene where he makes a temple out of a stone and people calling out fake Sadhu's after his interview, but with an additional phrase- \"wrong number\". In a way, it doesn't have its own arguments in the theory of god.One thing it brilliantly does is highlighting some of the holes in modern theories of religion, some facts that everybody knows but keeps ignoring.End of the review.Unpopular opinion: Aamir Khan played an alien here. We don't know how aliens behave. In the first half, he didn't show human-like expressions and kept a 'confused' look throughout. In the second half, the story gets dramatic, and he displays emotions like humans. Although he received praise for his performance, he was weak, especially in last few scenes. But that's mainly because of the way the character was written. I sincerely believe his performance in the film is overrated.",

The movie is from the same Director-Actor (Rajkumar Hirani-Aamir Khan) duo which gave us the lovable '3 Idiots'; though this film lacks the depth and emotional impact of '3 Idiots', it asks far more serious questions about various beliefs and the discrimination resulting from it.The acting by everyone involved is commendable, especially Aamir who is the heart and soul of the film. It does have the regular Hirani ingredients: social commentary, Boman Irani, colourful cinematography and hummable music, and like his prior films, these things work in his favour.The characters could have been developed a little better, and a little more plot to the story could have done wonders for the film. But overall, it's quite an ambitious and courageous film in a country that takes religion far too seriously. The idea of making an alien the central character was a masterstroke; the way he looks at things with child-like curiosity and amazement is quite amusing and contemplative: same kind of people divided by the presence of various Gods and their own separate rules, the way people blindly follow anyone who claims to have a connection with God and throw logic to the side, the stereotypes we associate with various communities, the amount we give to religious institutions rather than charities or the needy, etc. It also has a small but interesting element of love; \"If you love someone truly, set them free.\" As a film, it may not appear so great, but as a social satire, it is something the country was in dire need of. Hope more people watch it and get a clearer view of the world.",

Do we have all our saints bad? Worst is Hindu will go gaga over this!! - Why our directors are so scared to show Hindu guy and Pakistani girl romancing instead of always showing Hindu girls with Muslims? Bollywood is continuously projecting Hindu girls as whores of Muslim guys!I loved 3 idiots, but this movie allegedly asks viewers to ignore all our culture and religion!! India is known because of it's culture and diversity, but this movie want people to modernize and left behind our cultures, religions, values and trust in God! Another OMG!!

            "content": "PK was my 35th movie in theatre this year I am happy I watched this movie as a closing credit to my \"movies watched in theatre list of 2014\". So here's my take on the movie.PK comes out with a bold and controversial plot on Religious beliefs or to say belief in Religion itself. India being a religiously sensitive place I should say hats off for Rajkumar Hirani for his brave attempt. Questioning the Education system of India in \"3 Idiots\" Hirani takes Religious followings and God men in his hands this time. Like the story is pretty simple what will be the answer to the question of a naive child born in a versatile religious environment about religion and God. The child who is going to ask all the questions on religion will be the Alien from a different galaxy played Amir Khan. I could easily say this was AK's one of the best performances till date. With his outlook as an alien with popping out eyes which hardly blinks, elongated ears and arched eyebrows he looks really a weird human being who arrives to world without clothes. AK has emoted well as an alien. His journey in finding his lost remote to get back to his world becomes the story and whom he met how the world treats him becomes the screen play. In this journey he learns and questions human beliefs in religion. He is been named PK by the people.On his way to help him we have been introduced to Jaggu the journalist with a broken heart played by Anushka Sharma. Her acting potential showed up towards the end of the movie particularly during the interview confront with her lost love Sarfaraz played by Sushant Singh Rajput. Sanjay Dutt plays as a band master and a friend to PK is an extended cameo and his character stays in our hearts. In between could not avoid thinking about the clich\u00e9s of the movie Oh My God !! BGM was OK. Movie had no great songs at all. Over the entire movie gave a hard message \"Believe in God who created us and not in the God created by us (ie religion!!)\" Watch it in theatre for fun filled jolly ride without becoming oversensitive to the criticism on rituals shown in the movie. I would rate 8 on 10. -Reviewed by Balachandran Sivakumar",

This was Aamir Khan's best ever performance and all the other actors did a great job too.People who are religious or superstitious or who don't think much are going to enjoy the movie because the questions raised by PK in the movie would seem witty and eye-opener to them, but it would be boring for those who observe, think and those who are atheists.",

            "content": "After the stupendous success of 3 Idiots which highlighted the maladies of an education system built on rote en route to setting new benchmarks of box-office success, in PK, the team of Rajkumar Hirani & Aamir Khan, put the multi-billion dollar industry called religion in their cross hairs.PK is an alien from a distant galaxy who lands in the middle of the desert in Rajasthan in a spaceship to study earth and its inhabitants. However, soon after landing on earth in the buff, he is divested of his remote - an exotic looking medallion - through which he can communicate to his spaceship to return to his planet. The stolen remote is purchased by Delhi based godman, Tapasvi Baba (Saurabh Shukla) who intends to use it to milk more money from his devotees for a grand temple project.PK follows the remote to Delhi and, on his way, is assisted by Bhairo Singh (Sanjay Dutt), a band leader in Rajasthan and Jaggu aka Jagatjanani (Anushka Sharma), a Delhi based TV journalist. There is a minor subplot involving a truncated romance between Jaggu and Sarfaraz (Sushant Singh Rajput), a Pakistani student, when they meet in Belgium.Using the curious eyes of a being from another world, ignorant of the ways of our world, the director raises several valid questions on religions - man-made paths to God - as well as to godmen - those self anointed custodians of the faith who enrich themselves in the name of salvation and instant solutions by preying on the fears and weaknesses of their devotees. Though most of these questions are neither new nor, by any measure, daring and have already been part of the recent Paresh Rawal movie, Oh My God, Hirani and Aamir approach the subject with sincerity and Hirani's trademark zest which is appealing to the viewers and makes an instant connect.\nAamir, despite his continuing penchant to over-act, is excellent as the bumbling alien who tries to make sense of the multiple contradictions - hypocrisies which are accepted norms of our everyday life - that confound him. Anushka Sharma has an effervescent presence and lights up the screen in every scene she appears. Rajkumar Hirani regulars Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahani, Saurabh Shukla along with Sushant Singh Rajput are effective in their minor cameos.PK has its fair share of flaws in the form of a rushed up romance in the first act that is dovetailed into a contrived climax of the third act which stick out as out of place appendages. The length of the movie could also have been clipped by 20 minutes at least to make it more crisper. While Hirani might have wanted to depict PK as a commoner, he could have still avoided the thick Bhojpuri accent for PK which is tacky and hampers clear understanding of his lines. The movie is in its elements in the middle portion when PK is on his exploratory quest throwing up common sense questions on the absurdities that confront him. Yet, The songs, while not chart busters, gel well with the narrative. While there is no doubt that Hirani's movies deal with issues which are socially relevant and his tone of communication despite being evocative, remains benign, one gets the feeling that, in PK, Hirani seems satisfied having barely scratched the surface of an important issue and that, in a sense, could account for a less than fulfilled sense when you leave the movie.Overall, PK is a brave attempt (perhaps, not brave enough) - and a cinematic SUCCESS as it packages an important message by flagging several hypocrisies and inanities that baffle us in the garb of religion, rituals, accepted norms and conventions into an entertaining movie with a healthy dose of fun.",

It would have been good if the definition of rationality were established in the movie. Atleast the maker's perception would have been known. If the maker wants audience to watch it without seriousness then the movie is OK. But there are serious audiences who are offended by its irreligious remarks. Also it has some irrational moments throughout. Only the negative aspects of religion is highlighted leaving aside others. But if we observe then everything starting from education, social services, politics, Art is nothing but Business. But PK emphasized only upon religion ? What about spiritualism hidden within the religious ? And so on...The UFO concept was average one but shown like a comedy rather than serious. The acting by Amir is not likeable esp as an extraterrestrial. The director tried to elevate the Bhojpuris upto advanced scientific status but it doesn't work that way. It needed step by step developement. Materialistic people are it's best viewers who negate the religious beliefs and traditions. Religion is a sensitive topic and needs the depth of perception in showing it. Watch The Da Vinci Code for reference. But PK doesn't do that, portraying only at the surface level.

Story teller has to be respectful to its characters so that each can make an impact on the 'Celluloid Collage'. RKH's movies always have a strong central antagonist character around which the story revolves. This movie lacks such a character. There is so much time given to build Aamir and Anushka's characters that the other characters fail to relate with the audience. The chemistry between Anushka-Sushant is under developed so when it is used in the second half, it doesn't generate the 'Awww moment' RKH expects. Love angle between PK and Anushka appears to be totally unnecessary and a 'Bhaste aaf time'. Comparisons are bound to happen between OMG and PK as PK's script borrows ideas from OMG. Where OMG was a 'Thought Provoking' movie, PK tries to 'Entertain' the audience rather than raising the important issues. For me OMG is still a refreshingly original film that stayed on the subject rather than exploring commercial dimensions like PK does. A below average climax, unimpressive music and under developed characters makes it an ordinary commercial film. At best, the movie is a one-time watch and not RKH's best work.",

Hirandani takes on a serious subject of religion and tries to turn it upside down through the eyes of PK an alien. It seems very inspired of the Hindi film 'Oh My God' which I felt was brilliant. PK does have its moments especially in the 1st half and beginning of the 2nd half, but towards the end, the movie drags and the comedy disappears. Unlike all his earlier works, the climax her is a disappointment because comedy dries up and the message is lost in translation. Also, an unnecessary Indo Pak angle is pushed into which doesn't hold. Suddenly from PK's story, it becomes the story of two other characters. PK is not a bad film. Its actually a good film and like OMG asks some important questions about are belief in God and religion.Aamir Khan is superb as PK and again proves that he is one of India's finest actor. It was a huge relief to see him laugh and make us laugh considering the fact that his previous outing Dhoom 3 where he was always moaning.Anushka is OK and holds herself against Aamir. The rest of the cast doing a commendable job starting from Rajput to Shukla and Irani.As I said earlier, its a decent watch though I feel that 3 Idiots was the best.",

His brand of cinema,ripe with humanism and compassion, always catches the pulse of the audience evoking the right degree of sentiments.If Lage Raho Munna bhai introduced us to Gandhigiri, 3 Idiots challenged the conventional educational system.His latest offering, PK is no different. Here,Hirani launches a crusade against our age-old religious practices, dogmas that have engulfed the humanity and superstitions inflicted upon us by the God-men through the eyes of an outsider who doesn't hail from this planet.Aamir plays an alien whose transmitter-like device gets stolen on his arrival to earth.Unable to contact his own fraternity, the mute oddball learns bhojpuri, chews countless paans, and wears outlandish clothes, thanks to the dancing cars and a series of hilarious (mis)adventures.In the process of his desperate search for the device, when he is told that only God can help him to find that,he sets to find God with all sincerity and discovers the prejudices and religious stigmas that have eclipsed our society.He also gets to be- friend the sprightly Jaggu(Anushka Sharma), a TV news reporter who initially dismisses his dispositions but later helps him after learning his full story.A bold and courageous endeavor by Raju Hirani which resonates with the rebellious overtones of his earlier ventures ,PK questions our religious strictures but with overtly humorous strokes.Hirani and co-writer Abhijat Joshi craft intelligent episodes with a cynical eye,without being preachy or judgmental about any particular religion or its associated customary practices.It comes in as a triumph for the writers who cultivate the irony in each of our routine nuances in the lightest vein.Through a breezy first half with ample doses of laughter, the narrative does hit a speed-bump during the later reels and of course an overdone climactic showdown with regressive melodrama.But the plot eventually emerges as the winner with genuine moments of love, laughter and heartbreak coupled with soulful music of Shantanu Moitra and witty dialogues.A noble story told with innate warmth and an engaging screenplay,PK revels with the endearing performance by its lead man,Aamir Khan who becomes the rationalist voice of the film.His inadvertent antics,the innocent questions that he poses, the protruding ears and all his weird mannerisms make PK a compelling character.Suitably supported by Anushka who complements him in each frame ,Sanjay Dutt as the Samaritan friend,Saurabh Shukla as the unctuous god-man and Boman Irani as the spirited boss, Aamir delivers a performance of his lifetime. Sushant Singh Rajput's character appears a slight misfit to the film's overarching theme but he shines in the cameo.cameo. Parikshit Sahni does an impressive job as the authoritarian father of Anushka, evoking a sense of deja-vu (father to Madhavan in 3 idiots!).Thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking, PK is a mirror to the ostentatious secular stand of our countrymen.It deserves to be seen.",

Yes,this time as well sheer magic has been created on screen by the two of the greatest artistes India has ever produced. I hope and wish Raju hirani to always cast aamir in all his directorial ventures as nobody can come close to do justice as Aamir has been doing in the last two of Raju's masterpieces. The movie is full of comical moments in a sensible,smart and at the same time, tight script and screenplay. Apart from the mesmerizing Aamir all the actors acted commendably well, music is apt for a movie like this which is taut in scripting and such a high voltage comical drama.There are too many messages given in here,but it doesn't feel like, forced upon the audience or too much of over the top religious and moral preaching as such. In fact the most important scenes are these many only,in which these indirect references of our over dependence on the temples,churches,mosques and their priests respectively, pointing out to make the spectator feel enriched with newly found confidence in oneself and the society as a whole. This is not over done or over the top in any manner as such. The only negative for me is the lips of Anushka sharma. All her scenes are dominated by her unnatural lips,in spite of her doing full justice to her part.I don't know why Raju and Vinod casted her for this role which can be done equally if now better by so many other talented actresses like Kangna ranaut and Vaani kapoor. Good job otherwise by Raju,Aamir and Vinod.Keep up the good work. I have not missed a single movie of Raju in the theater and never will. All should see this at the earliest to feel the best experience of cinema viewing in a times like this of trashier and crappier movies of Indian film industry. Once again BRAAAVO.......

Obviously the beginning was just miserable VFX. We did NOT need a love factor in the film, neither the vulgar jokes seeded in PK's innocence. I liked Ranbir Kapoor's cameo in the end(as an alien)though.The reason why Boman sir wore tracepoints at the news agency was again hilarious. Overall, the movie was yet another cheaply presented Bollywood film, which fails to compete with classics like Munnabhai and 3 idiots. It was only meant to help us recover from Prabhudeva and Sajid Khan horrors(the genres may have been different). The audiences need to evolve, Nolan will show the way!",

PK is curious about the way humans dress, as aliens have no clothing concept. When PK realizes that people dress differently according to the work they do and the environment in which they live, and that in itself men and women dress differently, it's not just a matter of dressing up, but an interesting reminder of the subtleties that man has in dressing.While enjoying, the main reason why a group of viewers label PK as anti-religious and atheist is only because of some doubts and questions that PK raises about the various religious concepts and rituals of human beings.Some audiences have accused the director of using Hindu deities and rituals for satire.There is one thing these people need to understand. The film progresses through PK's views and observations. There is no doubt that the majority of the religions and cults of the country of India where PK arrives are associated with Hindutva. PK only underscores the fact that religions that try to know the same God in many ways are polluted by human intervention. PK himself says that everyone is a creation of God.It is clear from this that PK is not an atheist. God has no role to play in fostering sectarianism among human beings. When PK says that God does not send anyone to earth after labeling a religion, it is not a word of anti-religion but a borrowing of the word of the true God, who values humanity.PK is a film that is sure a good rave reviews due to the novelty of the presentation, the performance of Aamir Khan and the excellent direction of Rajkumar Hirani.",

They want to find a little escape from the hardships of life, and come and watch something colourful and exciting and musical. Indian cinema provides that. So yes, the content of our television and our cinema is escapist in nature because we are there to provide entertainment. The select group of people who do make realistic cinema, who do make cinema perhaps a little more acceptable to the Western audience, is a very small percentage\". Non Resident Indians don't want to see super rich Bollywood's fruity arseholes prancing around a tree or park or on streets to loud disco music. Bollywood movies do not provide entertainment and if you think they do, I should feel sorry for your pathetic taste in entertainment. Do yourself and your family a favour.

It's a decent albeit overrated film which has a few great ideas but it suffers from some typical Bollywood song and dance tropes which frankly tire me. Aamir Khan's alien who is a logical being learns the ways of the Earth the hard way and realizes that only God can help him get back to his home planet. There are some hilarious scenes when PK mixes the religious practices and offends everybody but this segment is over an hour and a half long and should have been cut by half at least to make the film tighter and more focused. Also for a superior alien specimen PK sure isn't smart, if logic doesn't work with God 1, why will it work with God 2? Well PK realizes this by the time he reaches dumb religious practice no. 43 with God 7 or 8. I was screaming at the screen I GET IT HIRANI lets move the god damn (pun!) story forward. The song and dance sequences are boring and forced, movie would have conveyed it's message better without them. Other major gripe I had was that PK was trying so hard to be logical and then it suddenly became illogical. When did the motivation become from going back to home planet to saving the human race from god men? Why care about \"the wrong number\" or anything at all on this planet other than securing your communication device? This ladies and gentlemen is called a bad script. PK is interested in god as long as he is rewarded but then he chooses to expose the god man as a fake/dhongi so that people awaken to the fraud but why does PK care to do this? It's never explained. Aamir, Anushka and Saurabh Shukla are good in their roles but why is Boman Irani so likable in all his roles, it's impossible to hate this man.Other major issue I had with this film was the bad romance which was laughable and the twist was dumb. Which teenager wrote this? Hindi films have such high quality romance and this was pathetic, even lately The Lunch Box's forbidden fruit love between two mature older people was so complex and handled with great care PK was just downright dumb in the romance department. Overall I would say PK has a very strong social message but there are abundant issues present in the film which doesn't make it the best Bollywood has to offer, there are much better Hindi movies than PK, Ugly (the last Hindi film I watched) and Haider both released this year and both miles ahead of PK of course they didn't spend crores on marketing thus they probably didn't get as much coverage as PK.",

The screenplay is also very predictable, at times so predictable that my friend asked me if I had already watched the movie. Even the dialogues were predictable. That does not mean everything is bad about the movie. The acting is as you would expect from Aamir. He makes the movie believable, and the supporting cast does a well enough job keeping up. That Bhojpuri is a bit hard to understand, and I sincerely wish he had held Anushka's hands and learnt Hindi! The dialogues are the real steal. In India, whenever you question the so-called 'godmen', it's just inviting trouble. To go ahead and make an enjoyable movie out of that is truly an achievement.

From a Director and a Mastermind like Rajkumar Hirani what do you expect?? He is that one man who has BRAINS and he uses it wisely. He produces those ideas which we cant even think of or reach to that level of point. Pk is a story of an Alien who has landed on planet Earth and unfortunately he lost his remote and there's no way back home without it. The genre of the film was very tactful but All Hail to the Director who handled it gracefully. Pk is more of a Philosophy than film. The film has some very brave scenes like\u2013 money extracted at temples, gods purchased worth 15 Rs, coconuts offered in confusion at a church, god-men doling out tortuous advice, tying threads at different shrines, beating chests and milk flowing for gods etc. This all left him shocked that how everyone is trying to portray the image of God and the whole world is actually into a deep mess of lies, false religious beliefs & practices. At many points in the film one can grab this thing out that mostly people are using religion and the name of god for their ill- purposes. Clothes, Language, Color, Creed, Religion, the different methods of prayer do not define faith and while none of these things are bad in themselves, the film conveys that they may sometimes keep us from looking further.Aamir Khan did Justice with his character. No one could ever have done this, the way Aamir left everyone with Eyes wide Open. What a Mind-Blowing & Splendid Performance.

The movie takes a good jab at religious hypocrisy (In the lines of OMG) in a manner that would appeal to (and hopefully change) the perspective of quite a few people. The Plot is involving and development is good. A little twist thrown in as we approach the end. Certainly very thought provoking and makes you laugh and cry in parts.

Direction and scripting is so good that you can not point out what mistakes are there. It might not be a perfect film but it is a much better film. This is by far one of the greatest films ever made.",

The film asks bold and daring questions but the resolution of the debate in the film is underwhelming and leaves too much to be desired. The film makes you laugh a lot especially in the first half, which is its main strength. There is never a dull moment in the film as it is thoroughly entertaining. Aamir Khan made a pretty believable Alien.The social commentary the film offers is both insightful and something to ponder upon. Although the questions asked in the film aren't unique but been has been asked many times before. You are required to suspend disbelief that Aamir is the first guy living in India to ask these questions which were asked before by Paresh Rawal in the film Oh My God.The execution is well done which makes this not so original film(its a mix of K-Pax and OMG) quite entertaining. Although I do think it could have had a better written climax.A solid 7/10",

            "content": "One thing I have come to know about Mr.Hirani after watching all his movies is that he is kind of a jovial person who takes matters very lightly and innocently. You would see the same thing being portrayed in all his movies and that is exactly how we Indians are. He relates to us and we relate to him.It is not easy to picturise a movie over a religious beliefs and god but he does this movie with so much ease that you never feel any abuse to any religion. He takes potshots over all the religious beliefs, that are too mainstream and shows the hilarity of that and these are those things you see in your day to day life as I said you could relate to those.So basically I regard as a mass entertainer, I mean he makes movies for everyone , everyone can take something from his movies and all scenes are perfect direction wise. The climax was really tear jerking. There are minor flaws in the movie and the love thing is simply introduced to make it commercial and I being movie buff really hated this love theme inside this nice project. There were many cheesy scenes. The worst scene or for me was the kiss (Sorry), I mean you just let them kiss in between a song just for the sake of showing love and that scene is very bad. They hold hands and she does a spin and they kiss. It is like a 4 second sequence they shot for the sake of showing a kiss(Because youth!) I mean this movie has romance,humor,out and out comedy, drama, emotional sequences, youthful sequences, chase sequences, even twists. and even more which I am unable to recall now. He has even amazing marketing skills man. So he has delivered and taking 4 years for this script is justified. This movie is again shows you the typical Indian scenario and it is for the Indian masses. And yes he has keyword or promotional word for every movieMunna Bhai- 'Mamu' Lage Rahe - 'Gandhigiri' 3 idiots - 'all izz well' pk - 'wrong number'So there is actually no point of writing a review for the movie because it is being directed by Mr. Raju Hirani, so definitely it is a must that he would not disappoint. So just go to the theaters to experience a refreshment.Finally I liked the movie but I would like Mr.Hirani to direct some dark movie, because it would be sort of challenge for a person who seems completely optimistic at least fro the kind of movies he makes.",

            "content": "The subject of God and Religion is very debatable. When questions are raised over common religious practices it may often hurt many who have unchangeable belief on their own religion and blind faith over religious gurus. PK is such a movie which tries to enlighten one to go beyond a religious boundary in the form of comical laughter. In 2012, a film \"OMG \u2013 Oh My God!\" was based on the similar topic. However, PK excels OMG in all forms. Consider yourself as PK, who has come as visitor on this earth with no previous religious knowledge and the concept of God, and observe various religious practices, to appease God and Gurus out of fear. The idea is not new. Democritus, in the fifth century B.C. said, \"The ancients seeing what happens in the sky, for example, thunder and lightning and thunderbolts and conjunctions of the stars and eclipses of the Sun and Moon were afraid, believing gods to be the cause of these.\" Bertrand Russell in his article \"Why I am Not a Christian?\" supports the same idea. However, PK demonstrates all these ancient theories in a very humorous way, which might impact and awaken new enlightened generation. The message that no Priests or Gurus are to be worshiped, which is already a well established part of Brahmo religion, is again well dramatized by Rajkumar Hirani, the film director. The underlying fact that there exists no difference in Human beings to all religions is brilliantly proved in the film. But, the question remains unanswered: How do you change your fundamental religion belief after watching this film?",

            "content": "PK is the next film from the team that gave us one of the most successful bollywood films of all time, 3 Idiots. Therefore, it goes without saying that the expectations were high. Were they met? Yes, of course they were.3 idiots enjoyed a tremendous success owing to its satirical comedy and a clever and fresh take on the problems of Indian educational system. However, critically the movie was not as acclaimed as say, Aamir Khan's Lagaan but at the same time, the movie wasn't just mindless fun. It had the right amounts of fun, message and heart that made it the benchmark of a successful film that it is today in Indian cinema.P.K is similar in technique and style but the subject is different. This time, its religion. Its about an alien who accidentally landed on earth and in the process of finding his way back, observes the religious beliefs of people in India. Without spoiling much, how/whether he finds his way back forms the crux of the story. The movie is not eventful and not a lot happens in terms of the story but the director more than makes up for it with the treatment and characterization. All the characters have done their part very well and Aamir Khan stands out for a stellar performance as PK, an alien who observes everything with child-like curiosity as he tries to fit in the secular society of the country. Though some inspirations could be traced back to a few Hollywood films, he adds an eccentric touch to the portrayal and it does work very well. The music was apt and pleasant, though not 'pop' enough. Editing was very good and the director Rajkumar Hirani should be lauded for giving a movie that does not really waste time and utilizes the medium of cinema very well, just like his previous films. Movies of this kind are rare, we all can concur.Its easy to understand why the movie could work so well at the box office. Just like 3 Idiots, it has the right amounts of fun, message and heart, making it extremely suitable for the clever commercial movie format. But that was all. Pk raises a few good questions, none of them new. Instead of suggesting an equally clever way of 'solving' them, the movie becomes opinionated and could rub off as slightly childish, naive and pseudo-intellectual, all its intelligence lying in trying to ask the question right. As a consequence, though it provokes thought about contemporary fear-mongering, superstitious and idol-worshiping practices and rituals in the major religions in India, it does not give something solid out of all the satires, questions dressed as jokes and emotions partly induced by music. Unlike the first two films of Mr. Hirani (Munnabhai duology) that had some distinct 'hitting' moments that worked so well, there was no such scene in P.K. At the least, I couldn't find any. Clearly the director has a lot to say intellectually but there had to be some sacrifices made to make sure that movie wasn't preachy and is commercially palpable. That was exactly what P.K achieves. Would the movie have been as much successful commercially, if not more, if there was more intellectual 'content' about the subject it took up? Well, I wouldn't bet on that.So it goes without saying that P.K features Aamir khan's best work, is definitely one of the best films of the year and is surely recommended.",

The lost alien begins searching for his transmitter in a planet which is very alien to him. Meanwhile in Belgium a girl named Jaggu gets cheated by her love and decides to return her home country India. As the story progresses she meets the alien PK and eventually helps him go home. The alien played by Aamir khan is an absolute delight to watch. The way he lives his life searching for his transmitter thing, the kind of things he do to get it back and the kind of situations he gets stuck in are really so much fun. The first half of the film is realistic, funny and emotional. What follows is a second half which lacks the kind of realism in first half and takes a dramatic turn. PK who is very focused to get his thing back and go home, falls for Jaggu which kind of deviates the purpose of the whole first half of the film. The scene where Bhairo dies is quite dramatic and happens just like that in the film. Eventually PK gets his signal transmitter back but that happens in an even more dramatic way. The film in a way is a satire on how people believe in God and Godmen blindly, but that's just an aspect and the film stays faithful to it's actual story. Boman Irani and Sanjay Dutt looks wasted and Ranbir's cameo at the end is surprising. On the whole it's a good film with lots of fun.",

Note: Hidden spoilers ahead.First half-an-hour to hour or so is boring for me and only started taking interesting turn after scene where PK gives flashback from the prison. Maybe the initial scene at the desert could have been moved to the flashback story itself. Funny at many parts and bit offending at mockery of religious belief if you think your religion is offended the most. But the creator of this movie have managed to balance criticizing of all known beliefs in India by the protagonist who does not belong to any religion (not even by birth!). But whatever you try do in artwork that contain religious elements people will get offended without even completely comprehending/watching and start complaining based on what others say. And so can't help much with appeal for banning the movie. The mockery of white and black cloths and their difference in usage criteria for different cultures was extremely funny. PK's concept of middlemen/religious heads dialing \"wrong number\" to God was also funny. There is an awesome scene where PK brings people attired according different religion customs but was later revealed that each person do not belong to same religion according to the dress they have worn. These were in lighter notes and not that offending but some other humors will attempt get on to your nerve as the statements/acts made were very bold.The role of Anushka Sharma is very boring to me along with her hot- pants, bob-cut, duck-lips and her complicated love story ending up with a love triangle. Can't help much with Indian movies here as there should be everything in a movie with tragedy, comedy, sci-fi, musicals, action, etc in one package and then it won't end without a love story. Therefore ending of movie with love-story was a yawn especially with a phone-call from Indian TV show to Pakistan embassy in Belgium and representative at the embassy recognizing Indian female in a snap. All dramatic and filmy. The songs did not add up much to story other than 'Bhagwan Hai Kahan Re Tu' that too a little.The 2012 movie 'OMG \u2013 Oh My God!' is better take on religious satirical comedy drama than this one. The song 'Mere Nishaan' from 'OMG \u2013 Oh My God!' has some similarity to song 'Bhagwan Hai Kahan Re Tu' from 'PK'. The movie 'OMG \u2013 Oh My God!' is recommended watch for those who have not watched yet along with PK.To conclude I will throw one open spoiler about the title( :P ). The PK is not an abbreviation of India's neighboring country but derived from the common question thrown to main character by others as 'Pee-Kay (aaye) ho?' meaning 'Are you drunk?' which he thinks that people call him as 'PK'. And there is bonus scence including Ranbir Kapoor. Does not add much to the story but dialogue between Amir and Ranbhir is very funny.I am rating this movie as 3/5(or 6/10) meaning its worth watch but might have failed to make impression if it was not publicized as 'Amir Khan' movie.",

Trying not to spoil the movie's best kept secrets, the movie revolves around an amusing character who is far away from the civilization in which we live and he literally finds himself in an alien world. PK learns how to live with the limited knowledge of his surroundings and wins hearts with his honesty and childlike curiosity. PK relies on his learning quite literally and his actions are to the T which is not the way we live and hence at times he pulls a laughing riot and at some makes you question on your belief system. He shakes the ethos of many who are blind follower of the lines they have been asked to walk without taking any rational out of them and thus subjected to wrath of those who are blindfolded with their faith system. He unknowingly provokes questions which are seldom asked due to fear of backlash and gets people answer them in their discomfort.Amir Khan minus PK stands for nothing. This movie belongs to him, there may be many characters but not sure why their story was not well constructed or may be PK was such an overwhelming character that while he was on screen you couldn't notice anyone else and that's the magic of Amir's class. My biggest let down was Bomen's no show. He was always one of the best written characters in Raju Hirani's movie but unfortunately he finds no bravo moment this time. For me he was completely wasted. Anushka was more or less similar to her chirpy image which she portraits in every other movie of hers. Other than her changed look I didn't quite find anything new with her this time as well.While the movie was highly anticipated and was definitely top notch acting by Amir Khan for sure but I felt let down by the script which wasn't crisp and heavily relied on the spontaneity of protagonist. Parallels are to be drawn between PK and OMG and if I have to go by content and freshness then OMG is the winner. The analogy of being antagonist has been well played by Paresh Rawal and hence I wonder why Raju Hirani who is a class apart director went ahead with such lose content by his standard.The movie tries to weave multiple issues like Indo-Pak, terrorism, Godmen, idol worshiping, religion in general and fail to capitalize on any except taking a dig over Godmen and their fake illumine. I surely don't find any content being objectionable for which outcry has been raised on net. Creative freedom is required for directors to objectify their view point and that was done with sincerity without any planned intention to hurt anyone's feeling.

I agree with some points, but it could have been done a heck of a lot better.\nReligion has become a business for many and it's not just the Hindus. Religion as a whole is about power and control of the masses..nothing spiritual about it. I was waiting, that perhaps PK would meet a real Swami/Yogi who would guide him or provide some answers to him..but didn't happen. But unfortunately, as per the movie honest Hindu's or honest Hindu spiritual leaders do not exist,lol.\nThe movie goes out of it's way to poke fun at Hinduism and the people who follow it....and in the end PK says ' I believe in a God that created us'. What a big big joke. I literally had to laugh out loud as I thought to myself 'that's it?' This Alien believes in a God who created us..then that would mean he is not different from the rest of them he was poking fun of. In order for a 'God to create us', then it must be a separate being, which as HIndusim has thought me, is that the energy that became everything is right here present within me. \"aham brahmasami' Don't forget the relationship with Anushka and the Pakistani Muslim guy, another joke. If the character was really a Pakistani Muslim, then there is no way he would marry a Hindu girl from India...unless he denounces his religion and family. Get real people.Conclusion.This movie goes out of it's way to poke fun at Hinduism, without exploring what Hinduism is really all about. It does expose the fake guru's etc, but fake guru's are not Hinduism. This just goes to show how out of touch this so called 'bollywood' really is. I expected a lot more from Aamir Khan.",

A major aspect expressed was that we are a minute planet in the universe of billions of galaxies and to fight to protect God is immature as one who is so vast - the creator of universe does not need any protection. Mankind has been fighting of its own shallow ideals about sprituality in name of religion. One of the best acting, directing and screenplay from Indian cinema with deep underlying message about our place in the universe and the purpose of religion. We do not need an imaginary God, we need each other. We need hope and it does not need to be based on fairy tales, but on spiritual values that enforce humanism.",

Making fun of your nation,s culture ,relegion with typical bollywood comedy mix masala and its so called creativity by Indian filmmaker. If it called creativity world need to redifine meaning of creativity. The rating 8.4 doesn't reflect movie it reflect the mind level of dumb Indian audience. I am not amir hater i admire his film like 3 idiots ,rang de basanti, lagaan etc. Compare this movie to classic creative truman show rating 8.1 This movie doesn't hold a candle to that and still 8.4. Indian film maker should concentrate on story creativity rather than mix masala otherwise we should remain recognised as joke of cinema in rest of world. Sorry for English mistakes.",

But it wasn't long into the movie before I realized I wasn't watching it as a joke anymore. I was watching it because I was actually intrigued by it. I literally knew nothing about this movie going into it. I watched it because of a TikTok video. But I'm honestly really glad I found it. This crazy movie is actually really good and has an awesome message. Everything you see in the movie has significance down the line.

And going by what is Aamir Khan expected to do in each one of his projects, the expectations build up way to high. All this while (and even in PK) Aamir has lived upto this expectation. But PK cannot be compared to a '3 Idiots' level of epic, for 2 specific reason. Firstly, there cannot be another 3 Idiots. Period. No other movie can match 3 Idiots' brilliance. Secondly, PK did not have the novelty. A film with a similar concept released last year - Oh My God. PK is made with a good heart, Is funny all along, questions your blind faith and questions common sense but it came a year too late to the cinemas. Oh My God scored high for its novelty concept questions the same set of things. I loved that movie to the core. PK on the other reminded me of Oh My God time to time. Not taking away the fact that PK is funnier and Aamir's performance is a notch above the rest. Anushka Sharma looks gorgeous and has a critical role to play in the movie. I loved her performance and all her dresses :) Sushant Singh Rajput does justice to his part and so does Suarabh Shukla as Tapasvi Maharaj. But nothing beats Shuklaji's judge character in Jolly LLB. The movie moved swiftly in the first half and kind of dragged in the second. Last 20 odd minutes of the movie was a total drag. It could have been better in short duration. The last 60 seconds has a surprise for you, watch out. Songs of PK are a 1 time hear, nothing great. All in all a 1 time watch.",

            "content": "pk -Sins and Wins Movie Review The 'Sins and Wins' team consists of guys who have an inherent passion for writing, creative expression, and creativity in general. We write spoiler free reviews that receive positive feedback from our readers.The last time Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan worked together, the output was '3 idiots'. The last couple of times that Rajkumar Hirani and Sanjay Dutt worked together, we had the two 'Munnabhai' movies. This time, Hirani, Aamir Khan, and Sanjay Dutt have partnered up for PK. Obviously, expectations were high. Does the movie live up to the hype or does it provide just enough fodder about which to gripe? The review by Sins and Wins follows: Sins:For starters, we'd like to clarify that the movie is not a 'perfect' depiction of reality by any stretch of the imagination. There is no denying the fact that it has plot holes, even glaring ones. However, it would be fundamentally flawed on a viewer's or a critic's part to gripe about them. The movie is not about 'understanding' reality, but about looking at our version of it from a different angle. So, many of the sins that you will find in other reviews of the movie have no place here. Stating them as sins would not be an intelligent thing to do. The greatest analogy is not one that is completely accurate, but one which makes the most effective point in the most effective and efficient manner.1. Most of the songs are a 'bhaste of time'.2. The attribute that differentiates faith from all other feelings is that it is hard to break. It often leads to the development of psychological barriers in people who then fail to entertain conflicting ideas, no matter how convincing they might be. The depiction of faith as a fragile quality is hard to agree with.Wins: 1. Aamir Khan-Aamir Khan just looks possessed with his acting. You will have the impression that you saw only him the whole time. Acting without efforts! Clap clap!2. The roles and screen time of each and every actor are not without justification. In short, every sequence has that 'precision tag' nicely weighed and measured and handed out to you so that you love yourself for purchasing the ticket.3. We'd like to label 'Rajkumar Hirani' as India's answer to 'Christopher Nolan', the difference being that Nolan uses a lot of science and philosophy to explain his ideas, while Hirani explores and depicts important social aspects in a satirical and light-hearted manner.4. How disillusioned are we from reality, that we call upon religious 'gurus', a.k.a., 'managers of god', to provide solutions to our problems? A person who knows nothing about 'our version' of reality might actually know a lot more about reality than we do. This, being the principle motivation behind the movie, has been depicted beautifully.5. The movie 'exposes', quite literally, a lot of the scams that religious fanatics resort to in order to instill a 'flawed' version of faith in people.6. The movie never debates the existence of a creator. It does, however, throw some desperately needed light on the very important and the very 'neglected' question, \"Do we worship our 'creator', or our 'creation'?\" 7. The storyline which the director has chosen to have a shot at, will keep you on the edge of your seat always demanding for more. The topics related to creator, destiny and logic behind some crap presented to the society by dharm gurus and our understanding to the concept of 'co-existence' couldn't have been more logical or presented in a more practical way.8. The best thing about the story is that everything presented has a wonderful and impressive base. Say, why pk? Or, why Aamir's overly innocent looking acting as witnessed in the trailer? Or, why Anushka and Sushant's separate relevant sequences? Everything just could not have been more descriptive and accurate. That's what you call a perfect backdrop of all the good things about to happen.9. All the actors in the movie have acted amazingly well. The hallmark of a great director is that he makes not the characters 'come alive', but 'seem natural'. This is what Hirani has managed to do with the entire cast of the movie.10. The movie presents an unbiased view on all the major religions. Contrasting sides of an argument are presented.11. Hirani is just like a wizard, isn't he? Plain and simple looking scenes will make your belly ache and your lipstick ashamed of you. It just feels that, he produces a scintillating wave of everything which a viewer expects by springing life into a seemingly ordinary looking sequence. We would brand him as 'A great psychologist' of the 21st century', worthy of sitting on top of his profession.12. The movie has that capability to make you cry at the end mainly because of 2 reasons. One, there is heavy and justified emotional touch in the end. Two, you won't be able to see Amir's acting for another year. Alas!13. The plot is so fascinating, you remain very very satisfied and dissatisfied simultaneously, as you see the movie fading to its last few sequences.14. The satirical nature of the screenplay keeps a viewer interested throughout. Humour is an inherent attribute of the movie.15. The movie is Hirani's signature to an argument, 'Should we try something new every time we take to the reel?' When you see the movie, you will definitely know that the movie world certainly exists beyond business for some. You will witness things, you haven't seen before and that's a 'sins and wins' guarantee.Our rating- 9.7/10P.S.- 'It is an art movie that entertains throughout.'",

We follow PK on his quest to recover his stolen intergalactic transmitter which leads up to addressing the issues of religious superstition and fanaticism. The concept is very similar to Oh My God, but the execution is a blast! The pacing is quite fast, and the gags keep on coming continuously until they are interrupted by a song every once in a while. The movie avoids any sort of melodrama, but the plot takes a little comfort in coincidences. There are tons of surprises, and laugh out loud (fart-jerking) moments. The performances are outstanding... Aamir is extraordinary and Anushka shows a lot of energy. Sushant is charming and Saurabh Shukla is amazing. Also, Boman and Sanjay are pretty good in this movie. This movie has flaws, but one must ignore them because if someone keeps dwelling on plot holes, they will surely be missing out on entertainment at a grand scale The climax of this movie is twisted and seems a little forced, but i didn't give a damn because i was having a great time! Go see this movie.. might not be as memorable as 3 idiots, but definitely deserves a second watch!There are moments in this film where you'll be like.. \" Oh he's going to do that... oh no don't do that...\" and then, \" holy crap.. he really did that! \"",

Although i have already seen this kind of mockery of god ship in Oh My God! but still this movie binds me with the plot because of some really new concepts. At the end movie went on to the actual Oh My God ending and then Rajkumar Hirani brings the lost character of the movie sarfaraz back to plot and again raise up the beauty of the movie. Well this was a typical bollywood type but still i like the new idea of Alien, and i believe this really need a courage to make movie like this in India.",

The story was so cleverly put together that it made me wonder how long it might have taken to come up with the whole storyline. Still it was effortlessly put together, making every viewer stunned. Interestingly I also found big connections between the philosophical elements of the movie and the philosophy of the \u00dcbermensch by Friedrich Nietzche. P.K, played by Aamir Khan, had almost all the aspect and characteristics of Nietzsche's \u00dcbermensch: the curiosity, the childlike character, the (clean) view of the world, no morals, no man- made religion etc. This and all the other elements like the the funny scenes, the cute love scenes, the sad letting go scenes, the pure love of P.K, better said everything, made this one of the best, if not the best, Bollywood movie I have ever seen.

Great actors and a truly amazing director made a beautiful movie under a lot of pressure from patrons having made one of the best movies in Bollywood. When the movie started and the spaceship landed, my friend dreaded that it would be an ordinary movie, despite being an Aamir Khan fan. But within minutes his worries were gone. The way this movie gives an outside perspective on our ordinary lives is phenomenal. For example, we give and take money every day without bothering for its significance, but PK misunderstands that it is the photograph of the 'old man's on the paper that is worth value. His innocence is portrayed well by the fact that he tries to buy carrots in return for a bunch of posters of Gandhi. The movie makes you laugh and then after a short while makes you notice the truth that is portrayed. A few gags and pranks make it funnier than what it would be with only the situational comedy. The plot point of him falling in love could have been added to satisfy the Indian viewers checklist of things necessary in a movie, but nevertheless was shown well by the fact that he 'loves her enough to let her go' to the one she loves. There was a lot of anxiousness in a lot of people's minds because of Aamir Khan calling this his most challenging role and mentioning that this movie alone would outweigh his entire career's worth of movies most of which are very iconic and revolutionary. I was ready to be unsatisfied because I had huge expectations but it still went way beyond. It is bound to be a classic movie we will talk about for decades.",

Amir khan is the best actor in the , if you need proof, then watch PK. here Amir khan is from a planet where he has mysterious power. he learns local language by holding the hand of a woman for 6 long hours. after that he asks valid questions to religion system,where a widow wears white DRESS,but a Christian lady wears white DRESS during marriage. a Christian lady wears black DRESS when her husband dies,but a Muslim woman wears black DRESS forever. here people believe in cheaters who work as agents of god.PK reflects the effects of misunderstanding and after that in the end there is a successful love story, heart touching love story between a Indian girl and a Muslim boy. I will give 10 out of 10 to this movie.",

The movie is hilarious in places (if you have a sense of humor) and is enjoyable all around. The character PK's innocence wins over the audience. It's not in the least bit heavy or complicated when tackling a subject most just convolute and over sensitize. And it's not at all offensive. Great cinema !

            "content": "As a country of Vedas and religious tolerance, our society has evolved from a God worshiping nation to a God fearing nation. We have politicized God, commercialized God, incentivized God and sensationalized God (dedicated 24X7 channels for each variation of God). Bhagwaan.. Hai kaha re tuuuuu!!! Ee Khudu hai kaha re tu!! PK is not a movie with a social message. It's more of a retrospective question about our stand on God. Its not preaching a solution, but just nudging us to see if we are really on a right path. And who better to do this, than Raju Hirani and Aamir Khan. +ve points: - Brilliant script and narration. For me, the first hero of the movie is Raju Hirani. The guy has scripted it (of course along with Abhijat Joshi), directed it, produced it and edited it!! With just 4 movies, he has carved out his own genre of movies. Watching his movies is like reading an RK Narayan novel. It gives you that warmth feeling of simplicity. - Aamir Khan!! Goes to show how much a methodical actor can elevate a movie. Watch out for his expressions in the Bhagwaan song and the scenes following it. His childish expressions are so convincing that his buff body looks out of context! - Excellent supporting cast including Sanjay Dutt, Sushant Singh, Saurabh Shukla and Boman Irani - Bold marketing strategy of not revealing the plot details during pre-release. It's the old school of keeping the suspense of the movie, but it adds a dimension to the movie. -ve points - The romance angle between Aamir and Anushka seems forced. Their relationship could have been kept platonic with just the last scene in place. - The conclusion to Anushka's relationship seems cheesy. - The final encounter between Tapasviji and PK must have been more stronger. My rating Story - 1 Screenplay - 0.75 - Second half is not as balanced as the first Acting - 1 Other departments - 1. Music is very contextual and adds to the narration Overall package - 1 Total - 4.75/5 PS: Please please please make the sequel of PK with AK and RK in the lead!!! We need such a confluence of talent!!!",

Fantastic dialogues and refreshing storyline. Best 1st half in a loooong time c. Absolutely right about the concept of God (but am sure this opinion might differ wildly and that is fine)d. Hilarious and fresh way of looking @ things and how an alien has been used for this. Good philosophical points and observations Not so great parts of the movie a. 2nd half is not half as good as the 1st half :)) b. Could have balanced the religious view a little more on other religions too , but i don't have any problem with it : Hinduism is very visual (and am proud of it) and so it is natural to attract media attention and interpretationc. Bomman Irani has not been effectively used -- but thats a minor pointOverall it has a great message and well delivered (without being \"lectury\"), Aamir Khan has once again proved why he is India's finest actor and even Anushka Sharma was bearable ...Go see it !! and learn to laugh",

Right from Munnabhai MBBS through to 3 Idiots, I feel that Bollywood had discovered a Director that could create the perfect feel good factor in a film. And rather than the actor, the script and the director were always the stars of the show. However, having watched P.K. I strongly feel that if you remove Aamir Khan from the equation, then the film loses its charm. The character P.K. has been overpowered by the star Aamir Khan, which is a first for a RKH film (sorry for the very Asian abbreviation!). Furthermore, I also feel that, maybe even the director and writer may admit as much, not every possibility or scenario has been exhausted whilst constructing the screenplay and for some reason the film as a whole seems incomplete as a product. Certain parts of the film appear stretched and the narrative becomes very patchy; despite the usual voice over by one of the prominent characters. Perhaps my expectations were just too high or I have come to expect a higher standard given the names that were connected with P.K. Whilst I will not say that I'm disappointed with the film, on the whole it could have been better. I have therefore marked the film 6 out of 10, but pushed it to 7 for the performance of Aamir Khan.",

Aamir's introduction scene is sure to get loads of applause. The Foundation of the story is quite strong. There is bit of everything be it romance, comedy, emotion and yes magic in the first half. Anushka and Aamir both complement each other. There is Typical Raju Hirani trademark stamp during this period.Its the second half where movie loses it sheen. The whole logical quotient seems to take a backseat, and is overriden by emotions. Its the time when you start comparing this movie with very well scripted OMG. That Midas Touch of raju hirani does not come out in its full fervor. The whole climax scene does not do justice to the film. The film does not have the wittyness of Munnabhai MBBS, no emotional gandhigiri, no quirkiness and attitude of 3 idiots. This is hirani's weakest film to date.Overall its just a one time watch.

Although the first half was super funny, at the end I left the theater with an unpleasant feeling that somehow I had been tricked and led up a path of false conclusions by the movie. Making PK an alien was genius...It allowed a wonderful opportunity to see everything in a new light, questions things in an innocent way, and in the process realize the things that don't make sense-but we do them anyway- and providing a great opportunity to bring change.The movie could have gone anywhere, however, it chose to focus on organized religion and its follies. I totally see that sometimes organized religion gets stuck in rituals vs the essence of the teachings, and that fear & prejudice can dictate actions vs going inwards and finding solutions through knowledge and wisdom. I get that.But why choose a god-man to be the villain, and make the hero's moment of triumph in the shaming of the god-man. And why do film makers have such a level of comfort with Hinduism that a Hindu religious leader ends up being the bad guy. Are we saying that there are no such representatives in other religions who take advantage of people's faith for their own gains, or promoting their own brand of religion.Such things further the existing prejudices and take the attention away from the solace that so many can find thru knowledge, wisdom and spirituality. To me, that is morally irresponsible, especially from a movie that takes such high moral ground.No doubt PK is a fresh thought and different from other nonsense churned out by the film Industry, but in the end I feel its a big 'bhest of time'. My advice- don't watch it.",

Mr. Perfectionist doesn't seem to be complacent with his stardom & pulls off a superb show.

I must say he hit all the \"right numbers\" when it came to the most sensitive topics that are flagrantly masking most of the humanity. This brilliant piece of eye-popping fiction made me realize that my world-view is not an adversary to his perspective on life, but in fact, it is immensely analogous to his thoughts conveyed throughout this movie. Of course, Aamir Khan, being a perfectionist that he is, has shone humbleness on his fans, family and friends by his genius role, \"PK\" in the movie. The idealist also awarded Bollywood with a spectacular display of hope that the fandom does not require the myriad absurd and unrealistic action films. I am appalled with the social issues addressed in the movie such as the facade of \"holy\" people trying to justify their needs of saving their gods, as well as their disciples.

The story is awesome and fit very true in Todays India however a similar story was already portrayed in movie 'Oh My God'. If you haven't seen that you must watch this movie as well. I feel somehow the execution was a bit 'over' in every sense. Aamir speaking Maithili/Bhojpuri wasn't speaking even 10% of true Bhojpuri. Over acting in most of the scenes. Scenes created for laughter where most of the time the scene itself was predictable. Conslusion - Watch the movie but without much expectation and the movie would literally turn good. Also, do watch 'Oh my god' to compare which one is better.",

The movie has focused on all the main religions in India and pointed out their flaws, and how the connection of a human being with god may not be established due to these flaws. The movie also has put some limelight on the stereotype that people have against Muslims and that the Indians have against the Pakistanis and how these stereotypes are merely perceptions and not always true.

An absolute masterpiece made to perfection - an edge of your seat thrill ride which doesn't rely on over the top silly action but manages to play with emotions. In every scene almost the entire cast makes you forget that it is a film - Aamir Khan steals the show Anushka Sharma steals the show Sanjay Dutt Steals the show Boman Irani....... all gave ocsar worthy performances in their roles.It would be brutally unfair if PK doesn't land at least 8 Oscar & golden globe nominations! I went to the cinema with a blank canvas & didn't know a thing about it I am glad I went to theatre with an open mind & took it in as it came. Let me put it this way the trailers, posters & all the publicity don't do it any justice & its best enjoyed without any prior knowledge. Believe me it will take you by surprise.I am a really hard to please breed when it comes to movies & there are not many movies that have made me break sweat. Scorcese, Fincher, Nolan, Kubrick, Tarantino to name a few are some of my favourite film-makers, you get the idea of breaking sweat whilst watching some of their incredible productions. To mention PK even in the same paragraph with some of those names may make some people disagree. However, I believe it only does justice to this masterpiece to put it up there with some of those filmmaker's past achievements.Better than a solid 10/10 - do yourselves a favour watch it asap. Ignore those silly comments about PK having offended religious freaks who don't have a clue what was the true essence of the film. Enjoy!",

As much as I believe that religions serve as a great source of support to cover limitations of our brain capabilities to fully understand every thing, I believe more in weaknesses of majority of religions follower to include their own selfish interests and market it by painting it with holiness of religions.

If the contraption is gone, the alien is as good as dead.He looks exactly like a human being with a recently acquired six-pack. (AK in case you have not guessed), but is instructed by the controllers back home not to blink. AK makes an effort to do that and nearly succeeds.The alien can learn any language by holding the hands of a female for six hours without a break. He succeeds in doing that and learns Bhojpuri from a prostitute in Rajasthan. He learns all the terms cultural, religious and the rest. He can speak fluently, the nuances and all, but lacks the common sense to understand the concept of give and take.We did not expect a Jules Verne or an Asimov, but as science fiction movies go, Hollywood, and all ollywoods with B,T,K,M..., this is the bottom rung.ALL ABOUT HUMOUR Almost all the situations that were designed to satiate your hunger for humour, are either inspired from hackneyed themes or blatantly copied.If you really want to laugh, read OSHO jokes on religion,or watch OH MY GOD and the like.IN A NUTSHELL Raj Kumar Hirani, did dish out two reasonably good movies earlier. He thinks rehashing all the elements from his popular movies is a sure way to success. The 2 wheeler, the helmet, the long-drawn out kiss,familiar music bits, the talk-shows and all.You see Parikshat Sahni, you guess all his sequences together with the dialogues.The film, far from being original, lacks consistency of the main character. He steals money from a beggar, disobeys civic laws, knows to cheat and lie, and has a ready source for his fancy dresses-- innumerable rollicking cars wherein the couples remove all their clothes before they get down to business. He is a puritan, cheat, innocent, prophet-like,diplomatic,liar,and a buffoon rolled into one.THE MESSAGE:Can any one please tell me? I regret spending three hours(including the interval time) watching this much-hyped movie. Saurabh Shukla is a miscast in the role of Tapaswi.The character itself is ill-conceived, neither funny nor villainous.His assistants printout the comments about him from FB and Twitter and present him the files daily.I still give the film 6 for few saving graces like Anushka, the obvious efforts of Amir Khan, some good scenes in roads of Belgium where the roads are all for your self, some good shots in the desert of Rajasthan.4 out of my 6 go to the beautiful dance duet(thankfully no song) from the lead pair.Well-conceived, well-orchestrated, and well-shot.",

Everyone does a great job, from Aamir Khan's eccentric and simple minded personality, to Anushka Sharma's lively character, to Boman Irani as a comic relief. The promos may seem a little odd, but trust me, after watching this movie you will understand why it is so great. Also take into account, this is a movie directed by an Indian(hindu), and a majority of the actors are hindu(except Aamir Khan). This should not matter at all, but if anyone says this is an anti-hindu or anti-Indian movie, this should prove other wise.

When you make a movie, there is one thing that you do not ever try to deviate from besides crafting a good script which of course, no doubt, in this case, is woven very nicely with events connecting one another and making sense out of it and that is the projection of a scene. Barring few, the scenes looked very mediocre when there was actually much scope left that could make it look much bigger and better. In an attempt to keep it very realistic the makers have kept it very low ground despite retaining it's smartness, though. The desire to feel strong emotions remains unsatisfying and unfilled for it fails to draw a varied range of emotions. It does have substance but with a pinch of dryness. It does deal with societal issues but with taking up the same mantle of RajuHirani-esque style of story telling. Besides, one can draw clear parallels from Hirani's other past projects in this one too. For instance; In Lage raho, the catch phrases were 'jab koi bimar ho to usse phool do', In munnabhai it was 'jadu ki jhappi', 3 Idiots had 'all is well' while here, it had something to do with 'wrong numbers'. It is important to point out that in all those movies these catch phrases seemed to have come out very organically and looked in line with the progression of the story. where as, here it seemed as if some parts of the story had been played around this to fit the purpose. otherwise, why would an alien, such powerful to read people's mind, choose to believe a Tapasvi Maharaj who had PK's remote control in possession when all he had to do was hold Tapasvi's hand and bring out every bit of the truth.In some parts movie is exceptionally well and forces you to take a second look on how we perceive things and carve out our beliefs about God while in others you will certainly find traces of repetition.

I, personally feel that this movie is the best choice for entertainment. I recommend you to watch this movie in its default language, because the tone used by Aamir Khan (Bhojpuri) is simply awesome. Amazing source to be laughed upon. Aamir Khan is one of the best actors bolywood got. You will never feel a second with non entertaining moment. Apart from comedic part it contains some emotional part too. If you haven't seen then don't wait, go for it Right Now!!!",

Anushka Sharma's presence brightens the movie with her glamor and sweetness. Sushant Singh Rajput carried off whatever was given to him quite easily. Boman Irani's role weight was carried very well by him. Saurav Shukla's role needed someone who had done classy roles and he did not disappoint. Sanjay Dutt as usual looked cool. Parikhit Sahni played the subdued role well. Now, the filming unit as a whole needs the loudest cheers. Story- Flawless. Since it is a very difficult subject with religion and all, it was very well written. Direction- Could not have been better.There comes moments where the emotions run high but the level is maintained with light moments thereafter. Very stylish in approach. Much more can be written about the movie but in the end all I can say is that \"it is a very good movie to watch and re-watch nth times\"",

One may find little loop holes in the story-telling, but it would all be insignificant in the face of the perfect cast and the plot which has well hit the intended motive. It is perfectly nice family cinema complete with fun, emotions, allegory and above all a good concluding scene which I often miss in many movies.

In an attempt to give lots of messages (which too were pointless) pk fails to deliver even a single one. It has tried to cover people's blind beliefs, that is okay but it shows distrust between India and Pakistan, which is absolutely wrong. We Indians trust and respect Pakistanis and all other people on this earth and I am sure that they would be feeling the same about us so why create a fuss about a situation that doesn't even exist? The plot revolves around a key to Aamir Khans space ship which is stolen and their attempts to find it where they have tried really hard to fill humour and give as many pointless messages (already nicely given in films like OMG) but terribly failed.

A heavy theme I would say because it involves religion but yet it was presented in a basic manner.

The humour is just amazing and to give the jokes more power was Aamir Khan's innocence in the movie.Acting 8/10: I'm very impressed with everyone's acting especially Aamir khan. He needs to take one award please. Everyone else does a great job. Boman Irani, Sushant Rajput and Sanjay Dutt come in very short roles but impress in that short period.

It does have few good moments but that feelgood factor quickly gets spoiled and is replaced by movie's larger and subtle anti-Hindu agenda. For instance, our paan chewing PK (Amir Khan) is hell bent on discussing problems of just one religion. The joke really is that it's NOT the one we all know it should be. Anyway, nothing else matters for PK. Irrelevant things keep happening in and out in this movie. People get teary eyed on trivial issues like a cross border love story but hardly anyone bats an eyelid when a bomb goes off in a train killing scores of people. It gets about a minute of coverage in total. Literally few more minutes are spent showing a Christian pastor doing conversions, Muslim girl students getting fatwa threats. Stereotype much? Seriously Raju?By the end of it, some noobs looked content, oblivious of either their own standards (or lack thereof) or the movie's substandard plot. But largely everyone in the theater was like Meh! Lame! Concept loosely borrowed from the brilliant K-PAX (2001), PK is nowhere near it. In fact, I apologize to have even have mentioned it here.--------- OT -------- PK is a damp squib by our so called Bollywood intelligentsia who don't miss a chance to ridicule Hindu lifestyle and pollute the mind of our younger generation with emo clich\u00e9s. Catch em' young eh?I'd dare these pseudo-liberals make a similar movie centered around Islam. Of course they can't because they know their entire family will be fatwa'd next day. Maybe rightly so, I guess. Hinduism is a soft religion, and so a soft target.Raju and Amir, you are a bunch of hypocrites. Just remember, if PK was about Islam and you were living in Pakistan, you'd both be lynched by now. Be grateful that it is the very faith and people who you ridicule, have chosen to forgive you in their very own land.Oh and get some balls before you cowards direct another movie.",

Which is why there are bodies that can provide judgments, objectively, on matters we could end up complicating otherwise. Somewhat like a viewer, who can be brutally honest about the drawbacks in a film. Objectivity is probably what Hirani and his co-writer Abhijat Joshi sought to explore when they started developing the concept of this film. Hence the character of PK, one with an 'out of the world' viewpoint, literally. PK, the film is not quite unique in its inception, sharing space with a very compelling Oh My God (2012),directed by Umesh Shukla. PK, the characters, lands on earth with an intention to understand it. God turns into his subject. And in process of him understanding the power that made us all, he pokes at faulty notions that are developed and protected by us.Like his first two films, Hirani's PK is driven by a character and the way he functions. The most delightful part of the film hence is easily the protagonist. The story is about PK's pursuit of God to hear his request. Much like Kanji Lalji Mehta of OMG, who is told that it is only God who could answer his plea.The screenplay is woven to provide PK and his actions credibility. The first half is dedicated to establish his plight while the second half moves towards a resolution. Clearly the resolution proved tougher. PK has a brilliantly written first half, making it an absolutely delightful ride till the intermission. It makes you laugh and at some point it could even make the tender hearts cry! It entertains certainly. The second half is when things get loose, and you start drawing comparisons with OMG, which easily had a stronger second half. PK slacks as it moves towards the end, in contrast with Hirani's last three films. Nonetheless it ends on a perfect note; one which should leave smile on the viewer.Providing PK the biggest boost is lead actor Aamir Khan, in probably one of his finest efforts. With wide open eyes that never blink, Aamir is at his best. Anushka Sharma is perfectly cast. Sanjay Dutt, Sushant Singh Rajput add their bits. There is also Parikshit Sahni playing the disapproving father reminds of his 3 Idiots acts, and Saurabh Shukla playing the fraud God-man takes us back to his Batuk Maharaj act in Lage Raho Munnabhai. Not to forget the usual suspect Boman Irani, this time in a perfectly positive role!The deficit in the screenplay aside, the director in Hirani shines again. Every other department of filmmaking is top notch. Even the songs, which did not quite impress as an independent album, blends perfectly well into the film. It is a film that has the Hirani stamp all over it - an entertainer with a message. And of course it too has tremendous repeat value.please don't miss this one!",

I understand that he says he comes from another planet where people don't wear clothes. But why does he come in the form of a human? What was the purpose? 4. The entire behavior of Amir Khan is comedic. Why an alien will behave like that? 5. He is searching for God. But why is he looking for God where he should be actually looking for the transmitter? 6. Why does he stare like that way? Is it supposed to be the look of an alien in the form of a human? I am utterly disappointed and sad that Amir Khan could have agreed to sign-up for such a movie.

PK is a dervaish, he is actually not questioning rather he is saying the words we avoid to say, and he does that to shake our conscience to make us conscious. He preaches simplicity, harmony and fairness because the message is Man is pure, and chaste in his most obsolete and basic nature. Pk is a pure human, it would have been so strange to present him like this, so in alternate he is portrayed as an ALIEN. Our most basic nature is now Alien to us. No matter what Religion you follow, what your beliefs are, don't forget being Human. And all religions preach the same thing \"clear your conscience and you would find Him\".

He can also make you thunderstruck with his logical demonstrations about things you never bothered or rather apprehended to ask about. No doubt, he looks like a distant and conscientiously more intuitive cousin to Fungshuk Wangdu of 3 IDIOTS. 'PK' is another gem of Rajkumar Hirani's school of film-making where success can also be formulated by assimilating an unfussy entertainment of dramatic but simple nature & a 'never gets preachy' social message weaved in good humor and honest emotions. So when PK- the untainted innocent soul discovers people buying goods of their needs simply by exchanging a piece of paper with an old man's picture (our very own 'father of the nation) printed on it, he starts collecting every single poster & newspaper- cutting carrying his image. Next, we are made realize how we only respect the 'financial' worth and not the 'moral' values the man lived his life for.'PK' also dares to question your blind- faith on forged Godmen from all religions. It's high time we turn to humanity as our primary religious conviction rather than wasting our hard- money and the gifted wisdom to differentiate right from wrong on someone else's phony tactics. As PK says in the film, the God who created us is very different from the ones we created. And the prayers we make through these age-old practices are nothing more than a 'wrong number' call.The biggest strength of 'PK' is that it talks less and speaks more. There is hardly a scene where you don't get thrashed by one or other social issues or expected human behavioral flaws in us; in a very subtle, explicable, logical and entertaining manner. The Bhojpuri texture to the lingo adds to it fervently and freely. It is one of the most sugary languages spoken across country; still very misinterpreted and wrongly portrayed and performed for Bollywood films. 'PK' also doesn't do it flawlessly but certainly the respect is there. For a change, I am not offended this time!Hirani and Abhijat Joshi's taut and an almost flawless screenplay gives you ample hilarious as well as heartwarming moments. Anushka Sharma impresses with her sparkling presence very well translated into a lovely & lively character on screen. Saurabh Shukla and Boman Irani are efficiently likable. Sushant Singh Rajput is charming and plays it cool, though is only for a shorter role. And who wouldn't agree? The leading man leads like no one does better. Aamir is known to reinvent his acting abilities as well as the commercial cinema in India. This one takes his efforts to the next level. He gives us a multicolored paan-chewing character you will take home immediately.And if could give you more about the film, I would be writing it hours in row. There is so much to cheer-so much to cherish; you wouldn't mind it going twice in its first week. I am ready for the evening show. Till then; my only reaction to the film is if Bollywood is meant to follow the latest formula for recreating similar box-office success, are we going to see many more 'PK's in coming years? I am sure, the answer is negative. PK is outstanding & it doesn't come to us too often!",

            "content": "The first time when I saw the trailer of PK it did not amaze me much, it only felt like just another alien movie. Although the promotions never confirmed the role of Aamir in the movie, I was somewhat convinced by the trailer and the actions that he would most probably portray the character of an alien. Being a loyal Aamir Khan fan I cannot ditch his movie no matter how poor or great the trailer or the actions seem. But after the movie I felt like it's just another mind-blowing Aamir Khan magic that you would never forget for the rest of your life.The movie has an amazing storyline, well-developed script and screenplay, outstanding performance by both Aamir and Anushka and also some fun catchy songs that match well to the various stages in the movie. I would say its not only a must watch for true Aamir fans, I would rather say its a must watch for all movie lovers of any country or industry. Once again, Raju Hirani incorporated his magic and made this movie very special.",

Never thought i had ever say that Aamir Khan did his career best . And director also done a brilliant job. I just watched the movie to make bad comments about the movie. But after watching the whole movie with finding criticism in it, but ended up loving this movie. Amir steals the show!! This movie will make you laugh and cry at the same time. Acting, story and direction is top notch but music is also good. Conclusion Do watch the movie.. Don't be amazed if you see Pk 2 anytime soon :).",

I Entered inside Cinema Hall And This what I Got, Huge Audience occupying their seat and waiting For the Movie to start. The Movie takes Great Start with appearance of Aamir in the beginning itself, well i won't reveal how the appearance takes place and what is the story because this might spoil the entertainment for the audience who were awaiting for the movie and wanted it to enjoy in the theatres.The Movie keeps on degrading after every 15mins though there are several Twist and Turns. The movie might hold every viewers at least for 1 hr but then i started to realize that this is what i got after huge expectations, totally dull story and repeated many times in Indian movie. The movie even fails in it's climax. There are silly crackles of jokes in bhojhpuri which are not at all interesting. The movie totally fails and the 3 Idiots magic which everyone will be searching in the movie will truly be very disappointed, perhaps after watching Happy New Year and PK and also KICK i have no hope and interest in watching Bollywood Films, If Stars Like Aamir and SRK does such kind of Films then Bollwood will stand nowhere.Disappointment is what you get after watching this movie.And please viewer's don't take me wrong i am truly sharing my own review which i feels after watching this Movie.",

To be fair many may call it similar to Akshay Kumar's OMG, but PK is a winner all the way with good writing, amazing dialogues, and great acting. Aamir delivers a winning performance. Anushka is competent. Saurabh Shukla, Parikshit Sahni, Boman, Sanjay Dutt and Sushant are good. Better music could have made this a once in a lifetime film. Overall PK belongs to the director and Aamir. Definite Watch! Heard it somewhere.....only good aliens come to Bollywood and all the bad ones are reserved for Hollywood :)",

As I said before it would have been better if they had focused just on fake gurus and other religions where tolerance is extremely low.Can someone dare make such a movie? I am waiting. Another thing that irks me a lot is this imaginary love affair our directors have with Pakistan which is far from reality. That element was totally unnecessary and could have been avoided easily. Performance wise everyone is alright, I do not see any major flaws there, Sanjay Dutt's character was killed off apparently because he had to go to jail in real life and did not had time.

And hats off to Aamir Khan. It takes a lot of courage to make such a statement in this country as pk does. Challenging the stupid norms and rituals that our society has been teaching us for ages is like catching a star in the night sky and trying to push it towards the moon. You can think like you are actually doing it but it really never happens. So will be the case with pk. All of us will watch pk, realize what foolish activities we keep on doing everyday, laugh at ourselves, and continue doing the same activities. It is not going to affect our lifestyle in any way. But still pk is a very special film due to two primary factors. First, Aamir Khan. What a remarkable performance! It does not get better than this; performance of a lifetime! If you think Hrithik Roshan's portrayal of Rohit in Koii Mil Gaya is the best performance by any actor in a 'special' character, Aamir's pk will surely make you doubt that. The sanity and the dedication with which he has performed every scene in the film is simply mesmerizing. Second, Rajkumar Hirani, of course. His direction is superb. But the screenplay and editing is not perfect. A few scenes are rushed and abrupt. The Sushant-Anushka love plot has been dealt in a great hurry, which looks odd. Sanjay Dutt's lovable act could also have been a bit longer. But pk is very much Hirani's film and he proves once again what a fantastic story-teller he is! All said and done, pk is not a 10/10 film for me. There are a few disappointing reasons why. First, the antagonist, played by Saurabh Shukla, is not strong enough. It seems like an enlarged enactment of the actor's 'Batuk maharaj' from Lagey Raho Munna Bhai. Being the brand ambassador of all-the-stupid-stuff-happening-around, Tapasvi ji should have been a much stronger character. Second, the climax is hurried and not a very convincing conclusion to the issue has been put forward. I don't mean to say that the climax is bad. But it's just about okay. It could have been much better. Bottomline: pk is a film which none would even dare to make! And here they have made it and I don't know how! It is a very difficult film to make and has been made with near perfection. pk in my view is definitely the best entertainer in the last 5 years (post 3 idiots). One of Bollywood's best offerings!",

It gives strong message and full of entertainment.Every age group can watch this movie. Aamir was best in his performance and so was Anushka.A must watch for all Aamir khan fans. This movie can be called as movie of the year, coz very less good movies are made.Queen, Filmistaan, Haider are others.

The concept of GOD, an FIR against him, asking for a refund, finally a TV show where PK gets to speak with a religious fiend. Don't you think we have seen this already? When acting is concerned Amir Khan did a fantastic and an impeccable job, but its not always the acting of one man that makes a movie perfect, all the other characters in the movie are not well defined and their unnatural and incongruous acting is a big negative in the movie. I felt the director should have concentrated on them as well. Bomen Irani, his role was utterly undermined. Well again this movie is just an old one with a new packaging.First half of the movie is extremely entertaining which brings up the threshold of your expectation to its zenith, but the second half might be a little disappointing.This movie has a great social insight, which contradicts the boundaries drawn my humanity between religions and urges the audience to be united for that I would give 10 on 10.",

            "content": "If you are American and wondering whether this movie is worth the watch, let me fill you in. I have seen roughly 10-15 Indian films, most of which populated the Top 250 at one point or another. This is what brought me to watch PK. I've enjoyed several other movies featuring Aamir Khan, particularly \"3 Idiots.\" I didn't enjoy PK as much as 3 Idiots, but this one came close.PK is the story of an alien who lands on Earth. Shortly after, his remote required for the return journey is stolen and he is told that \"God only knows\" where the remote went. Thus, the alien embarks on a quest to meet God and find his remote, attempting various religions and practices to achieve his goals.The movie is at times funny, serious, heartwarming, etc. as seems to be standard from Bollywood. I certainly enjoyed the ride, but it may take a few Indian films before you are comfortable with the style.The premise is very exciting, as we get to witness a true outsider and his discovery of religion and belief systems in our world. I was impressed with the movie for handling a topic of such potential controversy, and I was pleasantly surprised with the film's final conclusion. I am sure that some viewers, like many of the characters in PK, perceived this discussion as an attack on religion or beliefs. But I think the film only encourages us to question the things that we are willing to do to promote our own religion, sometimes at the expense of others. This film shouldn't discourage you from your beliefs; rather it should inspire you to do things that are best for yourself and for others.I would certainly recommend this film to anyone, and I don't think it's a movie that's only enjoyable to Indian viewers. Indian, American, or otherwise, you should give this movie a shot.",

It is pointless to argue otherwise, it is one of our instincts.I myself am no exception. I was. at first, very reluctant to watch this movie. When I was asked if I would want to go to watch it, I insisted otherwise. I had seen some Indian movies which were not up to par. Some, really bad, too. But, a few rotten apple don't spoil the barrel. I was forced to go (Which is debatable). But, I am glad I went. This movie is a great flick. It tackles some of the most primitive questions. While the plot may have loops, it's questions surrounding religion, morality and religious discrimination cover up for it . Without going into too much detail, I would urge you to try to watch this movie. This movie would make you question morality, and the baffling holy war this world has gone into. Who's to blame? Though the answers may vary from creed to creed, the answer would be of the same essence. Is one creed really to be blamed? r do we all share a part of the blame? This movie may not be one of those types which would shake you down to your core and have action that would make you sit at the edge of your seat, it still would dive deep in your brain and heart, and be there with you.A great job with directing, and acting.

            "review_title": "And the crusade continues...",
            "content": "After stepping out of a Rajkumar Hirani film, one is usually overcome with feelings of optimism for the future; be it Munnabhai MBBS, Lage Raho Munnabhai, or 3 Idiots, each time he has managed to passionately uproot an impeding social issue in Indian society and present solutions to us through good-natured comedy and emotion. The result usually leaves one with the desire to at the very least think more about, if not contribute, to the issue at hand. Now don't get me wrong - PK is by no means a bad film. Rest assured all of the aforementioned elements are present here and in great abundance. Yet for some reason, it lacks the punch that the previous 3 films left you with. Why? Read on to find out. The film begins with an alien (Aamir Khan) being left by his spaceship in a Rajasthan desert. While he is navigating around, his tracking device is stolen by a thief who mistakes it to be an expensive piece of jewelry. Without the device, the alien cannot go home, so he wanders around the neighboring villages searching for the device, picking up subtle cultural nuances along the way. He stumbles upon Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt) who guides him through the desert and leads him to go to Delhi to search for the device. Upon reaching Delhi, he is mistakenly named \"PK\" and runs into Jagat Janani aka \"Jaggu\" (Anushka Sharma), a reporter who's on the prowl for an exciting story. Jaggu eventually comes to acknowledge that PK is an alien, and helps him to retrieve his device on a quest that involves great revelations about love, religion, spirituality and life in general. Now one may ask why my summary didn't address any of the religious themes that the film is being so greatly acclaimed for. The fact is that revealing these themes will subtract from the little novelty the film has to begin with. Unfortunately, PK is quite frankly, Hirani's weakest script to date; however, the reason behind this is not the fault of the screenwriters themselves but the coincidence of \"OMG: Oh My God\" releasing first. The punch that I had mentioned earlier is reduced to a great extent by the various similarities that PK shares with OMG, especially in the second half. While the manner in which Hirani tackles these issues is without a doubt intriguing, it simply feels like deja vu of the prior film. For instance, the innocence of PK's character being manipulated by the \"managers\" (as described in the film) of religion hearkens back to Paresh Rawal's character crusading (albeit in a humorous way) against the corrupt self-proclaimed gurus. Other weaknesses in the film include moments that are too drastic in comparison to the overall mood of the film, taking away from the flow of the story. At one moment, the audience is laughing like there's no tomorrow and the next moment is expected to be overwhelmed with emotion. The transitions lack any sort of smoothness. In addition, the music is little more than mediocre, with the exception of the catchy \"Tharki Chokro\", courtesy of guest composers Ajay- Atul. Music has never been a strong point of Hirani's films; Shantanu Moitra's songs for Lage Raho Munnabhai and 3 Idiots were far too minimalist; they seemed better suited for a minute-long ad jingle and lacked the opulence of a classic Bollywood soundtrack. The same goes for PK; the songs have the same structure and arrangements as Hirani's previous films and are almost sleep- inducing. I felt like I was listening to a CD of 3 Idiots on repeat! And the lyrics by Swanand Kirkire and Amitabh Varma are atrocious; words like \"Tinga Tinga Nanga Punga\" and \"Love Is A Waste of Time\" are enough proof of the level of lyrics we have here. It's time that Hirani start considering names like A.R Rahman, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, and Gulzar in order to improve upon this weakness. The other major weakness is Anushka Sharma; while Hirani's films have never been known for great female roles (the exception being Kareena Kapoor in 3 Idiots), Anushka is unable to make much of the little work she is given and simply repeats her irritating bubbly Punjabi girl act that we have seen her do in virtually every film. It's time she brought some variety to her performances if she wants to be remembered. Now don't freak out. While the list of grievances may be long, they are no match for the sheer brilliance of the one and only Mr. Perfectionist Aamir Khan. The man has this capability to turn even the worst of scripts into pure gold. Heck, he was even able to shine in \"Dhoom 3\" - and PK's script is rest assured much, much better than that! Aamir Khan breathes life and soul into the character of PK. From his spot-on expressions and body language to his crisp Bhojpuri dialogue delivery, he is a delight to watch. While this may not be his best performance in comparison to \"3 Idiots\" or \"Taare Zameen Par\", it is undoubtedly a performance to be remembered. Sanjay Dutt is delightful as the jovial Bhairon Singh; sadly, his role is far too short, most likely as a result of his jail sentence. Boman Irani as the well-meaning yet timid news anchor also provides great support. The supporting cast, many repeated from 3 Idiots, have also fared quite well. Of course, last but not least, Rajkumar Hirani does succeed as a director despite the many other flaws. His trademark wit and intelligence are present here in great form, and do provide for an enjoyable time. One thing is certain; PK is by no means a competitor to 3 Idiots. However, considering the other processed trash that has made the 100/200 crore club this year, it is a diamond in the rough. That alone warrants a viewing in the theater.",

            "content": "Everywhere I see, people praising Amir Khan and Raju Hirani for their recently released movie PK!I have seen PK with my wife in Gaithersburg, MD (That is 2 hours drive one way and crossing Washington DC traffic). May be I was frustrated by traffic that I did not enjoy it much! We reached at the last moment too - but that is normal for me!It was fun, do not get me wrong! There was never a dull (or should I say Lull) moment. The dialogues, comic timing was really good. The lead characters PK, Bhairon, Jagat Janani, Tapasvi were very well acted. Sushant did a Jimmy Shergill/Joy Lobo kind of role and he was good too! Parikshat Sahni was again in \"Kapoor Saab kya kahenge\" mode! Boman Irani was good too in a short role.Somehow, I was expecting some message from the film. There was a message no doubt but it gave me a feeling that I was watching Ohh My God Returns (I have posted that on FB right after watching the film - that is before it released in India). In fact Kanji Mehta was more realistic than our Jodhpuri alien.The music was just like Raju Hirani's films, going with the mood but only Tharki Chhokro impressed me. Bhagwan hai kahan re tu was emotional and Chaar Kadam was well picturized.I liked movies like Kick, Mein Tera Hero, Happy New Year more cause I went without any expectation (also had to buy some Indian groceries and some shopping anyways) but this was 4 hours drive just for this movie!In short, it is really a paisa vasool film and you will definitely like it. Would have voted 9 out of 10 - had this film released before Kanji Mehta's OMG!",

The movie goes on flashback and is somewhat shortcut.Watch or Not? Definitely watch. PK is a rare film; they do not make them like that anymore. You can watch this movie with your family too.FilmySansaar.com Business Verdict: SUPERHIT/FAADU/AWESOMEMy feeling after watching this moviePK is purely Sci-Fi movie in a pure Desi style but is totally different from any other Bollywood film. Rajkumar Hirani as a director and producer of the movie PK has done a great work as we all know every time his movies deliver a message to the viewers. The film is with full of comedy , specially those Bhojpuri dialogues and deal with human emotions at its best.PK will make you think about your life, how you live your life, about your misconception for the religion, etc. Amir Khan has done a superb work which cannot be replaced by anybody.In 2nd half of the movie, I felt like I am watching the movie Oh My God.StoryPK is certainly nothing you have ever seen before. Keeping in mind that suspense is a key element here I will not disclose any spoilers.When a heartbroken Jagat Janini (Anushka Sharma) returns to India from Bruges, she meets the unusual PK (Aamir Khan) and tags along with him on his journey. She starts a job as journalist in New Delhi who is trying to find a story worth telling but what she finds in PK is much more than a story but a dear friend who is stuck in a problem that she will help him solve.PK is a satire on God and Godmen(Dhongi) and also on certain simplistic ways of living that we put up with and when a stranger called PK questions these beliefs and ideas, the lives of Jagat Janini and all around her are about the film.STAR ACTINGAamir Khan gives his best performance. The actor is simply lovable as PK and truly the character's innocence drives you. The actor is known to opt for roles that are not simple and yet again he proves his acting mettle. He never seizes to lose our attention and he is just apt for pulling off this role.Anushka Sharma too is lovely as Jagat Janini. She is the narrator when story goes in flashback and it is great to see the actress come this far. She looks fresh in her pixie cut and is a delight to watch.As always Hirani's films have a knack for having amazing side characters and here Sourabh Shukla does much of it. He is excellent as the pseudo- god men that hit the headlines every now and then.Boman Irani and Sanjay Dutt too are a treat to watch even in their small roles.A special mention to Ranbir Kapoor for his cameo.",

His remote control of spaceship was stolen by a thief and he can't go back to his planet so he decided to search it. In the journey of searching he faces a lot of difficulties and learns about the earth. Actually film-makers want to show the viewers that how some people for their benefits spread fears and propaganda. Aamir Khans' acting is brilliant. Anushka Sharma and Sushant Singh acted good as well. Music is also very good. Although producers manipulated story to save themselves from the hunter of censor board still it is one of the best movie ever produced in Bollywood.

He never sounds preachy and has the nerve to ridicule the self-confessed contractors of our society. The essence of the movie is on the same lines with OMG! Oh My God. Anushka is charming and this role is a departure from her bubbly girl image. Boman Irani & Saurabh Shukla do what they do best. But the presence of Aamir 'Perfectionist' Khan redefines the experience.After every new release we say that's Aamir Khan's best performance but this time he crosses the boundaries of artistry.

The movie can be divided into three parts; beginning with a so not needed love story, super predictable and a total daily soap bit. You can easily predict what the next frame is going to be and that this would return eventually towards a clich\u00e9d Hirani ending. Then comes the second part; The Amit Khan part. Now, Amir Khan literally leaves you speechless with his extraordinary and by far the best performance of career. The story and the treatment improve dramatically during this part and uplift the entire thing, and you again and again admire Amir Khan, man! what a performance. Hats Off!!! and then The End; After witnessing the Amir Khan magic in the movie you are hit by a horrifying ending. and you have nothing but this expression on your face: Aaaaaaah... Why?!!! :(((((((( I literally closed my eyes out of embarrassment of the ending. Such a beautiful thing ending into something that was somewhat totally irrelevant, desperate, of course clich\u00e9d, too dramatic and stupid. And too butter that all up, the director adds the Pakistan embassy scene, Oh My God!!! and then it becomes too much to take. All in all a perfect anti-climax. I hated the creators of the movie here, and my friends did too. The poor ending however fails to overshadow what Amir has done in PK. Brilliant and touching. Definitely a must watch. Could have been much much better though just by improving beginning and ending only by a little. To sum up.Bad's: 1. Super melodramatic background music above everything. 2. Over-saturated Hirani treatment, same scenes from his old movies. 3. Anushka Sharma's lips and everything. 4. Parikshit Saahani's so predictable whistle. 5. Songs and dance.Good's: 1. Amir Khan 2.

With a cute short hairstyle and a smile that entrances millions of hearts Anushka Sharma proved to be the perfect ingredient in the perfect recipe. Following his own legacy Amir Khan yet again educates the masses through his movies. Touching the hearts of millions through simple questions. Inciting the think-outside-the-conceptual-boxes-in-your- head dilemma seems to be the near correct synopsis a person can give to this motion picture. Although many would be content if sensitive matters, like those confronted in PK, be left alone. But for the other half (and this is the bigger half) it was about time issues like these be made public through the most influential means. Astounding direction with the most entertaining cast assembled. Boman Irani, Sanjay Dutt and even Ranbir Kapoor making a last minute appearance all added to the spice.

And the Hirani/Chopra duo flawlessly depict the very same in a rugged Indian context. The nude scene of Aamir Khan (an integral part of the movie) and many more such scenes bear testimony to the real theme of the movie, which has been assiduously wrapped in a commercial blanket by the auteur RK Hirani. As a human being ages, his/her mental condition and understanding of the society/world at large undergoes numerous phenomenological changes, most fundamentally from compliance to cognizance and finally to deeper consciousness. This is what RK Hirani/VV Chopra portray in this movie, scene after brilliant scene. Now, a bit on the actors. A well chosen cast, appreciable screenplay and soothing music coupled with the \"P\"erfectionist \"K\"Han (I have a lingering doubt if the movie title actually alluded to Aamir's sobriquet) make for a kill. PK is a brave movie, a social satire and a call to change. India has seen numerous reformers from the Buddha, Nanak, Kabir, Shankardeva, Veerashaivas, to the modern day Dayanand Saraswati, Ishwar C Vidyasagar, Pandit Nehru, Gandhi , Ambedkar , Goparaju Ramachandra Rao, Jyotibha Phule, Ram Manohar Lohia et al. And each pro-changer has been humiliated, abused and villainized in his time by the no-changer conservative orthodoxy(though later they have tried appropriating the very legacy of these great men, once their greatness gets accepted by all and sundry). What we are witnessing today, the criticism of PK and the cynical attitude towards its message, is the old phenomena (the one I mentioned in the previous sentence) being played out over and over again. All it indicates is that PK is on its way to become a cult-classic, very much like \"2001-A space odyssey\" and \"The Seventh Seal\" et al. A simple question to those complaining of PK being \"anti-Hindu\" . The current government of India and your PM swear by hindutva. So, what exactly is stopping them from banning PK?",

            "content": "Two films may be too few to base a theory on, but it does appear that in Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani, Bollywood has found an actor/director pair committed to telling brave, relevant stories, the sort rarely tackled in mainstream popular cinema. After delivering a well-aimed kick in the pants to our myopic, rote- learning education system in 2009's colossally successful 3 Idiots, the team returns with PK, a film with very big...ahem...testicles. Operating in a country famously over-sensitive about religion, they've made a movie that brazenly ridicules our blind faith in god, and exposes the manipulations of godmen who feed off it for profit.These truths are skillfully illustrated when seen through the eyes of an 'outsider', the film's otherworldly hero, PK (played by Khan), who shows up quite literally in his birthday suit. PK speaks Bhojpuri, and has bulging eyes that seldom blink, arched eyebrows, protruding ears, and blood-red lips from permanently chewing paan. In the film's terrific first half, we watch as PK tries desperately to recover an item of great value to him that has been stolen. When he's told that only God can help him, he sets off earnestly to find God, discovering in the process our hypocrisies, our prejudices and our misguided obsession with religion.Hirani and his co-writer Abhijat Joshi craft clever scenes rich in irony, like one in which PK arrives at a church service with a pooja ki thali, or one in which he attempts to enter a mosque bearing wine. It's to the writers' credit that they successfully mine laughs out of scenarios that might otherwise appear prickly. We're introduced to other characters along the way, including a well-meaning bandmaster (Sanjay Dutt) who befriends PK early on in Rajasthan. In Delhi, he encounters TV news reporter, Jaggu (Anushka Sharma), who's at first fascinated by his idiosyncrasies, then promises to help recover what belongs to him when she learns his full story. But the screenplay weakens post intermission, when the stage is set for a (televised) confrontation between PK and smarmy godman Tapasvee (Saurabh Shukla). Hirani lays it on thick in these portions, and to be fair much of this territory was covered already in the Paresh Rawal starrer Oh My God. Moreover, the entire climax is hinged on a plot contrivance that sticks out in an otherwise compelling film. A hastily pasted-on romantic track between PK and Jaggu feels entirely out-of-place. Fortunately these speed-bumps don't derail Hirani's film, because even when the script fails, his leading man doesn't. Aamir Khan is riveting, and consistently endearing as the child-man who poses impossibly innocent questions that sting. Never reducing the character to caricature - despite his innumerable tics - Aamir delivers one of his best performances here. PK sticks faithfully to Hirani's well-oiled formula, and yet there is no question that it's a courageous film. Packed with sharp dialogue and genuinely funny moments that offset the lack of subtlety, it is easily one of the year's better films.Its the director's best since Lage Raho Munnabhai.",

            "content": "The management of AMC Rio in Gaithursburg, MD made all the desis stand in a queue, which was marked as \"for PK audience\". Our desperation for getting into the auditorium to occupy the most prime seat and reserve 10 more of those for our friends probably was their reason for such improvisation to let us behave and not do a black Friday door-busters during Christmas. While a couple of hundreds of us were waiting in the line checking out respective facebook or whatsapp accounts the previous show finished and another few hundreds of our clan started coming out of the multiplex. I was looking at them as if they were the winners of some sort of award, and me being a latecomer to the show whose turn didn't come yet.After about three hours when I came out of the multiplex I saw the same line of the fellow desis waiting for the next show. And now again I looked at them as bunch of lucky folks who are on their way to have a joyride full of fun, laughter, emotion, drama and many other feel- good emotions. And to top it all they are going to have this joyride named PK for the first time in their life. I, on the other had, can and will take this ride again but that won't bring me the thrill of the \"first time\", just like the thrills of so many intimate and personal first times of one's life. So here you go, I recommend you one of the most enjoyable movies that I have seen in my life, PK, a movie that exceeded my expectation in all aspects. By now it is probably needless to say that a movie studded with Aamir Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, Bidhu Vinod Chopra, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Saurav Shukla, Anuska Sharma and Sushant Singh Rajput is supposed to be a good one anyway, but what I (and my family and friends) got in return was a 24-carat jewel that any actor/director/producer dreams to make at least once in their lifetime.For sure I am not going to tell you the story. You know I am kind of conservative, but please be alert as every single friend of yours or the websites you visit or the blogs you read may not be so orthodox in keeping the story to themselves. So if any of those liberals will tell you the summary of PK in three lines (it is absolutely possible to do a three line summary) then half of the fun will be gone anyway. But even if you are left with the other half only, that should be more than the fun you got from all the Bollywood movies released in 2014 put together.However let me also tell you there is a chance that you might not actually find PK as enjoyable as I found it, as you might be the one who found cotton candy boring in your childhood or preferred to sit in the hotel the entire time while holidaying in a sea-resort. I am trying not to be judgmental, but surely there are some folks out there who might actually hate PK. There is already a couple of hash-tags to boycott PK circulating in the virtual world. So in case you love to experience something different, welcoming to new concepts, ideas and questions and love to laugh your heart-out PK is your movie. And in case you are a staunch believer of the concept that AIDS can be cured by doing kapalbhati five-times-a-day there is another movie coming soon for you, which you might like and you can watch the trailer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4OTT9T1Px4.Folks go to your nearest movie theater at the first opportunity you get, watch PK and have fun !",

            "content": "I went to watch this movie in 3rd week. After reading reviews and people opinions I was expecting some type of masterpiece. The story revolves around pk who doesn't know about religion and try to find his answers by general perception. In the process he finds too much confusion in searching the GOD and finally able to find true meaning of GOD. He preaches about the real religion and GOD. I must say that the movie was entertaining and engaging. The screen play and plot was good but with lot of loopholes. It is not as tight as 3 Idiots or MunnaBhai series where each scene is justified in the overall frame of movie. And as someone has pointed out the character development is not good. The characters are in single direction and gives the feeling of fairy tale rather than a thought provoking movie. I suggest to watch Oh My GOD which has handled the topic in much better way than pk. The acting was good. But some brilliant actors are wasted such as Boman Irani and Brijendra Kala. I was expecting more footage for them. Anushka Sharma was okay but nothing extra-ordinary.Same can be said about Sushant Singh Rajput. Sanjay Dutt was good. Amir Khan was superb. I am from Bhojpuri region and I can say that he has got his bhojpuri accent quite well. Anushka- Sushant love angle was forced and was not engaging. The last scene of the movie was pathetic where we are trying to search the meaning of true religion and GOD by some TV show and some cross- border telephone connection. There should be better way to handle it. You can watch this movie for some genuine laugh and comic scenes but should not be treated anything above that.",

But the storyline was what let this movie down.The situations were frankly unbelievable and the whole \"dancing car\" routine was like taking a bad joke to far. The first half was forgettable and the second was only slightly better.The concept was good but lacked the proper execution which caused the movie to drag on and on,which doesn't happen much in RH(raju hirani). The songs were passable and there were a few funny moments and i could see why some people might enjoy the movie. But all in all I expected a much better movie from Raju Hirani and Aamir Khan(especially after Dhoom 3)To sum up ,a watchable film if you have the time ,but coming from a 15 year old like me ,you'll have a much better time watching the last hobbit movie.",

If you have already seen something better, something inferior would not catch your eye for sure. The last sequence is very very childish, specially when in TV interview Anushka calls up Pakistan Embassy. PK finds enough money to live and clothes to wear when necessary from dancing cars! so many times and so unrealistic. Sanjay Dutt was completely unnecessary. I watched 3 idiots multiple times, even i watch it when it comes on TV. But this movie was like one time watch only. Music and acting was good. Expected much much better than this.",

Still the overall movie was a big disappointment as every story was clich\u00e9d and viewer was knowing what was about to happen. Characters were half baked and shallow and with expected ending. Though at the last moment there was some scope of some nuanced perspective but that was short lived and whole thing was painted as black and white with very little Grey. Though some satire were really intelligent take on Indian society's hypocrisy. The whole thing revolved around Aamir Khan and there was no scope for other actors. I hoped that they would give Boman Irani some decent role which was not the case. Sanjay Dutt was wasted they entire interaction involving Sanjay Dutt could have be more conversational instead of the cheapness. Coming to Anushka Sharma part was okay but it was hurried and to much with out any context was there. I have read some reviews that it was copied from some Hollywood movie.

Aamir is top notch with Saurabh Shukla and Boman,along with Dutt and Sushant but I feel Anushka could have been a tad better.

Also special mention should be given for the heart warming, soul touching song \"Bhagwan Hai Kahan Re Tu\", sung by Sonu Nigam.Raju's brilliance is shown by the fact that he could have easily ended this movie on a low emotional point but he takes the effort of a time leap to leave you smiling and positive of meeting a PK in your life.

            "content": "Rajkumar Hirani's first film in five years is a warm, funny and piercingly provocative satire that should blow the blues away. It is the kind of full-blooded but genteel entertainer that should get us all into just the right frame of mind to usher in Christmas and bid adieu to a year that has seen us celebrate ugly excess on all fronts with unseemly glee. PK, buoyed by a magnificent script and outstanding acting all around, is an uplifting fantasy that springs a surprise at every turn but never overplays its hand. It comes as close to storytelling perfection as any mainstream Hindi movie has done in living memory.It has great songs, beautifully filmed musical set pieces, brilliant pacing and nary a moment that flags. As a cinematic send-up on Gods true and fake, PK pulls no punches at all and speaks its mind like a carefree child that has just learnt to talk and make sense of the world. But this hard-hitting critique of all that ails a nation that seems to have lost its human moorings and is in blind pursuit of false panaceas remains good-natured all the way through.The screenplay by Hirani and Abhijat Joshi demands a degree of willing suspension of disbelief, especially when it comes to a few of the pivotal coincidences that drive the narrative. The characters and the crucial dramatic and comic moments are, however, informed with such infectious warmth and beauty that nothing that the plot throws up is ever in danger of ringing overly false.The five-year hiatus between 3 Idiots and this film has clearly served them well. The screenwriters have worked a delicately crafted love story into the taut tapestry of PK, thereby lending it an emotional dimension that usually eludes a high-minded satire. Even the principal antagonist in PK, Tapasvi Maharaj, played superbly by Saurabh Shukla, isn't an ogre designed to evoke disgust.PK is out to provoke but not to shock. The film asks questions via its idiot savant protagonist, but does not attempt to deliver facile, absolute answers. And that makes it all the more effective. PK is propelled primarily by Aamir Khan's delightfully droll superstar turn as a nameless seer from outer space who is stranded on Planet Earth - in Rajasthan and Delhi to be precise.This is an unlikely saga of an alien who lands in the desert completely naked like a new-born baby and then proceeds to acquire the ways of human adults in a bid to survive in a hostile environment. His fate hinges on whether he can regain a stolen gadget that he needs in order to return to his home light years away and cling on to his purity as his brushes with mankind becomes increasingly hazardous.In one of the film's quirkiest scenes, he learns the language of humans by drawing words out of the mind of a sleepy Bhojpuri- speaking sex worker that he is led to by his only friend in the desert of Rajasthan, band master Bhairon Singh (Sanjay Dutt).",

This story could have been used to influence mindsets across by building on its dark side like the opening scene promises but Hirani takes the same route he has traveled for his last two films and gets a significant amount of laughs but doesn't provide the depth of his previous two absolute masterpieces. This time, his simple humor and exotic characters couldn't hold together what he tries to portray in the film. While he does put forth a very relevant issue in our decorated but flawed Indian Culture, he relies on making the majority of audience happy by giving them a few laughs first and then get straight to controlling them by presenting the reality behind their mindset. This worked brilliantly well for lage raho and 3 idiots because the medium of comedy was well suited to the characters of munnabhai and rancho. Here there was no real need to stick to the same technique, like I said, he did get a good laughs but people unknowingly laughed to dark humor if you see the film and carefully observe the scenes in the first half of the main lead. Hirani chases humor with this story which is not comic in nature unlike his previous two where it came naturally and ends up getting distracted at times. It is difficult to get absorbed by the plot which is not multi-dimensional and relies on techniques used in previous two films. There would have been immense scope had Hirani didn't make himself constrained by need to please everyone with simple humor and a relevant topic in the society. He could have been more influential with a more darker approach to the story with strong emotions against the main character. There are positives to the films in the name of Aamir, it can't get better than this. He delivers again, this time without Hirani, he still shines brighter than the film put together.

On this topic the movie needs to be sensitive to focus and address the core issues where the situation and intent needs to be corrected, but carefully avoiding crafting a comedy on the basic core beliefs. E.g. go strong on superstitions, dong is, wrong practices, but be careful not to hurt basic beliefs on gods.( not to make fun of Lord Shiva, which is score belief of Hindus, which is where the problem here lies)But being a Hindu, the basic tenets it has taught me is religious tolerance, and openness. This I see also in a wide dispersion, but considering this to be a weakness where someone can experiment and cash out in media space is not a good idea.4. The movie does badly on point 3, and hence in rate only a 3",

            "content": "As Yenn Martel said, 'that Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.'Rajkumar Hirani's PK, the highest grossing Bollywood movie has definitely earned its fame. The outline of the movie is an estranged alien on Earth (receiving a very warm welcome), who is initially on a research mission but is now trying to retrieve his stolen locket, which is a beacon to his spaceship in order to return home. First of all, hats off to the script by Hirani and Abhijat Hoshi. The much hype around the film is what got me curious in the first place. Generally, Indians scowl when they meet someone from Pakistan. Ever wondered why? The film begins with this concept. Where is the label that marks us as Asians or Europians? We are the ones who made these divisions. So is the case of religion. Now, that is a touchy subject but the movie holds no restraints to discuss this. There are two Gods; the God who created us and the God we created. Which one are we to believe in? A star studded cast comprising of Aamir Khan, Anushka Sharma, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla, Sushant Sing Rajput and even a cameo by Ranbir Kapoor keeps you hooked on. There is no time for boredom or dare I say relaxation during this movie. You will definitely have tears from laughing. Things seem to go by in a whirl but everything is crystal clear. Those questions that we try to curb in our minds are blatantly asked by PK. There are times when I ask myself, 'Why are we the way we are?' And I'm glad that the creators of this film have the same thoughts. Have you ever wondered a world without God? Aren't there times when we question His existence? As the antagonist in this story said, people would slit their wrists and jump off buildings in the absence of hope. Hope is the element that keeps us going and that is why we need God. PK raises so many questions and gets us thinking as well as relating. In my opinion, the movie portrays our minds, pure and transparent. Like PK, we come into the planet as a child with an open mind. But as we grow, we are conditioned to think and be in a particular manner. It is only a handful of us that inquire the need for segregation. One of the many quotes that stuck with me was, 'Faith is fashion related'.All the songs are very apt to the individual scenarios, and Sonu Nigam's voice was a blessing to listen to. I'd even give it another go..P.s. I found a lot of similar concepts and questions from the novel The Life of Pi. Those who have read this book and watched PK might be able to relate the two. This does not mean they have plagiarized the contents. The thoughts and actions are very raw in both the sources and they deal with same matter of religion, God and hope.",

            "content": "Watched PK.Mesmerized!!!!! There are many kinds of hypocrisy within the human civilization on earth...PK is a small but an awesome attempt to hit our minds against many of them.I had an idea from my different friends and acquaintances who watched PK is that it's against the religious hypocrisy and religion-based politics/business only that was already shown beautifully in the film OMG.. But NO; that's just a part of it. It has such a wide spectrum and the most intriguing among all the hypocrisies is what has been shown at the very last part.Even if you free yourself from religious superstitions, it's too hard to get rid of the 'hypocrisy of love'. The hypocrisy of love is seated in the fact that the very concept has become interchangeable with that of lust. While Love Expands mind; Lust Contracts.For young people, mostly lust is indistinguishable from love. The real Love never captivates, but frees and in a real love-relation, both are free, both are attached only through the bond of love;nothing else.Here we 'love' to have chicken means we love to eat the flesh of chicken. And perhaps the same concept of love is in the sub-conscious of many people when it comes to human also. This is the Hypocrisy of Love in this world.True religion teaches to take care of others around, True civilization strives for betterment of people's life as a whole, True sages tell people to find God within oneself and in all beings, True Love makes people want their love to Be with their love, whatever and whoever that Love is.Kudos to the director Rajkumar Hirani, and of course Amir Khan(PK) and Anushka Sharma(Jaggu) for their fabulous acting! In a very small span, Sanjay Dutt (Bhairon Singh) also caught our mind. Kudos also to Shantanu Moitra and Swanand Kirkire for those awesome songs that along with the situation in the film can make anybody dance in the same way as PK did ;) :D",

It has never been said before and hits the spot. There are some loopholes in the movie and more attention to detail was needed. In the movie he learns about our world by holding the hands of a girl . His hands are like usb and draws in all the information. He gains this knowledge and experience and yet he has this wide eyed and innocent expression . why ?..Overall its a good movie with an important message but in the end it just misses 10 mark",

The movie has a compelling story line for an alien who off-guards get trapped on planet earth and lands in India losing his special device ( a stone) which is his key to return to his home planet. He learns and looks for God as Indians are all over seen praying in temples to numerous different idols and sees high ranked religious people are making religion a business. The movie is quite a sensitive subject actually with a touch of sarcasm in a pure form of raw humour on the problem of Indians trying to put their faith in handmade stone idols they then call Gods.

Another sad part is when an Indian Hindu woman Jaggu falls in love with Pakistani Muslim man Sarfaraz. Her father disapproves because of his religion and his guru Tapasvi Ji predicts that Sarfaraz will betray her. She asks him to marry her anyways but at the church, she receives a Dear John note telling her not to call him. Heart broken, she returns to New Delhi and becomes a tabloid reporter. One day on the subway, she encounters PK passing out flyers looking for God. He has the craziest tale to tell.A superb movie asking all us all to take care of humanity rather than just religion.

Would you have a different opinion if the movie was from Abhishek Bacchan or Hrithik Roshan or some other generic Hindu sounding actors (instead of Aamir Khan)?-If you strongly believe that the movie was funded by some Muslim organization or country that is out to malign Hinduism.-If you are afraid that by seeing the movie, your deeply held beliefs could be altered. I personally am under no illusion that people's minds will be changed by merely watching a movie (that too\u0085 on the topic of deep rooted faith)!-If you feel that for all the time spent in the movie, on Hindu rituals and fake gurus, an equal amount of time should be spent on similar aspects of Christianity and Islam (money grubbing televangelists, molesting catholic priests, Taliban and Boko Haram should be given equal time?)-If you are offended by male actors showing off their well-toned bodies (almost) in the buff. Remember, they never show Aamir Khan totally naked. There is always a branch or a Boom box that is strategically placed. So, maybe it's the allusion to male nudity that is the problem for some folks. Meanwhile, there are several such portrayals of women which are usually met with whistles of approval. There are routine and gratuitous displays of blood and gore and disemboweled bodies in movies as well as TV news, magazines and newspapers. This seems quite acceptable. No one is worried about the negative impact of these on impressionable young ones.If you fall into any of the above categories, please DO NOT go see this movie! It will ruin your day for sure!!The movie is not attacking Hinduism. It is not even attacking all gurus, babas or spiritual teachers. It is highlighting some specific kind of babas and religious practices. Why not assume that your particular baba is the \"good kind\"? One who is merely preaching love for all, universal brotherhood, peace, tolerance etc. Not that kind who is always trying to relieve you of your material burdens (e.g., cash or jewelry). In fact, I understand that some of the sayings and ideas used in the movie are from popular religious teachers.This whole \"alien from another star/planet\" stopping by, is a very clever vehicle for the director/writer to ask some \"innocent\" questions about religion, faith etc., which, if asked in any other context would get you thrown out (maybe even get you beat up, just to underscore that we are \"peaceful and non-violent\" people). Religion generally requires that you suspend critical thinking and curiosity. The PK character does exactly the opposite in the movie.I thought that the overall treatment of the topic was fairly even handed by the writer and the director. They did not go off and question the existence of a creator. They just questioned some intermediaries (agents) between the creator and the created.If the worst thing that can happen from watching this movie is that we start questioning instead of blindly following, not just in matters of faith, but in all aspects of our life, then we will be a much more enlightened and tolerant society.Sure, that whole affair with Sarfaraz in the beginning and the melodrama at the end with the conference call with Pakistani consulate staff seemed too sappy and formulaic! But, hey.. this is still a Bollywood movie and you just have to take certain aspects of it on blind faith (in the director's abilities to satisfy box-office appeal). Couple of the song and dance sequences looked good on the big screen but none of them so catchy that I would remember after a day.All in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable and funny movie. A perfect dessert after a sumptuous New Year's lunch! Compared to Aamir's earlier movies, I would rank this slightly below \"Taare Zamin Par\" and \"3 Idiots.\"As we walked out, we heard the conversation of couple of older white ladies who were in the theater with us\u0085 \"Wow! What a wonderful movie\", \"What a great way to start the New Year!\", \"I wonder why it only got 87% on the Rotten Tomatoes website?\" One of them even asked me as we exited the theater, \"How did you hear about this movie?\", before we could ask them that same question!!If you have not seen the movie and if you are currently blasting the movie (and/or vandalizing movie theaters in India) for its negative portrayal of your particular religion (based on inciting views from others), then please DO NOT go see this movie, as it could sap the energy out of your righteous indignation!!",

Aamir Khan has again done a superb job as a Alien protagonist of the film who has come from different Gola(Planet). Overall it is a \"Not To Miss\" movie. As a lead heroine Anushka does good. Sanjay Dutt was best in his short role/ The funniest part of the film was when PK(Aamir) tells his survival and Learning times on earth to Jaggu(Anushka). And then Aamir tells the different ways of saying Accha(Oh really) depending on the situation and moods, was hilarious :). Kudos to Rajkumar Hirani(Director) for giving audiences back to back enormously Entertaining Films with social messages engraved in them so beautifully that it does not miss the bus. Go watch this movie to fetch your share of happiness!!",

I urge every one of us should go and watch this movie and not give any heed to the critics calling it similar to another movie (although I haven't seen anyone giving ears to them). The movie starts itself with a Social Satire (very few spotted that, I think) and along with it starts a beautiful and adventurous journey of a \"human look alike\" alien on Earth. The Movie moves along very smoothly to its completion, while showcasing and highlighting various loopholes (if I am allowed to say that) in Religious structure (spec. w.r.t. Indian) all along the storyline. Well, there are lot of nitty-gritty details which can be found missing, but this is NOT a SCI-FI movie so avoid getting into that loop of finding the errors, otherwise you will end up losing great moments of comedy, drama, romance, innocence and at the end will be wishing the other way around. Even if you don't want to get loaded with \"satirist\" drama, just go and watch the movie with an open mind. I Bet, on course of all the laughing and crying throughout, at the end of it there will be a good small tiny positive change in you.",

            "content": "Mr. Aamir Khan, honestly speaking, you never cease to amaze me. I had once thought that you had reached the pinnacle of your career with films such as Lagaan, RDB, TZP and 3 Idiots, and that you simply cannot get any better than what you had already done in the past. But I was wrong. PK takes everything to newer and greater heights. It is an incredibly superior cinematic journey than all the four films mentioned above, and much more than that. I am still in a daze. It is rare for me to come back home at 1-30 in the night and immediately pen down my feelings. But I just cannot help it, because it is that kind of a movie!Mind you, this movie is not for you if you are offended when somebody questions your blind beliefs and superstitions. It is not for you if you think that human beings can be segregated and divided based on artificial barriers of caste, creed and religion. It is not for you if you believe that keeping a 100 rupees note in front of a lifeless statue is more worthwhile than keeping it in front of a starving little child. It is not for you if you identify with a fellow human being because he is Hindu/ Muslim / Christian/ Sikh, but not because he is simply a fellow human being who deserves to be loved.But yes, this is YOUR kind of movie if you simply believe that 'Humanity' is the greatest religion of all. This is YOUR kind of movie if you believe that divinity is present inside each of us, and that loving the people who surround us is equivalent to worshiping a thousand gods.So take your pick and choose wisely. Once you've made your choice in the affirmative, don't waste a moment's time before catching up on what could very well turn out to be the film of the decade!",

So 10 stars is for the WRITER Rajkumar Hirani,Abhijit Joshi, Sreerag Nambiar for coming up with this wonderful interesting story.. I haven't watched OMG movie which have a similar theme (people says) .. to me Pk seems to be Unique and Interesting even though I knew Amir Khan is an LOST ALIEN!! on EARTH in the movie.. ((there it is..ALIEN !!! that's ALL.. for spoilers )) i thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the film. Everyone in the movie acted beautifully.. i mean no one is boring with any crappy dialogues or scenes... not all songs in the movie are pleasing .. and (SPOILER...) alien ship landing VFX is Nice but don't expect AVATAR LIKE VFX in through out movie it's not that kind of a package... The movie revolves around a simple thought of HOW TO CONTACT GOD.. Amir khan's character in the movie is looking for a way to contact GOD in order to ask the GOD to help him to retrieve his lost COMMUNICATOR WITH HIS SPACESHIP..and movie shows how he ends up in this quest for finding a way to contact GOD and did he FIND A WAY AT ALL!!?? that's what this movie made me so interesting to WATCH.. so do not miss it...",

With PK, Hirani signs off as a facile comedy director who needs no double-meaning garbage, tactically created scenes to burst his audience into laughter. With movies like Munna Bhai MBBS (2003), Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006), 3 Idiots (2009) and PK(2014) lately, he amongst the select few gifted directors far and wide, capable of delivering original, seamless piece of facetiousness that leaves you with a thought-provoking message in the end. For PK, it is one such movie that re-ignites the hope of quality in Bollywood, which for that matter has been predominantly plagued by copied, pathetic, vulgar and senseless stuff. Crisp storyline, flawless direction and amazing performances make PK one-of-its kind, not unlike Hera-Pheri. Truly, Aamir is a perfectionist and Anuskha has loads of talent. The movie has a simple story line about humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go. It shows the world from the eyes of a stranger, an Alien \"Aamir Khan\" this time, who asks questions that no one has asked before. Who seeks reasons for the way society has set its ways over thousand of years. The childlike curiosity of PK, supported by beautiful and smart Anushka Sharma transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others alike. Go and do watch PK! Laugh out loud and take away some simple truths of life, we often overlook in our daily lives.",

            "review_title": "An entertaining but flawed film carried superbly by Aamir Khan",
            "content": "Although the film has few flaws in its story-telling, PK is more than watchable because of its great comic moments and for taking up a subject, Religion, which for a long time in its history, bollywood had decided to steer clear of. And there are good reasons for it. Movies which have religion as its subject matter always tend to be controversial. We are seeing the same thing with PK with many suits being filed which thankfully the courts have dismissed quickly.In a year where we have had a very short supply of quality movies, PK will come as a breath of fresh air. Just like his first three films, Rajkumar Hirani again takes up a socially relevant subject and laces it with humor and idiosyncratic situations. We would find many of Hirani's trademarks in this movie. The central character who is a misfit who gets mocked at the beginning before winning everyone's hearts one by one and ends up being the agent of change. The main antagonist is not an evil person but one who has misguided beliefs. The film is a combination of laughing-out loud moments and some tear-jerking moments.Whereas the comic moments are as laughable as was the case with Munnabhai and 3 Idiots, it is the emotional moments where it comes up short. And the major reason is that the movie doesn't devote enough time in fleshing out the relationships between the characters. Case in point, Anushka and Sushant's romance and break- up and also Anushka's relationship with his father. Also, except for Aamir and Anushka's characters, most of the supporting characters don't have much to do which is highly unfortunate for a cast with talents like Boman Irani, Saurabh Shukla and Sanjay Dutt. Another flaw is that the first half involves too many songs which breaks the flow of the story and the second half tends to get preachy at times and the ending seemed to be a bit melodramatic just like 3 Idiots.Aamir Khan's PK is the heart and soul of this movie and he comes up with arguably one of his best performance of his career alongside his performances in Lagaan, Rang De Basanti, 3 Idiots etc. Expect him to win many best actor awards in this award season although he wouldn't be attending those award functions. Anushka Sharma plays a bubbly character and she is more than efficient in this role. Sanjay Dutt is wonderful in his brief screen role. Saurabh Shukla is watchable. Boman Irani is wasted in a role who has very little to do. The writing team of 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi, comes up with another socially relevant script and their work is top-notch although it isn't as water-tight as their previous work. The music by Shantanu Moitra is pretty good although the songs aren't as memorable as 3 Idiots. My picks are Bhagwan Kaha Hai Tu, Chaar Kadam and the PK theme.PK is not a movie which will please everyone. In fact, many will get offended due to its anti-religious views (A good example are the protests ranging in Gujarat accusing the movie of hurting Hindu sentiments). My advice to these people is not to misinterpret the message in the film. Just like the similar themed Paresh Rawal- starrer Oh My God, this movie is not telling us to stop having faith in God but it is questioning whether the medium by which we try to communicate with God is right or not. I recommend all of you to watch this movie at-least once. Whether you like it or not, you will not be able to erase this movie from your memory for a good time. And how many recent bollywood films linger in your memory even for a moment after you have finished watching it?",

There is Rajkumar Hirani style of making a movie commercially stable at the same time giving it an inspirational motive to change the society. The main idea of this movie was good though in some extent it coincides with the story of \"Oh My God\". Giving the story a Sci- Fi background was different but to me a practical background would have been much more appreciated. As a Rajkumar Hirani movie usually do, it attracts you to the story just at the beginning but this movie lacked this quality. As the story goes forward the vibe of a Hirani film came into picture. Thought the ending would be great as the story was constantly being better. But the ending was no better than the beginning. For the last 30 mins it was so hard for me to keep the concentration. I would say it was too much filmy. If we let some things slide the making was good. Liked the cinematography. Now the acting. Aamir Khan was good as expected. But Anushka Sharma looked as ugly as possible with her new horrible lip-job. So, it was a let down. Wish next movie of Rajkumar Hirani wont be like this.",

However with out his remote Control, which is essential for him to call his spaceship to pick him up, PK cannot leave earth. As his remote control was stolen straight after his arrival, he is desperate to get it back. Once he realizes that his chance are practically non existent to find his remote control, he choose to learn from the humans to seek help from god. But which one is the right one Hindu, Christian, Muslim or Sikhs god ? I found the idea to address human greed and religious hypocrisy very refreshing, however with the exception of Aamir Khan the acting was mostly abysmal throughout the movie.",

The same message was delivered again and again with the same format - PK locks his bulging idiot eyes on a stereotype from Indian culture, cue goofy music, PK approaches the person and causes a massive fuss by assessing his situation at face value without knowledge of cultural nuances. Human culture, especially religion, is full of ridiculous contradictions. I get it. For the 100th time, I get the joke, now please stop insulting my intelligence!Aside from that issue, the story was not structured properly; characters were heavily developed and then abandoned from the plot for far too long. The journey for PK to hunt for his remote was a mere vehicle to lead him through a comprehensive spreadsheet of the aforementioned stereotypes (it would not surprise me if the screenplay began life as this spreadsheet), and I was distinctly aware of that fact while watching.From a technical perspective every shot in the movie was done very well. The music scenes were amusing. Those are the only positives I can come up with.The movie's high position in the rankings comes from the vast majority of reviews, user and critic alike, originating from one demographic. It's not for me to say their taste is wrong, but they definitely were looking for something different in this movie than I was. I would warn viewers more accustomed to western culture and less with Bollywood to have a backup ready if you choose to spend your night watching this, because you might find it as disappointing as I did.",

The INFJ personality has the ability to see reality in layers which the other person can easily miss. Also as the character is portrayed to be of sensitive nature, he is also an HSP.

Amir again do a great acting and Anushka discovers a unique forms of expression which makes comedy scenes at outstanding level, in whole movie she also use variation of expressions to make scene more enjoyable Pk really teaches a lot of lesson for actors as well as for audience. Another best thing is that its song planning is amazing at first in starting when jaggu is at bicycle the background song describes about sharfaraj and in ending orders about Pk when she miss him that's really amazing and also movie starts by story which is about Pk, narrates by jaggu which also a sign of good film One of the best thing is that the look of Amir in movie is pure a comedian which makes movie more enjoyable and even Anushka she looks so cute before when she comes New Delhi at that time of first meeting with Pk after she uses her amazing expressions to give interest in scenes I really enjoyed this movie and I bet this is the best love story movie after titanic , Titanic lacks fun it's love story is amazing and hurting , But in Pk the whole picture is perfect , the love story of Pk is better than titanic and I want it's sequel to complete it's hurting love story both characters in ending has feeling related to each other jaggu understands Pk feelings while Pk not understands that jaggu had now know his feelings about her as well as she wants Pk to stop but Pk does not wants to break her loved life with sharfaraj\"He loved too much to let him go\" and that's story is ,its creates another sweet form of love \u2764. If jaggu really wants Pk back then its time for the sequel as she long loves him it makes sequel to bring him back in the story and in last scene when Pk comes to earth I think he must wants jaggu because he maintain its form which is loved by jaggu and that's it. I really want this movie to be nominated to Oscar. i'll give 9/10 as it is the best love story movie of Bollywood and even in the world",

It provokes your thoughts and makes you think about how the world works. The movie throws light on the fact that we are so biased about people from other religions, that we often mistake the good for the bad. The Film also guides people not to be superstitious. The movie is not an attack on any Religion, it is an attack on Mankind as it exists today. It highlights the wrongdoings by the so called godmen and makes an attempt to showcase them to the world. The points raised were good but could have hurt sentiments of some groups of people. Though there are some unpredictable scenes which make the audience uncomfortable. I won't recommend anyone to watch it with young children as some scene might affect them negatively. Overall it has a really good plot and fine performances from the star cast.",

The movie shows very nice scenario what human has done to humanity in the name sake of God. How people are using God to earn money and making fool of others.

            "content": "Well the opening of movie was good but the way movie progressed increased my disappointment progressively. The script was ordinary. The whole point of Anushka being in foreign land was to draw a conclusion at the end that one from a particular religious community can not be stereotyped as someone who always betrays. Come on, was that a necessary point to make and that too by comparing the whole belief (or should I say mis-belief??) of another community? Also, how do you fall in love with a person so quick (that too in just a song sequence) to take a decision of marriage. I know it can happen in Indian film, but in Star studded film?? :)Why a need of dancing car sequence?? To me it looked like very unnecessary just to get some attention. The probability of finding a dancing car is very less than probability of finding a Dhobi Ghat, it can also serve the same purpose. I am not a conservative person but when a movie is made with star actors then we need to understand that kids will also go with parents and watch movie. Another scene of co**m. 2-3 mins wasted in that pointless scene. You are comparing it with marriage celebration? That was also a unnecessary scene. The whole scene looked imposed with superficial smile from Boman and Anushka. And no consideration for kids watching this movie? (I am not sure how this movie is rated)Dialogues were fine at times with humor but overall the humor content was below average. MBMMBS was far far better. But the choice of another actor in last scene was good :) He looked like alien :)Music was below average. Lyrics could have been better. I would give 5 out of 10.",

It is actually good to have faith in GOD but doing business in the name of God is ridiculous.The fact is this business is increasing in India. People are donating more to temples rather than using that money on a better cause to improve our country.Don't get me wrong but there are many pandits and babas who are actually teaching us good lessons on God but the corrupt majority are making them look bad too.Also, people who are calling Aamir this and that should actually call the whole cast racist(if it is your opinion) including writer, director, producer... not alone aamir.I have a question in my mind that temples like Shirdi's Sai, Tirupati temple, Siddhivinayak, Golden temple etc get's a lot of chadhava from shardhaalu/donors. Where is that money going? Where is it spend? Definitely there should be accountability. Why don't they come forward when there is a natural disaster like it happened in Gujrat, Uttaranchal, J&K. Why don't they use that money for the welfare of the same society who raised that money in the name of God.Wake up people! Use your head when you're donating. Do it for a good cause and check it's authenticity. There is only a single positive energy, GOD! Why are we giving different names to a god who doesn't need it. And the funny thing is, people in our country are actually getting fooled by Human Being who call themselves God. Come on! Even the educated people! For instance, Sachin - God of Cricket. Seriously? Lord is acceptable but GOD? Why are you calling a human being god and insulting the almighty?When we try to raise our voice against such people, you are tortured mentally/physically till you stop. Democracy is suddenly vanished then.I could write on and on as the issues are endless in the name of religion and God.I loved the movie and the concerns it raised of the India as a whole.There were a bit flaws in the direction of the movie.

            "content": "No religions were harmed in the making of this film. That's the gist of a title card that runs before the credits in the Hindi movie \"PK,\" directed by Rajkumar Hirani, which states that the film doesn't intend to hurt the feelings of any community, sect or religion.And this sweet, ambling comedy about an innocent abroad - an alien who touches down in the Rajasthan desert - doesn't offend, even as it pokes gentle fun at religious differences and hypocrisy.When PK (Aamir Khan) lands in Rajasthan, naked and gym-buff, his first encounter with an earthling is a rude one. A man steals his flashing green pendant (it matches his flashing green eyes), a remote control that allows him to call his ship for pickup.After some twists and turns - including a quick, PK-less detour to Belgium for a Pakistani Romeo and Indian Juliet love story - our hero acquires language (Hindi) and finds himself in Delhi in search of his pendant. God alone, he's told, can help him.Guileless, he appeals to God in all his houses: temples, mosques, churches. Sneaking into a maternity ward, he examines an infant from top to bare bottom, looking for a label: is he Christian, Muslim, Hindu?Mr. Hirani's other films include \"Lage Raho Munna Bhai\" (2006), a comedy about a gangster who becomes a Gandhi-inspired good guy. That movie and its slogan, \"Gandhigiri,\" were so successful that they ushered in a small real-life wave of Gandhian protests.It's hard to imagine that \"PK,\" with its slogan \"wrong number\" (when God's interlocutors get their wires crossed), will have a similar impact. Mr. Hirani remains an excellent storyteller, weaving his disparate story strands into a convincing, satisfying whole - a rare Bollywood feat.But \"PK\" lacks the redemptive arc of \"Lage Raho\" - at least its hero does. PK, played with earnest sexlessness by Mr. Khan, who possesses one of Hindi cinema's most ogled bodies, is another man-boy innocent meant to remind us of our own corruption. He does, but so benignly, that it's hard to feel the sting.",

Might not be the most spontaneous and naturally gifted actors of Indian Cinema, but is definitely one of the finest actors Indian cinema has ever seen.Extremely hard working, passionate, has got a level head on his shoulders, a great risk taker and one of the best prodigies of Method acting. Has been daring to don different characters and tell us stories that are entertaining to say the least.Lovely movie and is yet another feather in Hirani's cap, although might not be the best from the Hirani stable.

Both have the magic on silver screen and is proved again recently released film \"PK\". The movie is not only bring the sensitive mattes but also creatively portrays the character \"PK\" which questions against the superstitions of religions. The most sensitive and bravery is it query in a country like India where religion is so insightful and deeply entrenched and \"PK\" has done wonderfully. In this film, \"PK\" (Aamir Khan) the title role, an alien dressed birthday suit who lands on earth and shakes the world with questioning on all fallacies of religion.The main role Aamir Khan \"PK\" came from another planet landing on earth and lost his remote and lose the opportunity to go back to his planet. After this he is trying to probe all the misconceptions of the society with the outsider eyes. He is not belong to this earth and Aamir Khan has portrayed the character so well with questioning on the religious superstitions and fallacies. There are different cultural and communication gaps we can find in \"PK\"'s character because coming from other planet who doesn't know any language but learn \"Bhojpuri\" by transferring from a girl with holding hand. \"Jaggu\" (Anushka Sharma) has teamed up with PK to help himto find the remote. Jaggu is a TV reporter who is also a victim of \"Tapashwee\" (Saurabh Shukla) who is a religious leader. Previously \"Jaggu\" had a relationship with a Muslim boy named \"Sarfaraz\" (Sushant Singh). She then broke up because of Tapashwee who convinced her that a Muslim always betrays with Hindu. Every time \"PK\" called \"its wrong number\" when anyone is doing any superstitions or fallacies. PK's another friend \"Bhairon\" (Sanjay Dutt) who initially helped him. While Jaggu is going to make a live TV show where she makes conversation between Tapashwee and PK. Bhairon caught the thief who steal PK's remote and sell it to Tapashwee. Tapashwee was lying to people that the remote he found from mountain and it's belong to their one God \"Shiva\". So Jaggu wants to unmask Tapshwee's character to the public. \"PK\" has asked some questions about God that why so many religions, why different beliefs, one god or many Gods and so on. Finally he concluded this our God is only one, he is so merciful and his existence everywhere. Wherever you are how you pray he can listen you, he is not liar. But we created a fraud and fake God which is bad like us, not kind even because we people are bad and our creation of God would be like us. After that PK got the remote from Tapashwee and went back to his planet and teach the society that believe in one and only God but don't create your own Gods. The last scene Aamir Khan's (\"PK\") is going back to the planet but he never express his love to Jaggu because he got to know Jaggu loves Sarfraz and so he just let her go and want to see her happy. Abhijaat Joshi and Rajkumar Hirani's script and dialogues are astonishing and I have found the audience most of the time laughing, clapping and while emotional scene came being so emotional and make people cry. The story is so exciting with huge performance especially by Aamir Khan. The supporting role Anushka, Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani and Sushant's performance also paint \"PK's canvas so well. The climax scene while Sarfraz and Jaggu was talking over phone on live show, Sushant's expression is marvelous and overall all the performers playing their job well. From the beginning to the ending Aamir Khan (PK) played so accurately and giving mind blowing expressions and to me it is his best work in his career. I don't forget this man every time breaks the Indian Bollywood Film's record and this time PK is successfully played in worldwide. PK movie has a huge success- 6.5 billion and US$100 million. PK received two Awards out of eight Nominations at the 60th Film fare Awards. The film won five Star Guild Awards, and two Life OK Screen Awards. It is not only the most all-time top blockbuster film in Bollywood but also the highest grossing foreign film in U.S.A. \"PK\" is a huge answer for the stereotyped people. \"PK\" frequently asks questions which can give us the formula that idol worship is necessary or not. The audience can realize the portrait of God. We cannot protect the God who creates everything. In \"PK\", the central character \"PK\" who is the alien and try to probe all issues which we are used to do this and without any reason we just believe what our religious leader says. \"PK\" is not only a film but also a social contributor. PK is a courageous film which is a good combination of Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani. PK is so successful because of Aamir Khan's magical presence and funny and sharp dialogues. I am giving 4 and half stars out of 5 stars. I recommend you to go for it. If you still not watching \"PK\" watch it now if you don't want to miss entertainment.

This is probably one of the most challenging characters that he has played so far and with his stellar performance, Aamir Khan carries the film all the way. His childlike innocence, his Bhojpuri accent and his love for 'paan' only adds layers to the character of PK. Anushka Sharma, who has in her previous releases earned quite a bit of critical acclaim, does a good job as Jagat \"Jaggu\" Janani. She stands shoulder to shoulder with Aamir through the entire film. Sushant Singh Rajput is impressive in an extended cameo. Saurabh Shukla, though good, seems to be underutilized along with Boman Irani who too could have been given a meatier part. Sanjay Dutt, on the other hand, manages to carry off his role as a Rajasthani man with panache.",

Brilliant movie with great messages for society. There are lot of powerful scenes, that will make LAUGH as well as CRY. The Screenplay is amazing and full/bunch of dialogue.

It has a great potential to change the people mind of how they would see the whole world.

I don't really understand what is the hype. Oh yeah, it is Aamir Khan! Somehow, all his movies are well hyped up before release.I have to admit, somehow, all the silliness is held together quite well by the director. But, it hits the peak of silliness when 2+ hours into the movie the good guy gets to lock horns with the bad guy on a live TV show. By then, I am squirming in my seat (fyi - there was no interval where I watched it).It must be made illegal to show this movie without an interval !!Coming to the question about god - Why do some people like this interesting? What is new there? Any sensible, logical person should by now has asked these questions over and over and settled on the answer. If we are still following an organized religion, it should only be for our own quantifiable benefit. We shouldn't need a silly Hindi movie to arouse that question in us. False godman has been the subject of Hindi movies for ages. Somehow, they are still in business. Hence, that aspect of this movie is insignificant.Many of the comedy scenes are silly at their best. The much talked about scene where PK pulls the pj out of a fat man's butt is completely lame. It is a joke that has been told and heard so many times on too many platforms. It is really cheap of Hirani to steal it and hype it up so much.What else? A pan-chewing, wide-open eyed, stiff alien? Usually a good actor's role is to efficiently switch between emotions on his/her face, but in this movie, Aamir Khan's hard work is to maintain the stiff expression on his face and to deliver the dialogs in the Bhojpuri accent. He can't be credited for good acting. He definitely needs to be credited for not straying into over-acting. But, at several places, it is very clear that the frame changes abruptly when he starts to slip into over-acting. So, the director or the editor should get that credit.Others - Anushka Sharma has acted OK. Her role doesn't have any major challenges. Sanjay Dutt too - OK. No major role, but he has carried himself quite well despite the paunch that the makeup man hasn't even tried very hard to hide. Review summary - Skip the theater, wait for the DVD and watch in parts.",

Enjoy.I am not opposed to the idea of cinematic liberties. But really the question is, how far can you stretch that idea.You don't go promote the movie on television, as it costs time and money. Instead you add some scenes in the movie which will create controversy and keep the movie in the limelight for a few days, which is all you need these days. Release the film on 5000-6000 screens simultaneously. Cast one of the superstars in your movie, to draw the audiences.You may have noticed that I haven't commented anything on the actual movie so far. Thats exactly the point ! These movies, be it PK or HNY or Kick or Bang Bang, have nothing to do with the actual content of the movie. Story, Screenplay, Acting, Direction, nothing matters. All these movies are sold just on one thing, HYPE.Thats how you end up with a movie like PK. Its not their audacity, its just plain belief in the audience's dumb and numb state of mind, being subjected to mediocrity all year long. Even a pretentious, clich\u00e9d, mindless, sappy piece of creation is lapped up and hailed as a masterpiece.I can compile a huge list of things that are amiss in this movie. But really, its not worth the time. And it wont make any difference now. And in any case, one can argue that this movie worked for them in spite of the loopholes. So be it. If it worked at all for someone, at whatever level, its good for them. It sucked big time, as far as I am concerned.There is a full scene devoted to the ENLIGHTENMENT of the JANTA regarding the condom ISSUE. Its pitiful that a director like Rajkumar Hirani changed tracks so shamelessly, from dealing with real issues in a real(almost) way, to this type of cheap and crude humor. One can argue that even 3 idiots had crude jokes. But there are two problems with that argument. Firstly, 3 idiots was about college students and hostel life. and secondly, in addition to the crude jokes, the film had a well written script, where every single scene, character and development was strung together perfectly. Seamlessly.PK is an ill conceived, shabbily made, overrated movie. RIP Raju Hirani the genius director. Welcome Rajkumar Hirani the money spinner - warm welcome from Farah Khan and Rohit Shetty.",

The beautiful visuals are complemented by a soulful soundtrack. Anushka Sharma delivers a captivating performance as the female lead. Aamir Khan is an absolute joy to watch and makes one wish that if aliens did decide to come visiting, they should definitely be like 'PK'. Sushant Singh Rajput shows pure brilliance in the short scenes he is a part of.

This I watched, mainly because i had a week off, and there was nothing else to do, so when a friend rang and said 'we are going to watch PK, do you want to come' we all went.PK (like ET) wants to go home. For an alien, he is remarkably like a human with autistic spectrum behavioural disorder. He observes the absurdities of god and god related activities that abound in India, and is appropriately confused. This is exactly the response of any independent observer, but the only way the film makers could represent this point of view was by using the device of an autistic alien. If a normal human character had said the stuff he did, it would have been deemed too unbelievable (because apparently normal people can't think like that in India!). I like Amir Kahn's movies (Peepli live, Chalo Dilli, absolutely loved Delhi Belly) and I understand there is a fine line he has to tread, if he wants to make a movie like this, and keep his head attached to his neck. But the biggest disappointment for me was the pulled punch in the studio scene. The logical conclusion of PK's observations would be that there is no god, not that there are 2 sets of gods. This is a missed opportunity to put across the rationalist view point, that gods are us, as are demons. That would have made this a great movie for me. As it stands, its a bit 'meh'. 6/10, and that is being generous, on account of Anoushka's legs.",

As in the case with the movie 'Munna Bhai MBBS', I watched it out repeatedly without having this effect of boredom. Somehow or the other, a new & novel idea floated with wit, comedy & irony to black-paint the character of religious personnel involved in grabbing & looting the innocent people in the name of God.

So far, Pk has extremely well written reviews and ratings and is having a number of increase of views everyday. Well, why should you watch this movie? I strongly recommend you to watch this movie because it shows the best moral of religions, the true meaning of religion. Not only that, it shows how love can solve many situations and how much religion is deceiving people's mindsets and people from their mindsets. Did you ever think why religions are made? If yes, then this is the perfect movie for you to watch and get the answer to your question. Pk is similar to the movie \"OMG,\" which was released in 2012. Both of the films show the reason to believe in God. Both movies are not made to discriminate or insult and make fun of a religion. The movies do not mean to harm the religion at ALL. The real reason the movies are made is to teach people about what religion is, to remind people what their religion is, to tell them what there religion is, to tell them why there are religions and cultures and traditions that are very different form each other. These movie hold special lessons to be learned and to be taught. So, I heartily and greatly recommend people who haven't watched the movie to do so.

            "content": "OK so I had hopes watching this one. Finally got a chance to watch this. I will be honest, its a brave move to try and fit all these different things inside a 3 hours span. Different things being the varied set of emotions that make you feel happy, sad, sentimental, all in just one movie. Raju Hirani did this with 3 Idiots and he did it flawlessly. That movie was a perfect blend of all emotions and worked incredibly well in terms of entertainment and the message being passed.Unfortunately, PK is a good attempt that falls flat trying that. You have a complicated story arch of Aamir's character and how he realizes things that he does and the social message he wants to pass. With all this you now have Anushka's story arch which starts off good but suddenly is given a full stop, only to conveniently resume when the movie requires it later. I strongly think that movies like 3 Idiots and 'especially' Oh My God far surpass PK because they were successful in delivering the message they aim for. The topic picked by PK, the commercialization of religions and how one should follow true religion is way way more clear and effective in OMG. The good thing I loved about this movie though is the way Aamir's character learns the different religious rituals performed all over India by different religious sects. The way his character is written is pretty unique just the way his character was in 3 Idiots. The twist by the end is good as well but I sincerely think either Anushka's love story should have been completely dropped or should have been given more screen time.In the end, the movie tries to be a jack of all trades but fails a wee bit. Not as mesmerizing as OMG but its a worth watching movie for sure. And since the way Aamir explains how religions are being followed wrongly is more down to earth and in simpler language, I think it will be understood well by the rural parts of India as well, which is where this problem lies anyways.

Rajkumar Hirani repeats his success again by telling an engaging story with a message.The movie deals with the topic of religious practices irrationally carried out and Godmen.
