            "content": "It's no secret that, on both the mainstream and independent circuit of film, Christian cinema has been a big focus in 2014. Films like \"Heaven is for Real,\" \"Noah,\" \"Son of God,\" and next month's \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\" have all catered to the faithful in some way and have gone on to achieve uniformly strong financial numbers as well. The independent circuit has seen big hits like \"God's Not Dead\" and marginal successes like \"Left Behind,\" \"Mom's Night Out,\" \"Persecuted,\" and \"When the Game Stands Tall,\" all of which finding ways to connect with their target audience in at least recognizing their faith in the cinema, a place where it's fair to believe the religious demographic has felt ignored. Former Television star and devout, outspoken Christian Kirk Cameron has now thrown his hat in the ring, latching on to this newfound trend, and effectively making not only the worst film of its genre but the worst film of 2014. \"Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas\" is a disjointed mess, structurally pathetic and morally bankrupt as we watch scenes interwoven with little coherency, dialog written and delivered in its most wooden form, and wonderful morals to teach our children, like \"materialism is good.\" The film begins with Cameron sitting in a blatantly artificial living room, decorated with more Christmas lights and flair than Macy's after Thanksgiving passes, giving us an introduction to the film at hand. He states the biggest problem with the Christmas season is the \"people\" who want to segregate the spread of faith and good cheer to the private homes of those who celebrate the holiday or simply want the holiday done away with all together. He rambles on for about three minutes as the introduction sets the perfect theme for this film; it's a circumventing project that never results in a specific or thoughtfully-articulated point.We cut to a Christmas party held by Cameron's sister, where a Santa has been hired, the tree has been erected, the house has been decorated, a feast has been prepared, and everyone is in an incorruptibly cheery mood; everyone except Cameron's brother-in-law Christian (director Darren Doane), who is seen moping around the house before quietly slipping away to his car. Kirk follows Christian and learns the materialism of Christmas bothers him immensely, as he watches kids beg for toys they won't play with in three weeks and parents max out their credit cards, giving way to the materials and the illuminating tree in the center of the room, and all while neglecting the baby Jesus in the manger, who is the ultimate \"reason for the season.\"Cameron begins to initiate flashbacks to biblical times to \"justify\" why we have the Christmas traditions that we do. However, it's not enough that we get a history lesson told from the enormously biased lens of Cameron, but in a dodgy and muddled manner. Cameron gets absorbed in the significance of baby Jesus's swaddling cloth and the original mean-spirited roots of Saint Nicholas (something that will undoubtedly scare and confuse children), never addressing Christian's true distaste for the holiday season. Kirk meanders for about forty minutes, talking himself in incoherent and redundant circles, never addressing Christian's questions in a way that we can extract counterpoints or citing Christmas's Pagan and cultist roots (if you're going to show Saint Nicholas as a brute, at least address the backstory).Interjected in these ridiculously dry biblical flashbacks and in-car dialogs are exaggerated characters masquerading as likable people with personalities drawn so wide they are desperately unfunny. We see two party guests discuss \"The War on Christmas,\" relating it to several other conspiracy theories that just feels like a soundoff of paranoia. We get a few minutes of dead-end, annoying conversation and some of the worst displays of acting this year before it's back to the car for a half-assed lecture. \"Saving Christmas\" ends with an abhorrent dance number to an incorrigible techno/rap hybrid, with members of the cast obnoxiously dancing and doing slow-motion choreography together. We end things with a perfunctory voice-over with Cameron before we're greeted by almost ten minutes of closing credits showing bloopers, outtakes, and a barrage of other things padding this project to just barely being feature- length (eighty minutes). If my plot synopsis sounds like it has not made any sense, then I have effectively lived up to the structure and the narrative pace of this particular film.Just by comparing the full-length film to its trailer, you can tell \"Saving Christmas\" was Cameron's last minute idea to cash in on the Christian cinema craze of the year. The trailer for the film talks about how Christmas has been corrupted by materialism and the political correctness of the holiday. However, Cameron blatantly contradicts his thesis when he states during the closing monologue that \"materialism is good\" because Christmas is about \"God taking possession of a material body.\" Aside from ushering in a pathetic excuse for a moral at the end of a film about Christmas, the cardinal sins committed here run amuck: a sloppy narrative hodgepodge of biblical flashbacks, inept lecturing, and pointless filler clearly padding a small runtime, atrocious acting on all fronts, a desperate attempt at \"staying hip\" and keeping the attention of the audience by throwing in a hip-hop dance number, contemptible morals, and failure to address or even stick to a cogent thesis. Kirk Cameron and company should be required to volunteer at local charities or help cater several breakfasts with Santa to make up for such a yuletide atrocity.",

Christians and non-Christians alike will most likely find it tedious--like a lecture by a boring professor that goes on and on and on and on. It lacks the structure or style to make it interesting or even a movie. Instead, it mostly consists of Kirk Cameron lecturing and lecturing and lecturing and who wants to go to see a film or pay for a DVD like this?! On top of that, so much of the film was just badly made...such as the insufferable opening song, the illogical 'truths' in the film (such as the myth about swadling clothes and how they are the same as burial cloths--which they AREN'T), the poor acting and overall dullness of the movie. This film isn't even bad in a fun way like BIRDEMIC or THE ROOM or PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Instead, it's just ponderous and preachy-- things no one wants from a movie.

            "review_title": "Every bit as bad as its reputation says",
            "content": "This movie is so, so utterly wretched, not only in its execution but also in its conception.Just from a filmmaking perspective, it's extremely shoddy. Many portions look like home movies. A large part of the film is Cameron sitting in a car talking to a friend, and that's not interesting to watch. \"Comedy\" scenes have nothing to do with the rest of the story, and are creepily unfunny. A bizarre dance scene at the end is out of place and seems inserted to extend the time. Cameron's presence here is smarmy and smug; he lays out his spiritual views and his friend just gushes about how right Cameron is and how he's helped him see the light and love Christmas and all that. A bigger problem is the misinformation that Cameron spews so authoritatively, some of which runs counter to the Bible and to known history. To give a partial list:Cameron claims that Joseph and Mary were hiding from soldiers sent by Herod to kill all babies being born. But the Gospel of Matthew says the soldiers were sent by Herod AFTER Jesus was born, when Herod was tipped off by the visiting Wise Men that a King of the Jews had been born. Joseph and Mary then took Jesus and did the Flight into Egypt to save the child's life.Cameron insists the Nativity took place in a cave because the manger was made of stone. No source claims the manger was stone, or that the Nativity took place in a cave. Matthew says it was in Joseph's house in Bethlehem, Luke says it was a stable. This seems like a post-hoc attempt to link the Nativity with the Resurrection.Cameron says frankincense and myrrh were \"funeral spices.\" Although myrrh had been used in Egyptian mummification, frankincense was not, and both were much more commonly used as a sacred incense in Hebrew temples.He goes into detail about Saint Nicholas' life, presenting it as fact, but in truth very little is known for sure about him, and some Christian leaders openly suggest that he may never have existed. All that is known for sure is that someone named Nicholas was at one point the Bishop of Myra; everything else is unsure and in the territory of legend and myth.Legend has it that during the Council of Nicaea, Nicholas angrily struck Arius in the face for saying that Jesus and God were separate. Cameron depicts Nicholas savagely and brutally attacking Arius and beating him with a shepherd's crook, a scene many Christians found objectionable.Cameron depicts the historical Saint Nicholas climbing on a sleigh to deliver presents to children, something he never did in any legend. He also claims that Saint Nicholas is the gift-giver everywhere, also not supported by history. Some areas give gifts on Christmas, others at Epiphany, others on St. Nicholas' day, and in some areas the gifts are delivered by someone else entirely, such as La Befana in Italy, St. Basil in Greece, the Yule Lads in Iceland, St. Lucy in Croatia, and multiple countries have the gifts delivered by the Magi, angels, or the Christ Child himself. Cameron says Nicholas was \"sainted,\" when in reality Nicholas was never canonized. His sainthood was more by word-of-mouth.Cameron makes an elaborate rationalization for Christmas trees relating to the crucifixion and to the Garden of Eden; this connection is very convoluted and labored, and doesn't hold water. And he doesn't address the parts of Jeremiah which some feel are a commandment against Christmas trees.He claims that gifts piled under the Christmas tree are perfectly acceptable as they are reminiscent of the skyline of Jerusalem. By that reasoning, they could also be the skyline of Babylon or Rome, and could represent oppression and slavery. It's a poorly considered analogy that should never have been included.I'm sure I'm missing other bits, but I'm not inclined to go back and watch it again. It's unsettling to see Cameron stand and claim that it's OK to be materialistic at Christmas, because that's when God came to the Earth in material form. (That's pretty much a direct quote.) Never mind the many passages where the Bible tells us to set aside worldly things and not be materialistic! He exhorts viewers to eat themselves to bursting and buy the biggest ham and the richest butter....but isn't gluttony considered a deadly sin?At no point does he address such issues as helping the poor, feeding the hungry, giving to charity, volunteering, or anything. One is left with the impression that one should only think of one's self and one's immediate family and friends. Does Cameron remember Jesus' command to his followers to give away all they had to the poor? Somehow, I don't think so.Cameron gives the impression of someone who read parts of the Bible long ago, but rather than fit his life to the Bible, he is fitting the Bible to the life he wants to lead, and making one justification after another without ever bothering to double-check if he's remembering it correctly, or if there's something in the Bible that disagrees with him. It's clear he considers himself a better Christian than you. Many of the faithful have been turned off by this movie, some even going so far as to declare it blasphemous and call Cameron a false prophet. I'm not so sure I would agree, but at the same time, this movie does have some value of showing how even a faithful Christian can fall victim to the sins of pride and arrogance. It's clear that Cameron's ego was in overdrive, and this movie is not as much a testament to God as it is an expression of Cameron's arrogance.",

I heard about Kirk Cameron's up voting campaign on Rotten Tomatoes and the ensuing backlash from atheists and so on. But I wanted to see if the film was really that bad. It is. It's really awful, probably the most awkward, uncomfortable hour of my life. Troll 2 was funny on a So-bad-it's-good level, so was The Room. But this is just painfully bad. This film aggravates me on so many levels. But I want to leave out the B.S religious side of it, there's more than enough reviews, even from Christians, attacking this film for it's head scratching Evangelical nonsense. Instead, I'd like to focus on an aspect of the film that I feel has been overlooked, the historical \"facts\" that Cameron pulls out of his arse. I'm a history buff, and this film made me so angry. Cameron expects us to believe that St. Nicholas got so angry with Arius that he dragged him out into the snow and beat the crap out of him with a staff! He did no such thing. As one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed, St. Nicholas got into an argument concerning the divinity of Christ and punched the Christian presbyter in the face. Then there's the barking mad argument about the pagan roots of Christianity which Cameron dismisses, claiming that everything was created by God and therefore everything to do with Christmas can be traced back to God, even the Nutcracker! And on it goes... The arguments make no sense, the acting is horribly stilted and the 'comedy' is painfully bad. It's such an incoherent, rambling mess from \"Crocoduck\" Cameron that by the time he's dancing and doing the worm, you just have no idea what you're watching any more.

            "content": "Every Christmas season one can count on the fact that we will be inundated with TV shows recycling the It's A Wonderful Life story, Hallmark Channel will overwhelm us with treacle, and a spate of Christmas-themed films will multiply at the cineplex to raise holiday spirits. I give extremist Christian Kirk Cameron dubious credit for crafting a Christmas-themed film that actually seems to be completely clueless about the meaning of Christmas.It goes without saying that the film resembles a glorified home movie, with horrible writing, worse acting and horrendous production values. Most of the film functions as little more than an unwieldy frame for Cameron to lecture at the audience using the most spurious of \"facts\" and a dubious re-writing of history.The basic \"story\" opens at a family Christmas party where Kirk's brother-in-law, Christian (oh the irony!) is all rather overwhelmed and depressed by the materialism of the holiday and feels that the true meaning of Christmas has been lost. This \"attitude\" apparently irritates everyone else, and so Kirk follows Christian to his car to harangue him on his misguided foolishness for the extraordinarily padded 80 minutes running time. Most of this has the camera focused on Cameron's perpetually smug smirk while he relentlessly lectures his hapless brother-in-law with outright lies, heavily abridged stories, and general all-around shaming. Interspersed to pad the running time, we take some brief breaks back into the house where completely ridiculous one-note flamboyant caricatures indulge in laughable conversations that no one you know not in a padded cell will ever have with you in your lifetime. The pathetic point though is that during Cameron's often incoherent and misleading ramblings, he never once truly addresses any of the issues that Christian had about the materialism of the modern celebrations. Nevertheless, Kirk's relentless verbal diarrhea utterly astounds Christian and makes him \"see the light\" and he returns to the party to beg the forgiveness of everyone there for negatively impacting their celebration.Then, Kirk launches into yet another lecture where he urges us to buy the biggest tree, get the richest butter, and max out the credit cards because this is all a part of Christmas and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I myself was raised a Christian and I can assure you that if anyone were to parrot this thought back to any of my religion teachers, their mouth would be washed out with soap. It is a perfectly despicable moral and abysmal coda to an already dreadful \"holiday\" film, which does the unthinkable of surpassing Christmas with the Kranks and Jingle All the Way as the most morally jaded holiday film in history. The film also includes a relentless unfunny blooper reel AND a dance sequence that must be seen to be believed...or better yet don't see it at all.",

            "content": "First, let me state that in spite of the claims of Cameron and those who support him (and who have attempted to artificially raise this movie's ratings with fake profiles and fake reviews), I, as someone who hated this movie, have nothing against Christians or Christianity. Not at all. Most everyone I know and love _are_ Christians. Die-hard, conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Fox-news-loving fundamentalist Christians. And even THEY thought this movie sucked.That Kirk tried to use religious guilt on people to have the ratings artificially inflated is just pathetic. Seriously, dude, you have a problem. You need help. Get some. :-/ My opinion of this movie is pretty much the same as the opinions of EVERYONE I know who's actually had the misfortune of deciding to give it a try. It would be pure camp if those who made it weren't being so stone-faced serious. It's patronizing, condescending, childish and just downright _bad_. And it's not the message, itself - even those I know who agree with the central point Kirk's trying to make see the movie as doing more harm than good.As for that illicit ratings-inflating campaign, it appears to be bearing fruit. When you have a movie with overwhelmingly bad ratings (and I man REALLY bad, where most are just 1-star with, shall we say, \"Nothing nice to say...\"), and just a couple of profiles with 10-star ratings and glowing things to say, and ALL of those 10-star profiles were clearly just set up just to make the glowing review about just that one movie... I'm not going to outright accuse anyone of anything, but, well, it doesn't inspire confidence in their legitimacy.I mean seriously, dude, stop it. You're not helping Christianity's image at all. In fact, you're making it worse. Even if you don't care about your own image, you should seriously give thought to how much more damage you want to do to the Christian image in the U.S. today. Or are you a closet atheist trying to destroy the \"enemy\" from within? Your actions are hurting far more than helping.And I have nothing against Christianity or religion in general. If people want to be proud of their religion and remind themselves of the spin Christianity has added to the meaning of all these previously-existing traditions and holidays, that's wonderful.

            "content": "I have to admit, that I hadn't even planed to go to the movies on the day that I walked into \"Saving Christmas\". There was nothing on offer that interested me, so I turned to figure another way to squander my money. But then I saw the name \"Kirk Cameron\", saw that pasty face on the poster and two words came to my mind: \"Crockoduck\" and \"Banana\"! Yes, through the internet-memes and jokes I had been exposed to Cameron and his ilk. Upon realizing that those people were not comedians, I figured this was the most hilarious insane stuff I had heard in a long time and that Kirk Cameron may well be the missing brother of \"Dumb and Dumber\". So I flashed the buck, walked in and expected much unintentional hilarity and future memes in the making.There were about 10 to 15 people sitting in the cinema, most with kids (I presume they were expecting a Christmas comedy). For a good deal of the beginning we are exposed to Cameron brattling on about some things or other, but it was mainly boring, nonsensical stuff that contained no (unintentional) comedy gold. Only when Kirk spouts that \"god created winter solstice\", there was some chuckling to be heard. Not bad, but heard before (what hasn't god created allegedly? Cars, air, shoes, bacteria, the universe and everything else, etc \u2013 this answer will give you a guaranteed A+ in any bible- or koran-school). At this point Cameron is sitting in some car with another guy and, like a true believer he keeps rambling and rambling and rambling. Nodded off for awhile but since I have a light sleep and get easily awoken by noise, I can only deduct that there was no joke missed since nobody had been laughing so far. At what I presume must have been the end of the \"movie\" there was some ridiculous dance-sequence (you know the type that should signify to the audience that they're watching a 'hip' film) and I decided to call it a day. As I turned to leave, I noticed that the cinema was empty and that I was the last rat to leave the sinking ship. So I left Kirk and his friends to dance to an empty cinema \u2013 and for all I know, they still dance there as I write.Look, we are all aware that people will believe much if only it gives them a crutch for reality. Virgins giving birth, horses flying from Mekka to Jerusalem overnight, zombies rising from the grave in order to bring world-peace, etc. It would be pointless (and perhaps even unkind) to point out that virgins cannot give birth, horses don't fly and that the dead stay dead. But that's were magic and science clash, alchemy has to make way or chemistry and believe hollers at common-sense and knowledge. Nothing new there, it's been going on since the stone-age. But the stuff that Cameron and his ilk have formulated here (to put it kindly), that's a whole new dimension of crazy. It reeks not only of fanatics but of self-serving. And the worst sin: this movie is boring, tedious and free of laughs, no matter which way you slice it.The lesson learned: it can be mildly amusing to watch a five minute YouTube video about a deranged guy, but giving him 80 minutes of your live, that's simply not a good idea. It's like holding a 'deep' conversation with a bunch of jehova's witness or the guy on the corner with the \"the end is nigh\"-sign \u2013 what's the point if no real laughs are to be had? Just wait for the internet-meme; if there's something worth laughing about, the \"haters\" will find and post if for sure (and it's free!). \"Jesus Camp\" was funnier (and \"Jesus Camp\" was actually a very sad movie). This here is \"IMDB Bottom-100\"-material.Now, enough electronic ink wasted on this. Let's make space for those who found the movie \"exceptional\", \"inspirational\" and \"great education\" \u2013 you might be able to guess from which corner those come.What I give this tripe? Of course nothing. If you see a one point rating, it probably comes from god (pardon, meant to say IMDb)",

I happen to subscribe to the view that the \"war on Christmas\" is part of a larger, not necessarily connected, movement whose chief side effect is to eliminate or diminish the chief underpinnings and foundations of western Judeo-Christian society. Lawsuits against Nativity displays are, to me, the handiwork of unhappy zealots. Having said all that, this film was earnest but profoundly flawed.First, I didn't appreciate the swipe against the Catholic Church's hierarchy (bishops with high hats and scepters) during the St. Nicholas segment. I do like the St. Nicholas story, but it was contrived here with the original St. Nicholas doing a \"ho-ho-ho\" (I am not kidding) just before being told by his assistant to start the deliveries (presumably of gifts).Second, if indeed the simplicity of the original Nativity is to be stressed, with Jesus born to Mary and Joseph in a cave, laid in a feeding manger, then perhaps they should have cast a Mary who had not just had her nails done. There they were, as Mary was holding the Christ child, each nail impeccable - and painted. And their garments? Perfectly clean, even looking like they'd just been ironed. Third, don't direct so that we can see the direction. Head turns, puzzled looks, earnest looks . . . I shouldn't be hearing in my head the director's exact stage directions. \"OK, look right at him then turn away.\" Fourth, this was not about Saving Christmas.

Apparently one of the parents insisted we see a documentary about making Christmas more about Jesus and less about commercialism.Well the jokes on them because shockingly this movie is all about justifying the commercialism of Christmas.I was seriously not expecting that. THis movie throws so much BS at you that it's pretty worrying. It's also really funny. I think I was the only person who enjoyed this movie. I was hoping that Kirk would have a seeing where he's just says insane things like his infamous interview on evolution.This whole movie is insane. I don't think anyone was expecting it to be like this with the random dance scenes, the stereotyped black guy, the stereotypical atheist, and everything else.And now here is an example of Cameron's crazy points about Christmas: -The Christmas tree is not Pagen, it is because Adam and Eve stole from the tree of knowledge and to make up for the original sin, Jesus returned the fruit which was part of man by hanging himself on a cross, which is made of wood which naturally comes from a tree. So trees are really crosses and the Christmas tree is a cross.I did not make that up, that is seriously an argument he makes.And the whole movie is so insane that you have to see it to believe it. I don't think this movie will harm society because I think most Christians who make a big deal about the \"War on Christmas\" will be horrified by this and those who actually buy into it were probably lost causes.

And worst of all, he even attempts to justify his materialism -- his greed and narcissism -- by claiming that's the good proper Christian thing to do.So if not from rabid consumerism, what is Kirk Cameron trying to save Christmas from? From people celebrating, or even acknowledging the existence of, other holidays besides Christmas, from non-Christians celebrating Christmas, and from Christians celebrating Christmas any other way than the way Kirk Cameron believes you should.In short, this is eighty minutes of Kirk Cameron trying to cram one hundred pounds of his self-absorbed discount-salvation bull**** into a one-pound bag, slap \"Christmas Spirit\" on it with a label maker, and hopelessly attempt to cram it down your throat.Unless you are a raving fascist fundamentalist who only hasn't watched this movie because you are afraid of what will happen if you turn your 24/7 Fox News feed off, this movie is guaranteed to make you very angry.

The film is not available in my country, but the full film can be found online for anyone to see just in case anybody is wondering how it came to be watched by me.Finally seeing 'Saving Christmas', it turned out it not only really is that terrible but is one of my most regretted film viewings. One where a very early bailing was strongly considered but generously stuck with it in order to be fair, never judge films without seeing the whole thing (wish that more people did that instead of bragging about walking out after twenty minutes or something similarly ridiculous). It is by far the worst film of 2014, an easy contender for the worst of the decade and is bottom 5 material.And Kirk Cameron's immature and condescending defence of 'Saving Christmas' and attacking those who hated it (note to Mr Cameron, you don't have to be an atheist or even religious to find 'Saving Christmas' a terrible film, speaking as someone who is neither but with not a biased against Christians bone in my body) is a perfect example of what is wrong with how people express their opinions on film, critics and film watchers today. People who have an inability to tell the difference between fact and opinion, resort to the \"I'm right and you're wrong\" clich\u00e9 and have to insult others, bash critics and invent ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories.Back to talking about 'Saving Christmas', the whole thing is hopelessly inept. It feels very slapped together with no rhyme or coherence, with amateurishly designed, written and acted biblical flashbacks, a lot of padding with scenes that go on forever (got tired of the scenes in the car fast, which saw lots of forced at best acting and gobbledegook that passes for dialogue), lots of repetition (like with the hot chocolate and the car conversations) and others having no reason for being there and Cameron's dubious generalisations (refuse to call them facts) and narration that come over as preachy, biased, self-absorbed sermonising standing out as especially bad. Oh and that ending dance sequence was an abomination in every sense, pacing, choreography, music, everything.It even looks bad, with some of the most artificial production values one will find anywhere let alone a film, complete with pedestrian photography and disjointed editing. The music was instantly forgettable as soon as the film was finally over and as for the direction, what direction? There is no coherence to the whole thing, the pacing is all over the place (interminably dull mostly) and there has never been more non-existent direction of actors, even on films riffed on MST3K.Writing is appalling from heavy-handed, egotistical start to abominable finish. That for Cameron has already been discussed but there is nothing heart-warming, funny or insightful about 'Saving Christmas', nothing that makes one think hard or feel anything. For a festive occasion, one couldn't imagine and will never see again a more drearily portrayed Christmas, this actually felt like it was made by people who hated Christmas even more than Ebeneezer Scrooge did. One is just bored out of their mind and angry at their life being wasted on a film that has no engagement, is so poorly put together and made, is impossible to learn anything from or get emotionally invested in and talks at them. Am not easily preached at, but 'Saving Christmas' talked at and down to me.Cameron's \"acting\" is extremely forced and patronising, pretty much like mugging, throughout and his huge ego bursts alive just as much on screen, in his material and how he delivered it, as it did when he attacked those who panned the film for far more legitimate reasons than he and the very small minority agreeing with him can ever give for finding any kind of value in the film. To me he is hypocritical as well as egotistical, due to that it is Christians that are more likely than anybody else to feel patronised to the most. The other cast members are not worth mentioning, don't even remember many, that's how much Cameron and his ego dominates.Overall, one of, and one of the biggest examples of, not many irredeemably awful films out there. Unless watching for curiosity's sake, this is a must avoid. 0/10 (an unheard of rating for me these days, have grown to hate giving them out, but 'Saving Christmas' is in the top 10 of the most deserving recipients of it).

From beginning to end, it plays like one of those late night infomercials where the host is far to excited to be human. This film is nothing but a vanity vehicle for Kirk Cameron, it's self congratulatory and he comes off like a 12 year old locked in a toy store over night. His performance is a wreck, his exaggerated enthusiasm is cringe-worthy and at any minute you expect him to giggle and shout \"Hey Ma! I'm making my own movie.\" This is less a movie about Christmas, Jesus, or anything else as much as it is about Kirk Cameron begging you to look at him as he twirls.",

Even though the actual footage is less than 70 minutes \u2013 yet feels like 4 hours \u2013 it's more like a 5 minute Sunday School video padded with an incredible amount of slo-mo, a hilariously bad dance sequence, extended hot chocolate promotions and yawn-inducing end-credit goofs to attempt to qualify as a feature film. And though Kirk Cameron's Ego movies are best watched with plenty of alcohol, a drinking game can be created here with the vast number of slowed down shots, Kirk's sister staring off in disbelief, mentions of hot chocolate as if it was a hot lover and actors looking directly at the camera. I guess there's that as a positive.Basically, Kirk Cameron's Ego gets everyone to pitch in a couple of bucks to film in two main locations and attempt to debunk, I guess, a couple of people's anger that Christmas is anything but a reminder of Christ's birthday. A scary lady's husband is being a sourpuss when everyone isn't just shouting \"Jesus is Lord!\" and instead, brutally handing out gifts for Christmas. It takes Kirk Cameron's Ego to give him a laughing bible lesson in a vehicle to bring him back to sliding on floors and scaring people.While this \"movie\" feels like it cost less than twenty bucks to make, it's an extremely simple church lesson that couldn't been summed up tightly in a 5-minute YouTube video. My guess is that Kirk Cameron's Ego wanted to make more money by releasing it into theatres last year. I'll save you the horrifying experience here by paraphrasing what Kirk Cameron's Ego said \u2013 and this is one spoiler you won't mind since it will save you these 80 minutes you would've regretted: \"Because it's in the bible in various and random spots: put up a Christmas tree with fruit on it and presents underneath, Santa's okay to visit, Christ rested on a rock with a cloth He won't see again for 33 years and drink plenty of hot chocolate.\"Damn, I hope I didn't miss anything.

            "content": "Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike this movie directed and written by Darren Doane, as much as other critics seem to hate it. I honestly found the endless amounts of dialogue with host Kirk Cameron, somewhat entertaining due to how bat-crazy, his arguments were. Some of it, seem very interesting, like how the film try hard to bridge Christmas tree with that of worshipping Jesus Christ on the cross due to the fact, that they were both made, from wood that came from God. However, that argument isn't that strong as the film makes it out to be, due to the fact, that Cameron seem a bit confused with the biblical tree, he is saying about. After all, the Tree of Life is way different than the Tree of Knowledge. Anyways, most of all of the theories that Cameron was talking about the origins of Christmas were like that. It was bit too strawman and badly research to be taken serious. I really didn't like how Kirk Cameron was trying to convince us that various popular elements of Christmas are more biblical in origin, when it was clearly not. For example, worshipping trees, had its roots in ancient Mesopotamia time, way before, any of the Abrahamic Judaism religions were created. A few of the examples, he brought up, seem a bit unfocused as well. I really don't get, how putting gifts under a tree, is relate to the biblical idea of making New Jerusalem, into a reality. It really doesn't make a lick of sense. Another problem with how this film is how it was market. The poster and trailers imply that the film might be a fun Christmas comedy; like something out of 1989's Christmas Vacation or 1996's Jingle of the Way for Christian families; but in fact, it's an interminable, highly dark and fear-mongering lecture of the bible, masquerading as a jolly good time. Talks about babies and heretic killings, really makes this a bit, too uncomfortable for families to watch. Another problem with the marketing is how the film's trailer acts like it's about stripping away greed from the holiday season and putting Christ back into Christmas. In actuality, the film actively embraces materialism to the point, that it seem to be less about Jesus Christ, and more about defending selfish greedy habits that the holidays season has carry on. I really don't get it, how can this film defend, being selfish and as materialistic as possible, as the true meaning of the holiday. It's a lousy message indeed! I guess, that message shouldn't be, much of a surprised, seeing how this film had a 2.8 million budget, wasted on, mostly filming at an actual expensive Christmas party in 2013. That's another reason why this film, is very unfunny interminable mess. The party was never that interesting, even with the odd hip-hop dance sequence and feasting scenes. Most of the characters there, were very annoying, or just uber-paranoid to care about. The humor that they were trying to pass in these party sequences as comedy really did fall flat. Not only that, but the film was horribly laziness edited, as well. This movie really did go a little too long, with endless amounts of fake endings, but it's not as irritating, as much as the film's too many opening lectures by Kirk Cameron. It takes forever for this film to start. I really didn't like it, because the entire movie, alright boils down to one long conversation in which Cameron, playing himself trying to lighten the mood of a Christmas Grinch of a brother in law, played by Darren Doane in a car. There is no reason for Kirk Cameron, to explain even more. Anyways, any dialogue that didn't seem like a lecture from Cameron, seem a bit overlapping, forced and wooden. I have to say, the acting in this film isn't that god-awful, but it's not even near as decent. Overall: Considering that American faith-based Christmas film has such a negative respond from critics, that even Cameron, himself try to sway backlash, by posting his followers, to give it, a better rating. I have to say, I'm pretty OK, with how this film was mistreated by the majority of the public, and I'm not really an Atheist. This film was indeed lousy. Yes, it might have some 'it's so bad, it's good' moments, that some viewers might find, entertaining, for the most part, I really can't recommended, watching this movie.

            "content": "For those of us who have watched Kirk Cameron pontificate on the wonders of the banana, or read his musings on the legitimacy of the existence of fire-breathing dragons, we know that Kirk Cameron himself is comedy gold. One might expect more hilarity from Cameron in Saving Christmas, but Cameron actually intentionally tries to build a comedy here, and the result is an unfunny, unfocused, interminable mess.The film begins with an uncomfortable scene involving Kirk Cameron sitting in a chair, lecturing at the audience. \"They don't want us to love Christmas,\" Cameron declares authoritatively, never bothering to define exactly who \"they\" are. Cameron drones on for several more minutes, and at this point in the film, I heard a kid in the back of the theater yawn loudly\u2014perhaps an audible protest that this film would not be the exciting romp promised on the poster.Finally, the film cuts away from Kirk Cameron, and we see several characters enjoying a Christmas party. But then we see Kirk Cameron again, the film freezes, and we hear Kirk Cameron narrating about himself: \"That's me\u2014Kirk!\" More lecturing ensues.Eventually, a character by the name of Christian (almost as clever as \"Josh Wheaton\"), a Christian himself, despondently finds his way to a car, apparently disillusioned by the materialism of Christmas. Enter Kirk Cameron, who enters the vehicle and does what he does best\u2014more lecturing.The majority of the film takes place in this car as Kirk lectures to Christian, with occasional cutaways to Biblical imagery. Cameron tries to make the case that Christmas traditions, such as celebratory trees and gifts, all somehow originated with Christianity, not paganism. (Never mind the fact that ancient paganism predates Christianity.) \"Last time I checked, God created the winter solstice!\" is the type of asinine reasoning you'll hear from Kirk Cameron throughout the film. Cameron's facts are both dubious and sparse, and his connections are spurious\u2014but Christian is nevertheless invariably blown away by Kirk Cameron's apparently amazing insight.Perhaps aware that interminable lecturing on its own would be unbearable for an audience, the film provides characters with quirky personalities in an effort to break up the tedium. In particular, we are treated to a scene back in the house of two characters rambling schizophrenically as they drink hot chocolate. It has nothing to do with Christian's story, it makes the movie feel unfocused, it goes on for far too long, and if my theater is any indication, it is not funny at all. In fact, there was dead silence in my theater throughout the entire run of this \"comedy\" film.The film ends with a dance sequence that feels like it lasts ten minutes, as well as multiple, gratuitous blooper scenes\u2014I suppose for no reason other than to pad the running time. Just when you think it's finally over, we see Kirk Cameron again, and he continues to lecture the audience\u2014this time about how materialism is just fine, because Jesus came to us in a material body, after all.One gets the impression that Kirk Cameron actually started reading his own Bible, was disturbed by what he found (such as Jesus' instruction to \"go sell your possessions and give to the poor\"), and produced this film as a desperate justification for his own hypocrisy.At my theater, nobody laughed, and nobody stayed for the end credits. This purported comedy film fails at every level. If you're really looking for a laugh, go back and take a look at what Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort have to say about the glorious design of the banana.",

And so is one Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas a \"film\" that was \"written\" and \"directed\" by former Blink-182 music video director Darren Doane, \"starring\" Kirk Cameron as, well, as himself, and his family and friends during his annual Christmas party. At least I suspect that's how this movie was made, Cameron was probably throwing a Christmas party and realized he could make a quick buck, got some cameras, and through this together in under an hour. There is little story to speak of, beyond Cameron preaching to the audience that rampant materialism in the holiday season is OKAY by Jesus was a corporeal being and therefore, material. Intercut within this overlong audience fillbuster are recreations of all the wonderful Christmas imagery we have come to know and love, like the soldiers of King Herod murdering hundreds of babies, and a terrifying-looking Saint Nicholas beating a man to death because he didn't agree with him. Cameron goes to great lengths to explain away holiday traditions like a decorated tree and gifts, but the audience will be far too distracted by the weird bunch-ups in Doane's Christmas sweater, and his weird, pause-filled delivery that will make you think he's some kind of serial killer. And of course, are film ends on a completely random hip-hop dance number that exists only so that Cameron can show us that yes, he can do the worm. This film we leave you scalping yourself because you're scratching your head in bewilderment, trying to comprehend what you've just seen. Even the likes of David Lynch would look at that movie and say it's too much.

            "content": "A question I kept thinking as I somehow went through Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas was 'how is this even a movie?' In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit I didn't go into this expecting it to be very good. That may be a fault on my end, to enter into any movie to do that, but the hype I had heard about this thing - that it was among the craziest pieces of WTF put to screen in the past several years (if ever) - made me too curious to not avoid it. I think also the idea of, frankly, Christian nutter Kirk Cameron going on about the War on Christmas made me wonder if he would make it a screed against those who would denigrate the most sacred of holidays... well, rest assured, it's not that. It's so much wilder than anything you'd hear on FOX News by a pundit. It's a unique specimen in how NOT to make something with a camera and sound equipment and what I guess are sets and maybe some actors(?) and a would-be director-cum-actor-cum-writer. I mean, Jesus this movie...First of all, it's not really a movie, not in the way that we have anything close to compelling characters or dialog together. What we get following an introduction by Cameron (playing himself) where he sips his hot cocoa smugly and bemoans those who don't enjoy Christmas whole-heartedly (smugly in that way that he is constantly smiling and literally preaching to the camera, surrounded by a fireplace and tree and the accouterments of the holiday), is the story of 'Christian' (GET IT?) who seems to be the sad-sod at the holiday party - also Cameron's brother in law - who isn't in the spirit. He is actually depicted harshly, all in voice-over of course (because why show us things when you can TELL us, at length), as someone who looks down on the Christmas holiday and isn't into the 'spirit' of the season. Cut to a Christian sitting in his parked car in the drive-way, and Kirk gets into the passenger seat. This is where the \"meat\" of the movie takes place. Boy howdy.This is a straw-man preach-fest, where Christian, after espousing actually (to me) *reasonable* thoughts about how the money and effort spent on putting up decorations and on presents and so on could be used to help feed the poor and do things that aren't part of actual teachings in the Bible as far as the trappings of the modern holiday goes. Here's where it gets weird: Cameron basically spends the rest of the movie, in really shoddy voice-over over \"scenes\" showing things like what the swaddling cloth the Baby Jesus was covered with and Christmas trees and Santa Claus actual mean and how they're \"REALLY\" connected to the Bible. In other words, it's all deep down justifying why things like the commercialization of the holiday, presents, hot f***ing chocolate, are fine in this time and age. And if the part about the swaddling cloth, and how he makes these connections that just are not there don't make you tear your hair out, the connection with Christmas trees to the *Christ on the Cross* will get you more.One might say that at least Cameron isn't really *mean* with his statements here, and it's certainly not the usual war on Christmas screed. No, the one part you get the latter is in a really jarring and rather unnecessary scene (as if anything here IS necessary to begin with, but even in this context) where it cuts to a scene in the party between two characters - one the (I'm not kidding) token black guy, and the token, uh, conspiracy theorist - and the latter brings up things like Loose Change and Fox News and the war on Christmas like... are we supposed to see him as crazy or a joke or believe him? Aside from being ludicrous (in the best possible way) as this character goes through a monologue with a mug over his mouth so that everything can be ADR'd, it seems so muddled. Is this a joke? What the hell did I just watch? Even if I believed whatever crazy horse-pucky that Cameron spouted here - and to give you an idea of how far out this stuff is, Republican president candidate (and fan of grain-in-the-pyramids theory) Ben Carson gives an endorsement on the DVD cover - the production quality is barely above that of Birdemic. Many shots are just really bizarrely staged (the scene between the two token characters is framed in such a way I want to show it to film school students to see if they know it's correct or not, if they think the former, they're automatically flunking, period). Other times, like the 'recreations' of what Cameron is preaching about in the car, it looks like they didn't have enough money for things like other actors to play the parts - I can't be sure but it looks like Kirk was \"Bad\" Santa in a couple of key shots - and on sets that look like they filmed on a stage in a high school auditorium. Oh, and there's a hip-hop dance sequence that pads out the run-time for what is essentially a LECTURE by Cameron, padded by the token characters and Christian the Straw-Man, and funded by a fundamentalist university.If you watch this and believe this stuff, I feel sorry for you. Go do your own research, see if you can challenge this guy on his claims. But even if everything he said was valid or had some credibility (and it doesn't), the quality of what went into this production makes it easily a contender for among the ten worst films of all time.",

A pity it had to be expressed with what some people consider to be the worst movie ever made. I remember Bill Maher criticizing \"Noah\" and later in the same year he criticized this. He thought \"Noah\" was the worst religious movie? It was so awesome proving him wrong! When I saw the trailer for this film, the movie itself seemed like a never ending commercial and that's exactly what I got! I guess \"Santa And The Ice Cream Bunny\" is technically a worse Christmas movie. That doesn't stop this from still being unwatchable.Everything about this shows idiocy. Even the company's logos aren't done right! We see a bunch of logos in the beginning and then four minutes later we get another logo appearing out of order! What?! How pathetic is a movie when you mess up that?! I think they even show it a third time when they introduce the movie's title! So this movie features Kirk Cameron telling his brother in law the true meaning of Christmas. I thought this would mostly take place in the car featuring them talking. It actually would have been better if it HAD been just that. It features Kirk talking about how Christmas trees represent the wooden cross Jesus was crucified on. First of all, that's pathetic. Second, what does Jesus dying even have anything to do with Christmas?! It would make more sense to have Easter trees! He does talk about the story of the real Saint Nicholas. Yes, he was indeed a real person and Santa Claus is in fact based on him. Except that it actually shows him beating someone up to show what a great guy he is! I'm serious, this movie says that attacking people who don't share your beliefs is okay. We get this weird scene before that which shows a guy dressed as Santa actually threatening the audience! I was sincerely scared by this part! So yeah, celebrate Christmas or we'll beat you up. The set design is horrendous. In the beginning, you can easily tell that Cameron is drinking from an empty cup. How cheap are you when you can't even afford hot chocolate on your set? The other main character is actually named Christian. He does seem to agree with Kirk after thirty minutes. They could have just ended the movie right there! Instead, they have some of the worst padding I have ever seen in my entire life! The use of slow motion is unbearably stupid. There's a scene where Christian actually slides into the room in slow motion. Is this trying to be an action movie or something? We get more scenes as the characters literally wave their hands around in slow motion. What does this mean?! We get scenes of everyone dancing and it's just slowed down, probably for no reason other than to fill the mere 79 minute length of this movie. It is one of the ugliest films to look at I've ever seen. So Christian learns his lesson and goes back and the screen freezes with the phrase \"Merry Christmas\". Well, the movie's over now, right? Nope! They show him talking about his wife and then it seems like it's ended, but it still hasn't! Then they dance everywhere and leave the scene. For the third time, this movie is over, right? NO! Then we see them eating and \"finally\" the credits come in. There's just outtakes. Is it over yet? No, we actually get the longest scene after the movie credits I have literally witnessed in my entire life. There's a two minute sequence that just shows people talking. These are the same things who earlier put cups over their mouths to talk about conspiracy theories. Yes, that really happened.The most insulting thing is probably at the end when Kirk tells the audience that it's okay to be materialistic. Why? He literally says it's because Jesus was the materialistic form of God. A human body is not a material. That goes against everything Christianity or the Bible or Jesus or whoever has ever said. If you want to justify Christmas decorations, here's how to do it. Just say that Christmas is a time where people work extra hard to get everything prepared so they can be with other people and be more charitable than any other time of year. Christmas cookies and presents might not be in the Bible, but that's the message that Christmas should have! Zero Stars",

This is pure torture.The acting is brutal throughout. Kirk is probably the least annoying yet he won two Razzies when Doane should have won one for playing a stammering nincompoop who looks like Al Snow.I'll be nice and say that they made St. Nicholas look like a total boss and the human beatbox old school rapping during the purposely overlong credits are good (I like old school freestyle rap) but the ridiculous myths about swaddling clothes, Christmas gifts looking like New Jerusalem and seeing a bunch of white people making Emily Ratajkowski look like Mikhail Baryshnikov when it comes to dancing will overwhelm any good bits this bore offers. If you want to laugh at a Fundie film, stick with A Thief In The Night. If you want a cure for insomnia, on the other hand...",

This movie is simply one of his more self indulgent tirades about the supposed removal of Christian themes at Christmas time and how we are all going to Hell. Or something similar. His complete lack of accuracy concerning the actual beginnings of the Christmas holiday not only make the movie a laughable joke, but also showcase his ignorance, therefore ALL Christian's ignorance (He seems to like taking credit for speaking for all Christians) A 10 minute search on the internet will inform even the most staunch Catholic that EVERY aspect of Christmas including the iconic Christmas tree, gift-giving, yule logs, etc, were all adapted by early Christian leaders from PAGAN sources! Here's another quick fact; Jesus wasn't born in December! He was probably born sometime during the Summer months. He is also apparently unaware that when the Puritans settled in America, they OUTLAWED all Christmas celebrations for almost 80 years! We are also treated to more whining about the removal of manger displays, etc from public areas. Yet not a single display on a truly PUBLIC area has been forced to be be removed by public outcry (at least none that I have heard about) Instead, most manger displays that have been removed were on State or Federal property! And yes, THIS IS a violation of the \"Separation of Church & State\" laws. All in all, the movie is a complete mess! Loaded with self indulgent garbage, this waste of film is also horribly written and directed with acting so far below par as to make a grade school play seems like Shakespeare in the Round.

At least those films had a few moments that were so-bad-they're good. This is an insult to intelligence! It currently stands at number 2 on this site's Bottom 100. I would place it top 10...there's just a few other films I've seen that I found worse.Let me start out by saying that I am a practising Catholic. I don't claim to be an expert on religion or the Bible as humility on the subject needs to be kept. Kirk Cameron could really use some of that too. Let me also say that there have been a few interviews where I agree with what Cameron debates. But this film made me lose all respect for him.Saving Christmas looks like a mockbuster. A \"mockbuster\" is a low-budget (sometimes micro- budget) rip-off of a huge film being released at the same time that is meant to capitalize on the bigger film's success. They look like they have a budget of $4. This movie literally looks like a micro-budget film. It stars Kirk Cameron playing himself who's hosting a Christmas party. The scenes that show the party are agonizing. The acting is unbelievably bad! His brother Christian is sick of the materialistic nature that Christmas has become and wants to put \"Christ\" back in \"Christmas.\" He hides out in his car to do some thinking where idiotic Kirk comes to talk to him about his insecurities. This is the plot and it doesn't sound that bad eh? Only Kirk Cameron and company could take a subject worthy of discussion and spin it out of control.So what's so bad about the story? Sure the acting is horrid and the budget is low, but that's not the worst. The majority of the movie takes place in Christian's car with Cameron doing voice-overs in dramatizations of what he's taking about. Those dramatizations are very bad and unnecessary. It could have been a \"My Dinner With Andre\" style and kept the camera on them the whole time, but nooooooo. The technological issues are bad enough, and these little scenes just add fuel to the fire! And what Kirk talks about are all wrong and make no sense. The first thing that Christian complains about is the materialistic possession in Christmas and Kirk says all that stuff is great. Right away that's wrong. And he just goes on to randomly and falsely talk about Jesus' birth without even saying how that ties in with Christian's issue. Next is his shpeel about Christmas trees. Again, wrong explanation! And Kirk saying why Christmas is celebrated on December 25 is wrong too! Studies show that He was born around August. And that goes on and on with what feels like forever.Kirk Cameron's buddy in Christian director and pastor Alex Kendrick who I think is great. He could not save this mess. Any self-respecting Christian or anybody with half a brain can see that this is not a good film. It practically makes a mockery of the Messiah! Cameron caused a backlash with what he said was done by \"atheists.\" It's not just atheists, it is also Christians that know better than you, Kirk!Instead of making a movie about Christ in Christmas, get somebody who knows their stuff to do a documentary on the subject.0/4",

There is really just two locations, interior of a house and of a car. The thing is that the car goes nowhere, just sits in a driveway. I mean come on, you're in a car- go somewhere. It would be like watching a space film and the spaceship just sits in space dock. Second is the acting. This Darren Doane director can't act at all. Even Kirk is bad, there is a scene right at the beginning where he is supposed to be drinking hot Cocoa and I can tell the cup is empty. And then there is another scene where Kirk in a Santa outfit looks directly into the camera with a serial killer grin on his face. The direction is bad too, for example there is a scene where a white guy and the token black guy is talking and they hold cups up to their faces and cover their mouths. Huh? In that scene you can tell that most if not all of their dialogue was recorded way after the fact via ADR. Then we get to the direction and editing. This film would probably run less than one hour if it weren't for the needless padding and pauses. Scenes are padded with dialogue that adds nothing to the story and then there are long pauses where it looks like they are just pausing for no good reason. And in addition to that the running time is further padded with the extreme overuse of slow motion.People will walk around in a scene in slow motion for no good reason. One could literally have a drinking game just using the slow motion scenes. I was watching this and right around the 58 minute mark I thought it was over when a photo of everyone with Santa says Merry Christmas. But nope, it's further extended by more scenes of slow motion and needless padding. We watch a poorly choreographed dance segment. You can tell they tried, but these dancers are just so not synced with the others. If you're going to take the time to learn a dance, practice it over and over so the entire group looks polished instead of looking like a buffed hunk of coal. There is even slow motion during the dance segment. Then the end credits is further padded with some very unfunny bloopers. This is also the first time I saw end credits where none of the cast are given roles. And what's up with the cast? Looks like most of the cast is somehow related to someone on the crew. Just when I thought the movie was over the final 2 1/2 minutes is another scene of the white guy and the token black guy and the white guy doing an awful \"Kirk Kirk Kirk Cameron\" rap.

I didn't read much about the plot, I had my guesses what it would involve, I knew I had to watch to see why it was bad. Basically, the film opens with Kirk (Razzie winning Kirk Cameron) talking to the audience beside a fireplace, explaining his love of Christmas. He expresses his views on the contemporary celebration of Christmas, questioning if people have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas, i.e. the Christian story of the birth of Christ, and that the holiday may have become overwhelmed by modern traditions. He explains that many see Christmas as an excuse to spoil kids, pretence and obligations, having perverted symbols with hidden meaning, a pointless distraction, and having needless spending, commercialism, he also mentions many believe it to be a worship for atheists, paganism and elf worship. It then switches to the main narrative, where Kirk attends a Christmas party at his sister's house. He notices that his brother-in-law, Christian (Darren Doane, also writing, producing, and directing), is not celebrating like the other guests. When asked why, Christian tells Kirk that he feels the holiday became too commercialised and consumerist and mentions the Pagan elements. Kirk tells Christian he is wrong and recites the Nativity, seen in cartoon form. Meanwhile, Diondre (David Shannon) and another guest (Raphi Henley) discuss conspiracy theories. Kirk later finds Christian hiding in the car. Christian complains that several elements of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees and Santa Claus, are not biblical in origin. Kirk tells the stories of why Christmas trees and Santa truly are in fact religious things. The trees were created by God, appearing in the Garden of Eden, that baubles on trees represent the fruit that Adam and Eve ate, and the lights on them can be seen as the light of God. Christian suggests the name \"Santa\" is an anagram of \"Satan\" and that he is not a Christian figure. However, Kirk explains that Santa Claus is Saint Nicholas, and was in fact a representative for God, giving presents for those who truly believed. Kirk also suggests that Jesus was brought into the world to die, that his gifts of frankincense and myrrh were given to be used in his burial, and that he was born and died in the same material. Reassured of Christmas' Christian roots, Cameron and Christian return to the party. Kirk issues a plea to the audience to make Christmas an overtly religious holiday again, \"for our children\". Then the guests perform a hip hop song and breakdance, set to \"Angels We Have Heard on High\". It ends with Kirk telling everyone to feast, suggests the audience organise the best dinner possible for Christmas, but not to forget it is a celebration of God. Also starring Razzie nominated Bridgette Cameron as Kirk's Sister, and Ben Kientz as St. Nick. From the title, I thought this was going to be a simple predictable film about a guy \"saving Christmas\" in some kind of adventure, but I got nothing like that at all. If this is supposed to be funny, I wasn't laughing, I just found the film an excuse for Christian preaching. Almost the entirety of the film was ramming the Christian belief down our throats, and it felt really patronising also. I will admit the comparisons of Christian traditions to things in Christmas we recognise, and embrace was fairly interesting, but it doesn't make me want to recognise Christianity. The poppy version of Silent Night during the opening credits was fairly catchy as well. Obviously, I do recognise the birth of Jesus as being the origin of the holiday, but I just see Christmas as a fun time with the family, with good food, presents, decorations, songs, and films and TV. People should be allowed to celebrate Christmas however they want, and not have religion force-fed to them, and that is why I found this an annoying, unfunny and pointless seasonal comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay for Darren Doane and Cheston Hervey, and Worst Screen Combo for Kirk Cameron & His Ego, and it was nominated for Worst Director for Darren Doane.

Because Saving Christmas fits the bill, I've given it that rarest of honors.When Kirk (Kirk Cameron) sees that his friend Christian (Darren Doane) isn't enjoying Christmas, he sits down with him to explain away his concerns about the holiday.I once saw a movie called Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny that was worse than Saving Christmas. I guess that's about the best I can say about it.The movie feels like a short film drawn out to an hour and twenty minutes. The main \"narrative\" involves 38 minutes of two men sitting in a car interrupted by slow motion flashbacks and fifteen minutes afterward dedicated to a dance sequence and credits/bloopers. That leaves the remaining half hour or so for slow motion footage, plodding narrations, and an obsession with hot chocolate. This is a movie that is terribly difficult to sit through.While it's clear that the film's technical integrity was at best a quickly abandoned afterthought in favor of its thematic material, the fact that it fails there as well is damning evidence of how poor this movie is. Saving Christmas isn't even about putting Christ back in Christmas, as the poster claims, but is instead about Cameron making up some spots to stick Him in. Much of the movie consists of Cameron explaining to his friend how different traditions had Christian meanings all along, such as Christmas trees representing Christ's cross, presents representing city skylines, and snow globes representing nativity scenes. The cast is likely a group of people that Cameron knows, and let's just say the few non-white people present really stand out. The only black character with a speaking role, Diondre (played by a man named David), is a jive-talkin', hip-hop-lovin' DJ who fits just about every stereotype you would expect of a man in this kind of movie.The worst part of this film, both onscreen and off, is Kirk Cameron himself. From this movie and the events surrounding its release, he strikes me as arrogant and self-aggrandizing. Every smug, nonsensical explanation that he offers to his friend is met with immediate awe and reverence. In reality, what he says throughout the film is at best naive and at worst falsehoods, distortions, and misrepresentations of both Christian and pagan histories. The fact that Cameron wrote these interactions framing himself as flawlessly as he did says something about the man's character.He goes as far as to praise Christmas-season materialism by declaring it to be a way to thank God for taking on a material body. That comparison is inherently trivial, as beyond the equivocation of the word \"material\", Cameron is describing every holiday and how it is celebrated. That is, of course, unless there is some ethereal holiday that cannot be celebrated by any physical means. What am I even talking about at this point?Saving Christmas is among the worst movies I've ever seen. It is an abject failure in all matters spiritual, historical, visual, audible, and ethical. At the core of this travesty is a pretentious, one-man charge toward desperate re-appropriation of Christmas traditions by a man who sees himself as our cultural savior. The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the message is bad, the music is bad, the dancing is bad, the jokes is bad, and the hot chocolate is probably bad. Do not watch this movie.",

Worst, the film completely misses its own point.Cameron has blamed \"atheists\" and \"haters\" for the bottom-of-the-barrel reviews this pile has garnered, but he gives those groups far too much credit.

Kirk Cameron seems to not understand that the Protestant Christianity that he ascribes to was born out Catholicism, which in turn derives from Judaism. What caused the schism is that there were too many \"unacceptable rules\", like clergy can't get married, no divorce, etc(See Henry VIII) People like Cameron have no faith. Faith, by definition, is belief without certainty or knowledge. Evangelicals are certain there is a God, and even more certain that everything they say, do, and believe is exactly what God wants. The arrogance and total lack of personal humility in these people is astounding and disgraceful. I can't imagine any God who isn't disgusted by their hateful speech and behavior. That being said, sometimes I feel guilty(being a good Irish Catholic American boy), so I decided to see \"Saving Christmas\" with no judgment or presupposition in mind. To say the least, it was horrifying, and a giant pile of steaming Ode to Cameron's immeasurable ego. Essentially like all of Kirk's films, He(Cameron) is in-the-know, and everyone else who disagrees with him, Jew, Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, or any other non-evang. sect of Protestantism is going to hell. To my credit by the way, I saw it all the way through.BTW, if you read the very first reviews on IMDb, all 10 stars from his brainwashed, small-minded followers. Research the movie, Cameron actually encouraged his flock to try and boost the ratings on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. It backfired, which, to me, says that there are more good people who despise hypocritical judgment of others in the guise of religious fervor than not. That's encouraging.",

Even though I'm not Pagan, they didn't have to be jerks about another person's beliefs. 4: The whole thing attempts to justify their \"reasons\" of saying how great commercialism is and that it's apparently part of the Christmas tradition.(Warning) This movie is a polished piece of crap. \"From the acting, the writing, and of how a glorified job that the director did of making this film.

It stated that the symbols of Christmas that are based of Germanic rituals (like the tree) are all connected to the birth of Jesus, what it is not.And at the end it is saying that materialism is a good thing.

As he grew up however, and found religion, he moved away from the normal Hollywood fare and started making \"Christian\" movies. Now I don't care about any of that. If a movie has a Christian message it's fine so long as the movie is good. But this movie is far from good and just shows the utter drek that \"Christian\" movies tend to provide.The movie is supposed to provide a \"new\" understanding of Christmas and what it means. When you get down to it, it's a pagan holiday with all it's trappings that was co-opted by the early church. The people didn't care because they still got to party like they did before but instead of it being a celebration of the end of the year and a feast in honor of Saturn, it was now about Jesus. What we get instead is something that looks like a home movie and Kirk Cameron and the director sitting in a car for most of the run time and talking. Well it's more like Kirk lecturing to the other guy about the meaning of Christmas and injecting new information which the other guy just accepts as being true without questioning. Kirk even admits at some point that these stories are just that, they're just stories. But new stories in an attempt to change the way the holiday is seen. In a sense he's trying to rewrite history in order to match his personal views.Along the way there's some bad attempts at comedy here and there and, I kid you now, a 10 minute dance scene at the end that just feels like it was there to pad out the running time. And even then the movie is barely 80 minutes long.Rightfully this was savaged by the critics and the audience who saw it for what it was. And the most ironic thing is that Kirk actually asked Christians to go and rig the vote on \"Rotten Tomatoes\" to bump up the score whether they had seen the movie or not. That's right. Kirk was asking people to lie which, as far as I remember, is not something that his God looks too favorably upon. That was met with the Streisand Effect and if anything it drove the score even lower.This is a misguided movie in every sense of the word.",

Cameron's vested interest in this project became clear when he took to Facebook imploring his followers to inflate the poor ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. However, had he might have done better to put half as much energy into a competent production and perhaps a marginal amount of historical research. For that matter,Cameron could use a refresher on his own holy book (how about starting with Hebrews 13:5, 1 Timothy 6:10, Matthew 6:24, Acts 8:20, Isaiah 46:6?)

Thus, giving mainstream Christianity a horrible image.

The film goes like this, needlessly long introduction scene, followed by a random scene from a different time period that isn't explained until its shown again in its full length 40 minutes later- and then we finally start the film. Those first 10 minutes already go to show you how much of a mess this film is and unfortunately, it's probably the best this film has to offer. We focus on a large generic family during Christmas and we soon see the dead-eyes of Kirk Cameron talking about beating up his sisters husband. We then see said husband conversing with an overly-stereotypical black man somehow relating Christmas and the bible to crazy shirt Fridays and playing the victim as straight men. We then spend the next 40 minutes or so (truly it feels like 6 hours) watching the husband talk with Kirk Cameron in a car in their driveway. Again and again the scene starts with the husband asking how something relates to Christmas and then Kirk Cameron goes into an unrelated monologue for about 15 minutes that's as inaccurate and tiresome as it is just poorly filmed- as the cutaway scenes are nearly all stock footage. Eventually the husband character decides to grow a pair and face his family and runs up to the door in a very dramatic fashion only for everyone to stare at him standing in the doorway for what must be like 10 minutes as he stares at them back with rage induced eyes. He then starts freaking running towards them hilariously and decides to fall on the floor and crash into the presents, and everyone's just like, okay then and walks away. Then eventually he consoles his wife for not being Christian enough for the holidays and starts a hip hop dance group scene which comes out of absolutely nowhere and may just be the longest thing i've ever had to watch. It's also not until that moment that Kirk finally comes out of the doorway he has been standing in for like 25 minutes with the door open and starts cheering and dancing. I don't have a single good thing to say about this film, and i'm honestly surprised this wasn't intended as a parody of some kind, because it's honestly so ridiculous I was laughing so hard all the way throughout. There is literally a scene where a man talks about how fluoride in the water is giving people aspergers, and that he saw it on Fox news.

More accurately, it never should have been released at all. All this film equates to is a big stroke of Cameron's ego. He is clearly in love with himself, and I'm sure every review, good or bad, makes him feel all the more confident. It's sad, but true. Or, maybe he was just trying to do something nice for his family. If you have the money, why not make a movie with your sister so she can feel like a star too. Unfortunately, she probably feels more shame than good.There is no doubt here. This is a bad movie. Yes, I might even say it's the worst movie ever. I've never walked out on a movie before, and that record still holds. However, the thought passed my mind several times while watching. I now feel ashamed of myself that I did not. The bastardization of Christianity that this movie inflicts upon the viewer is almost unbearable. I'm sad to know that I supported Mr. Cameron by paying to see this film. However, I am happy to see this filth voted into oblivion.",

Now writing, this has to be a small Christmas miracle in itself, he managed to offend atheist and Christians at the same time. Embrace the commercialism and because Jesus was god made flesh would should indulge the flesh and buy, buy, buy. \"Picture the wrapped gifts as the New Jerusalem\" and point taken from some far fetched sermon about the most important part of Christmas is the swaddling cloth. I wish I was joking but you just can't make this stuff up. Last there is the directing choices, hey let's shoot the most of it with 2 guys sitting in a car.

We get various scenes atrociously acted out, with grade school-level production values, and horrible dubbing, in attempt to shove KC's warped views on us, and to distract us from the fact that we are watching a movie about two people sitting in a parked car, talking for an hour. Yes, even including the lengthy pauses in dialogue reading, the stuttering and stammering, the ridiculous overuse of slow motion, and the comically long, drawn out intro, this movie is barely an hour long. So what's a wannabe filmmaker to do if their film is only a scant 60 minutes long? Pad out the runtime with slow motion dancing, blooper reels, and various other outtakes and filler material, that's what! 20 minutes worth of that can barely bring the film up to its current 80 minutes run time, and it's a long 80 minutes . Barely even \"so bad it's good\", mostly just dull and ponderous, and kind of creepy at times. The guy playing Santa in the film looks like he's straight out of Silent Night, Deadly Night.My favourite line: \"This is a complete hijacking! This is a hijacking! High-handed, hijacking! Handedness-jacking! It's like a car-jacking of our religion!\" Paranoid. Delusional. (Awful) stream-of-consciousness. Ad-libbed? Did they really intend lines like that to be taken seriously?",

            "review_title": "Terrible Film, Even Worse Message",
            "content": "Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas (perhaps the most pretentious title in history) is aggressively, offensively bad. Not just because it's ineptly written, directed, and acted, though it's absolutely all of that. What makes this film remarkably awful is the message that it seeks to convey.According to reports, the movie was filmed for $500,000. I have no idea where all that money went. If this tripe took more than five days to shoot I would be shocked. The entire film takes place in the kitchen, den, and foyer of a gigantic house, and the front seat of an SUV. It's as visually riveting as it sounds. A few historical asides take us back to biblical times, but they look like they could have been shot in the family barn.The cinematography is wretched. Characters are constantly hidden behind kitchen counters, poinsettias, or cups of cocoa. The lighting is stale, as if the entire house is lit by hospital-grade halogen bulbs. Director Darren Doane can't seem to properly frame a single scene in such a way that it makes anything seem natural or organic. Somehow Doane manages to make these common locations seem fake!The script is a mess. The only character that seems real is Cameron, and he's simply playing himself. Almost the entire film is a conversation between two men in a car. Occasionally, it cuts to nameless characters having short discussions that have nothing to do with anything else, and then it's right back to the driveway for more lecturing. None of the characters have any tangible personalities, aside from Cameron's windbag and a fat black man who borders on a stereotype. The movie is billed as a comedy, but no one actually says or does anything \"funny.\"The whole movie barely makes it to an 80-minute run-time. And it only gets there because it features a 5 minute dance sequence and 10 minutes of bloopers over the credits. Doane also pads the length by slipping in slow-motion when it's absolutely uncalled for. Somehow, 60 minutes of movie crammed into 80 still feels interminably long.So yes, the movie is junk. But, more importantly, it's terrible in principle.What is suggested by the trailer and poster is a take on the \"War on Christmas\" waged by atheists, corporations, and various other Scrooges. While that subject has been beaten to death, it might actually be possible to make a passable film about \"saving\" Christmas from these wet blankets. But that's not this film. Aside from a brief conversation between two unnamed characters, the subject of the \"War on Christmas\" is entirely absent. And even then, it's argued by a character who obviously believes in a slew of conspiracy theories, so the audience gets the impression that the secularization of Christmas is a myth.Instead, the Grinches that Kirk Cameron is saving Christmas from are Christians who are opposed to the secularization and materialism of the modern Christmas. Try to follow here: Kirk's brother-in-law, Christian (played by Doane) can't get into Christmas this year because he can't seem to find Christ in the material trappings of the season. Christian ducks out of his own party and sits in his car so that his bad mood won't bum out everyone else, especially his wife and kids. Now, this is a Christian-oriented movie, so you would assume that his focus on Christ and the feelings of his friends and family would make Christian the sympathetic protagonist. WRONG! He's a gullible fool who \"drank the Kool-Aid\" (Kirk's words), and Cameron is going to march out to that SUV and set him straight. Suffice it to say that Cameron is able to put Christ into every symbol of the holiday, no matter the actual origins.I'm a believing, practicing Christian. I accept the fact that Christmas trees and other traditions have their origins in Pagan practice, because these symbols have been co-opted and no longer carry their original meaning. But I understand any Christian who feels like they are Pagan symbols and shouldn't be celebrated. To each his own. I also understand folks who feel the need to read religious meaning into practices that have no religious source. Cameron falls squarely into the latter group. Many critics have taken the film to task over the dubious histories of trees, Santa Claus, etc that his character spouts throughout his lecturing of his brother-in-law. If that bothers you, too, so be it. I don't care to what extent one feels the need to convince himself that his celebrations fit within the framework of his faith. But the downright evil message of Saving Christmas goes well beyond inanities like \"God created the Winter Solstice.\" Cameron defends materialism and consumerism because \"Christ took material form.\" It doesn't matter how much you spend, eat, or spoil your kids as long as you make even the most simplistic attempt at celebrating Christ. In the final scene, Kirk says \"buy the biggest ham and the richest butter.\" He adds \"don't max out your credit cards,\" but everything he has said for the preceding 79 minutes suggests that he doesn't really mean that. At one point, Christian asks Kirk \"how many kids could we have fed\u0085 how many wells could we have dug\" with the money spent on the party? Cameron responds with nothing more than \"You've got it all wrong.\" But, Kirk doesn't actually have any example of how Christian is wrong. How could he? Of course money is better spent on charity than a lavish party! But does Kirk care?This film is a celebration of greed. It suggests absolutely no concern for one's fellow man. It's a terrible movie with a terrible message. Watch it and laugh, if that's your thing. Either way, take a moment to lament the fact that there really are people who think like Kirk Cameron.",

You can just look up the two scenes worth watching: the scene where the alien wearing Kirk Cameron like a skin suit is drinking from what is clearly an empty cup and the one where santa is beating up some dude to a dubstep soundtrack (in slow motion of course).",

            "content": "It would have been better to have shown this movie on television on a religious network. But even then, the ratings would have been terrible. Only the most die-hard fundamentalist trying to squeeze a Christian meaning out of every Christmas symbol would have liked this movie. The only Xmas show I've seen that's worse than this is the Star Wars Holiday Special (on YouTube), which has never been re-broadcast since 1978 or released on home video.Christian, Kirk's brother-in-law, is complaining about how so many of the symbols of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees, are not biblical in origin. Kirk, in his revisionism, goes way out on a limb to deny the pagan origins of the symbols and traditions of Christmas. He tells Christian that Christmas trees were God's idea, since he made the trees. He also says that each tree represents a Christian cross. Christian then starts complaining about Santa Claus. He sees Santa as replacing Jesus and notices that \"Santa\" and \"Satan\" have the same letters -- what a stretch. But Kirk tells him that the original Santa Claus was actually Saint Nicholas -- who in actuality was one of several sources for the character. Kirk ends his lecture be saying that the presents under the tree represent the buildings of New Jerusalem. The last 15-20 minutes are partying, eating, and bloopers.A conspiracy theorist, meanwhile, is complaining about the removal of public manger scenes, and says they're be removed to Area 52, which he says is similar to Area 51.Kirk's brother-in-law's real name, by the way, is John Ridenour. His name Christian in the movie is probably meant to represent Christians disappointed about the non-religious symbols of Christmas. Christian at one point says, \"It's like a car-jacking of our religion!\" This is probably a hint that Kirk, along with some Christians, doesn't like the loss of Christian dominance over the holiday season.Kirk's response to the failure of his movie was to blame it on a massive atheist conspiracy. Some people just don't like criticism. When they can't debate their opponents, they demonize them.If you want a good show about Christmas, I highly recommend History Channel's \"Christmas Unwrapped: The History of Christmas.\" It provides an excellent history of the symbols and traditions of the holiday, and shows the different views of it. \"Saving Christmas\" is at the opposite end of the spectrum.",

The bible even confirms these facts yet Christians blindly believe that Dec. 25th is Jesus's birthday and no matter what proof is given to support this fact just the mere suggestion to this reality will label you an atheist at best or sacrilegious at worst.I did in fact watch this movie. The time spent doing so, I will never get back. Disregarding my poor judgment in watching this movie I will give a few observations regarding how I felt about what I saw with these burning orbs still scarred and traumatized at this very minute.No spoilers given. The movie opens with a Kirk Cameron monologue followed by a sad attempt at a James Earl Jones like narration on the history of Christianity and Christmas. Although I did enjoy the ska interpretation of Christmas music in the beginning sadly it all went down hill from there. The production value sound and camera-work was top notch and reflected highly on the skill of the crew in Hollywood who work hard everyday with little to no appreciation for their troubles as in most cases the only people recognized are the Director and Actors involved. The continued use of narration by Kirk Cameron interlaced by his own opinions on the matters presented begin to wear thin on the viewer in such a way as to become annoying.It was a difficult road to continue to watch this movie to its conclusion. I began to see and think about the perfect means of torturing enemy combatants by forcing them to watch this film on repeat. It was a chore to scrub the feeling from my mind that I was in fact being tortured or perhaps hated myself for purposely assaulting my senses with this pure propaganda piece. It was highly predictable, highly annoying, and the continued forceful narration by Kirk Cameron drove rusted railroad spikes into my ears like a Toolbox Murders horror movie.I won't spoil the plot as there was none to spoil. If you value your time, your sanity and you like yourself perhaps you shouldn't be so unkind to assault your eyes and ears with this predictable, over narrated, imitation docudrama.As a real Christian who does not follow the Pope, a Church, idolize any single person famous or infamous, I only follow my heart, my convictions, my love for humanity, my hope for peace and happiness for all mankind.If I could rate this movie .01/10 I would, and after watching this drivel I would wish that IMDb would allow us the option to rate 0/10.",

He also was developing into an amateur theologian. Saving Christmas is the culmination of his self taught theology.This film was made in response to the secularization of Christmas as fundamentalists see it. Kirk in this message gives all the religious reasons for certain holiday traditions from his perspective.The film is an amateur job from Liberty Baptist University which should tell you all you need to know. The threadbare plot has Kirk explaining to his brother-in-law all the reasons for Christmas traditions going back to Adam and Eve. The adaption of certain pagan rituals is conveniently left out. The birth of Jesus is the reason for everything in the season. NOT.Of course there's a hip-hop version of Hark The Herald Angels Sing. I'll take mine traditional though. Saving Christmas was once at rock bottom of worst film ever. That was more a stand against Kirk Cameron's fundamentalism and all that implies with homophobia and sexism and a general war on progress.

Kirk Cameron, the formerly popular teen actor turned born-again Christian, is off to save Christmas and what does he do? He stalls inside a car with his brother-in-law Christian (Darren Doane) and lectures to him and the audience about the true meaning of Christmas and the birth of Jesus. Saving Christmas is more about inflating Cameron's ego than spreading the holiday cheer to all your friends. Despite being a Christian, Cameron contradicts his own religious philosophy of love and forgiveness and suggests that Saint Nicholas, the originator of Santa Claus, murdered heretics when not giving presents. I guess Cameron was trying to be ironic with his \"Lord of the Ringsy\" take on the figure, but instead it comes off as mean-spirited, especially in a Christmas movie. To be fair, the joke might have worked in a tongue-and-cheek sense, if the other characters weren't so poorly-written. Christian is a one-dimensional Scrooge in the mud, the atheist conspirators contribute nothing and neither do any of the party-goers, including Kirk's sister Bridgette, except a dance number. Seeing the characters' lack of onscreen presence only adds to Kirk Cameron's overlong sanctimonious preachiness; that's me a film lover in general. If Kirk Cameron is reading this post (I seriously doubt that he is), I apologize for being a \"hater and atheist,\" but Saving Christmas wasn't very good.

Kirk Cameron addresses the camera while seated in a chair the fireplace that this film should be tossed in. He drinks an empty mug of hot chocolate while delivering a cocky explanation behind the season. Structure of this holiday travesty takes place in a car where director Darren Doane plays the husband to Cameron's sister. As bad as Cameron's performance is, Doane makes Cameron look like Marlon Brando in comparison. Doane cannot express himself and he backs down quickly with every argument Cameron makes with regards to the Bible and Santa Claus, reindeer, Christmas trees, and other such elements. Cameron presents arguments that blend with Biblical elements and this might have worked had it been handled with the skill that Doane doesn't possess. As bad as Doane is as an actor, his directing skills are not even worthy of a Burger King commercial. Doane will eventually have his arguments overturned before throwing himself sliding into the tree and starting a really lame dance number. Bridgette Ridenour as Doane's wife is another personality defect in this film. She slaves about this Christmas party with a sour face. Finally we have the witless stereotypical black guy that is blatantly embarrassing. The aim is examining the Bible verses current Christmas celebrations. A superior filmmaker can highlight these themes properly, but Doane not only fails to save Christmas, he takes a massive sh*t on it. Score: 2 / 10",

I watched it to laugh at the hypocrisy and the leaps and bounds in logic that Kirk Cameron takes, and it delivered in that regard. Right off the bat, Kirk starts projecting by claiming there's people who want Christians to keep their holiday spirit it to themselves. Where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, like how homophobic Christians pushed \"don't ask, don't tell\"?The entire next hour or so is just as disastrous as the introduction. Kirk tries (and succeeds, way too easily, I might add, especially when it looks like he's about to laugh in his face each time Kirk finishes a lecture) to win over his brother in law - the none-too-subtly named Christian White - with absurd arguments that today's Christmas symbolism is, in fact, rooted in the Bible and has nothing to do with idolatry or paganism whatsoever, and finally argues that materialism is good because Christ is God in his \"material\" form. Which... no. Just no. We're talking about two different meanings of the word \"material\". And besides, the gospels EXPLICITLY condemn wealth. It still feels weird having to explain the Bible to fundamentalist Christians as an apostate, yet here I am. Also, Kirk arguing that nutcrackers, who according to him represent the soldiers of King Herod that tried to kill Jesus when he was a baby, have a place in Christmas decorations because they're part of the story of Jesus, despite never actually killing him but killing a bunch of other innocent babies. Oh, really? Well if that were so, then why don't we have decorations of Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate out on Easter? They were directly responsible for Jesus' crucifixion, so why aren't THEY treated with the same respect given to nutcrackers/Herod's soldiers on Christmas?There are maybe a few valid points that Kirk makes every once in a while. You know what they say about broken clocks, after all. Of course symbols see usage across several different cultures. Just look at the swastika and the pentagram, for instance. But he forgets that - according to Christianity - if the symbol is being used by pagans, it's blasphemy and idolatry, whereas with Christians, it's completely acceptable. Similarly, the movie makes jabs at conspiracy theorists who willingly swallow and digest whatever Alex Jones tells them whatever the government is secretly doing. I love a dig at those whackjobs as much as any relatively sane person, but the hypocrisy comes in when you remember Kirk believes IN EARNEST that there's a war on Christmas and that Christians are being expected to keep it to themselves, and engages in just as many ridiculous mental gymnastics as they do to justify the use of materialism and symbols of pagan origin on a supposedly Christian holiday.Honestly, I would recommend watching this movie at least once. It's good for a laugh, and unlike certain other Christian propaganda flicks, it doesn't really cause any harm. Sure, the token black character is clearly supposed to be the stereotypical comic relief, and the glorification of materialism is all wrong, but otherwise it doesn't make the dangerous generalizations or give terrible advice for its target audience that they'd expect them to take to heart like God's Not Dead.",

            "content": "The introduction was slow. The five of us were in our queen-sized bed watching it on my laptop, and my 6-year-old passed out before the introduction was over. Not knowing about the movie prior, I would have thought this was how it was going to be throughout it, which made me a little nervous. I kept looking over at my 9-year-old to check if she was still paying attention. Thankfully she's got a longer attention span than my 6-year-old.The movie starts with Kirk Cameron attending his sister's huge Christmas party that she throws every year. The house is gorgeous\u2013 everything is decorated beautifully, there are a ton of people and lots of food. Kirk asks his sister where her husband is, and she explains he's just not feeling Christmas this year. Kirk then goes out to the car where he finds his brother-in-law sulking and grouchy, complaining about how all of this STUFF isn't what Christmas is really about! How it's all Pagan!Kirk goes on to combat each one of his brother-in-law's objections about the Christmas traditions; the Christmas tree, Santa, Christmas lights, and gifts. Each objection is given a story. My 9-year-old's favorite was seeing Santa beat a guy up! You'll have to watch the movie to find out why Santa beats this man up:)Overall, I enjoyed the content of the movie--not the fluff. Some parts were really corny, but I think that was Kirk's intent. They poked fun at Pentecostal Christians. There were several scenes where I found myself saying, \"I don't understand how this fits?\" or \"I don't feel this explains his intent very well.\" Santa was spot-on, but a lot of the explanations seemed like a very high-level overview that left me feeling a lot like Concrete Blonde's lyrics:These little conversations Well for me they'll never do Now what am I supposed to do with Broken sentences of you? Like a book with missing pages Like a story incomplete Like a painting left unfinished It feels like not enough to eat.I would have loved to see more depth to the stories told. The movie is about 69 minutes long, 30 minutes of which had content\u0085 the rest was just, \"fluff\". I'm not sure I would spend $10 at the theater for it. It's more suited for a TV special.Towards the end of the movie, there is a hip hop dancing scene that made me really uncomfortable. From reading the credits, I understand this is some sort of faith-based hip hop dance crew, but I felt it wasn't very appropriate for the movie. I wouldn't consider myself a prude, either\u0085it just felt odd.If you ignore those minor details, I think you'll enjoy this movie, too! This was unlike some of Kirk Cameron's movies that are more like a documentary\u2013this was part story, part documentary...I think.I think what sealed the deal on the film was what Kirk said in summary,\"We need to make traditions of our own. We need to infuse old symbols with new meaning. We need to arrange our lives and our homes so that every single thing points to Jesus. \"Also,\"Remind your children that every character in God's story has a place.\"",

He has about the same intellectual capacity for rational thought as my poodle. I actually think he may be a robot. He manages to say something that would offend every demographic group out there in a way not seen since Andrew Dice Clay, only he's not trying to be funny (I think, not sure). Wife wanted to hang out in the restroom rather than sitting through any more cinematic defecation, but I couldn't tear myself away. Had to leave before the much hyped dance sequence.

I remember VC Andrews writing in the book \"Flowers in the Attic\" on how believing in God is a good thing, but when one takes what they see in the Bible and puts their own spin on the writings, that is hypocrisy. Kirk Cameron does that. His BIL in this movie is complaining about how commercialized Christmas has become and I do think the guy has a point. He worries about people who spend an arm and a leg on Christmas and in that process forget about people who are truly needy! Kirk's thought is everyone should spend tons of money on the best food, best gifts, and best decorations or they don't know the true meaning of Christmas. Strange, isn't it? A great man was born thousands of years ago who preached about helping others and giving away possessions. This great man is named Jesus Christ aka JC for the modern age and He is the one Kirk allegedly follows. I don't think so! In the meanwhile, I will search on RedBoxfor this movie, but I do believe what the other posters say. I did see this movie on YouTube and I agree with what the other posters say more strongly now! To show the future Santa Claus as a scary guy who beats people up because they don't agree with him is offensive to kids who are taught not to strike anyone. I always thought the 3 Wisemen brought gold and other fragrant resins to the Baby Jesus was their way of honoring a future king.

Well, if that's you, then I just want to tell you this: you're not.Christians should watch this movie to learn how not to debate theology. Film students should watch this to learn how not to make a movie. Logic professors should mention this film in their classes as an example of the uses of red herrings, straw men, and other fallacies in popular entertainment.Kirk Cameron appears to have moved on from this movie.

In my opinion, an hour long television program would have been a better format for this effort, than an hour and twenty minute theatrical release.It is a low-budget digital independent film, and the production values reflect that. It sets out to present a conservative Christian point of view, and does that openly and unapologetically. There was nothing that I found intolerant or mean spirited, and it seemed rather to espouse traditional Christian values of Christmas, such as \"Peace on Earth, Goodwill toward All\" - although that line does not occur in the film.The bottom line is: if you are a conservative Christian, then you will probably enjoy this movie or at least find it interesting.

You just have to let Kirk take you on a ride.It's only when we read too much into things - if that's Kirk's real sister, why isn't the brother-in-law played by the real brother? Where's Candace Cameron, his somewhat of a bigger star sister, and her husband, hockey player Valeri Bure? Why was there no hot chocolate in Kirk's mug in the overly earnest open? Does anyone who made this movie not realize that the DeAndre character is racist in its depiction of black people? Is anyone mad that they co-opted dubstep? Why wasn't POD in this movie?That said, I'm not going to make fun of Kirk for being a child star or his earnestly vacant stare. Obviously, this was not a movie made for me.

With a little livelier pacing and some editing (to remove the pregnant pauses), the message could have been presented in 45 minutes. I did not go into this movie thinking it would be a comedy, so I wasn't disappointed. However, the comic relief presented was a little strained and contrived.There is, actually, very little acting. The descriptive parts frame a number of vignettes that illustrate what is being discussed. In between different themes, a party is going on. Some of the party sequences made little sense. There is one sequence where two coworkers are talking behind coffee cups (presumably to keep from being seen on video discussing things at work) which has absolutely nothing to do with moving the story and, mercifully, is never addressed again until the out-takes.That having been said, I came away with some information that I did not know or had never thought about before seeing the movie. I believe the message should be heard by Christians and, thankfully, it is aimed directly at Christians. I don't feel like I wasted my time in the movie, but I feel like it could have been presented more evenly.

Moreover, better to specify God the son as having become human.\nSanta Claus (Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas)) is depicted as an angry (orthodox) bishop beating the hell out of the heretic Arius at the C4 Council of Nicea: poetic amplification from a medieval folk-tale of Bishop Nicholas trying to slap some sense into a follower of Arius. In reality, Nicea probably had more freedom of speech than the BBC, really wished to hear Arius and other ideas, and probably Bp. Nicholas wasn't there.\nAn interesting take on Christmas trees as linking Genesis to Golgotha.\nArguably the film drags a fair bit (keep going at least the first 5 minutes), but some good acting and good fun sustains it, plus its invitation to at least rethink what the Christmas event really meant and means, even if we don't buy Kirk's take. Particulars aside, Kirk's generalisation is valid: instead of knocking the accrued tinsel of Christmas, see how they can point to deeper reality, but don't go singing to Christmas trees.

Too many contemporary \"Christmas\" movies claim that the true meaning of Christmas is \"family\" or \"finding your true love.\" Nice, safe sentiments to be sure, but not the \"true meaning of Christmas.\"Did the makers of \"Saving Christmas\" get everything right? Far from it! Would I watch it again? Nope. Would I recommend it to anyone else? Probably only to fundamentalist Christian friends. But it is not deserving of all the hate and the (currently) 1.5 rating. This movie is definitely not for everyone. However, there are certainly more awful and unwatchable movies out there.",

Half the movie is \"go nowhere exposition.\" The first 15 or whatever minutes is just Kirk talking to the camera talking about why he likes Christmas. It tries to be well shot, but it's just boring. Then there's like 15 minutes of \"family Christmas party scene.\" Again, very boring, and also kind of poorly shot, with bad lens flairs and camera angles. Oh, and after the brother has a change of heart about Christmas, he starts a \"Christmas music rap band\" with some of the most cringy and grating dancing and singing I've ever seen in a \"professional\" work.But with all this bad, when Kirk is talking about the religious significance behind the nativity, Christmas tree, and Santa, it's REALLY good. I knew the stories behind the nativity, Christmas tree, and Santa, but Kirk shed an entirely new light on them, and I won't look at them the same again. Plus, it's really well written, shot, and entertaining.When it's good it's really good, but when it's bad it's really bad. Kirk should forget about \"feature length\" and instead should make short films about religious symbols.",

Yes the plot was limited, but hey, so are the plots of many very enjoyable entertaining flicks:) It had enough plot to be interesting and enough endearing holiday garb and jingle to boost my holiday season. I am amazed at the emotion ....and sheer LENGTH (college term paper length) of some of the very inaccurate wildly neg reviews. These folks obviously are 'activisting' not 'movie reviewing' or they wouldn't be so emotional; but rather they would be doing a shorter 'matter of fact' review,....like is normal:)I saw Saving Christmas at the 'Egyptian' theater at Arundel Mills mall on Dec 15th. My son went with my husband and I. It was ridiculous that the movie was so hard to find. We drove 30 min to see it:)...because we heard it was really good and represented our heart on Christmas. Regardless of ones view on that matter, there is nothing to despise and attack about this light hearted beautiful film. It is great,exceptional acting (which surprised me). It was really well written and put together from start to finish. Anybody badly bashing this film in an unusually lengthy manner,is simply on a lib activist rant and should be refraining from showing that ulterior nonprofessional motive so obviously:) Mr. Cameron came up with a very good quality film with a well chosen cast. It was a highlight of our Christmas this year and it deserved to be in more theaters! I hope he initiates another film for next Christmas, I would be in the front of the line going in:)",

I would not go to the cinema to watch it, but viewed with family I think it can open very good conversations, especially with children. It definitely does not deserve a one star rating.

I understand the real meaning behind so the Christmas traditions, like Santa and the Christmas tree (they're not based in materialism).

The message of celebrating Christmas instead of getting so wrapped up in the arguments over certain details of the celebration I think was lost on a lot of people, given how many people rated it low based on particular details of his description of the holiday. There were parts of it that I felt he was \"reaching with\" as well (particularly his explanation of the Christmas tree) but a lot of other thoughts that were very thought provoking to me (his take on the birth of). Besides, I personally love hearing other people's opinions and beliefs. =)) To me, the worst parts of the movie were the \"lecture style\" intro and the dance scene in it...but again, the movie itself I thought was very thoughtful and thought provoking, and I personally LOVED the \"Celebrate Christmas\" message it contained. The script was well written and the acting surpassed most independent films (which people tend to forget it was).Basically, if you're not the type of person to say \"It's Kirk Cameron, I'm going to hate it\", then it's more than worth watching, if you are that type of person, then definitely don't waste your time. It's someone of strong faith using his artistic ability to spread his beliefs to anyone who wants to hear his message, and based on that fact I give it a 10. It's not a message that's popular in our culture, and especially not popular in secular Hollywood.",
