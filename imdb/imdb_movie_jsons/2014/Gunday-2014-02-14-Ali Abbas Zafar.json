            "content": "The movie was probably aimed at being on of those a masala flicks with bromance, romance, song sequences, tragic background and what not. But half an hour into the movie and it all went for a toss due to a very very weak script. The on screen appearances of the actors was good but it wasn't really backed by any actual acting.The dialogues were over cheesy and ludicrous in all aspects. Probably Priyanka Chopra was the only watchable element of the movie (or may be I am being biased).Frankly an hour into the movie and i really felt like leaving (I don't know why i didn't). Trust me guys, its one of those movies which is meant to be forgotten and if you haven't watched it and are planning to, then forget the time and money that you are going to waste on this and just save yourself from the agony that might scar you.The only way this movie could be watchable is with a group of friends who are making fun of everything possible whilst the movie plays.",

            "review_title": "Could the movie be THAT bad?!",
            "content": "As many of my readers have probably noticed, I have a strange affinity for bad films. Sure, I also enjoy foreign, independent and classic Hollywood films--but sometimes I enjoy a film so awesomely bad that it makes me laugh. Because of this, I periodically peruse IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 List to see which films are the lowest rated films of all time. And, aside from a few foreign language pictures which aren't available in the US, I have done a pretty good job of finding and watching these turkeys. A few of these incredibly low rated films are actually not that bad, though most are truly terrible--and many of also unintentionally funny--and these are my favorites. Birdemic, Prince of Space and Eegah are particularly funny examples from the list.Imagine my surprise recently when I noticed something VERY unusual. A new film managed to not only make the list but vault all the way to #1. Coming from out of nowhere is the Indian film Gunday--a 2014 offering from director/writer Ali Abbas Zafar. And, considering my recent articles for Influx about my love for Indian movies as well as for bad films, I realized that this was a definite must-see. After all, if I praised Bollywood movies for their fun and originality, I have some obligation to mention the bad along with the good. So I wondered, since the movie is ranked as the worst film of all time on IMDb, is it really THAT bad?! Is the movie worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space or is it a case where folks are jumping all over a film that really isn't THAT bad (such is the case with Glitter or Gigli)? When Gunday began, I could see that it was completely unlike most of the Bottom 100. Most of these films are ultra-cheap films with tiny budgets and few were ever considered prestige films. However, Gunday clearly is a big-budget Bollywood film--with all the trappings you'd expect from such a film. It has handsome actors, huge song and dance numbers and tons of style. The story is about two orphans who grew up in war-torn Bangladesh, Bikram and Bala. The two are starving and so gravitating towards a life of crime is understandable--and this sort of plot is VERY common in Indian films. They are in some ways like Robin Hood--big-time mobsters who have a heart for the poor and are their benefactors. Because of this and their toughness, no one would ever consider testifying against them and they have become the top crime lords in Calcutta. However, a policeman (the exceptionally talented Irrfan Khan) has made it his job to take down these criminals. And, in addition, the partner's strong bromance is threatened by a pretty young lady who both of them have fallen for big time. The first portion of the film which shows the pair as children is actually very good. It is a compelling story and you feel for them as kids. They face hunger, sexual abuse and many other obstacles and the audience naturally pulls for them--even though they do begin engaging in criminal activities in order to survive. A bit later, however, the film jumps way ahead in time. Now the pair (played by Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor) are grown up and are becoming the top criminals in the city. They also have become incredibly silly--with extremely well-coiffed hair, rakish good looks, shirts ALWAYS strategically unbuttoned and STYLE, STYLE, STYLE! In fact, they look much more like models in a Vidal Sassoon advertisement than mobsters! And, to make it worse, they act much like Sacha Baron Cohen in Br\u00fcno or Ben Stiller in Zooolander-- though these two American films were intended as comedies, not dramatic musicals like Gunday! It's a strange contrast to see their terrible performances alongside Irrfan Khan--who, as usual, is terrific. Now I am not saying that Singh and Kapoor will always be bad actors--but the sorts of performances the director elicited from them are absolutely terrible. Does all this bad acting and nonsense rise to the level of awfulness that merits the film being on the Bottom 100 List? Not really. While the film is pretty dumb at times (mostly, I feel due to the direction and performances by Singh and Kapoor), the film does have a few things going for it. The songs are terrific and catchy. Zafar can direct music videos--just not people acting like real people. And, as I mentioned above, Irrfan Khan is excellent in his role and this Indian actor has been getting a lot of well deserved attention in breakout films like Slumdog Millionaire, The Lunchbox and Life of Pi. Plus, parts of the story are interesting (though historically inaccurate)-- though I must admit that the film certainly does become tiresome after a while.So why is this poor but not terrible film rated #1 in the badness scale? I can only assume because it was so well publicized, marketed and designed to be a mega-blockbuster. Like the examples I gave above (Gigli and Glitter), this is a case where the public really LOVES getting on the bandwagon to trash a mega-film. But unlike these two films, Gunday actually made a ton of money...yet people hated it! Perhaps this makes this movie the one that Indians love to hate! All I know is that if Zafar can make more 'failures' like this one, he'll become an incredibly rich man!!By the way, if you're curious and would like to see the list, it's available at http://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom?ref_=nv_sr_1",

            "content": "The one area where Bollywood has achieved excellence and perfection is publicity / promotion. The art of pre release promotion has taught them how to sell their even average / substandard productions at good profits. The much awaited, hyped and promoted \"Gunday\" is finally out in the theaters and yet again, net result is \"Total Disappointment\". The movie from head to toe lacks attraction in any field (Story, Music, Direction & even Acting).The handsome combo of Ranvir and Kapoor proved insufficient. Irfan Khan selected a B Grade movie and disappointed his fans. PC is continuously on the way to destruction with another flop appearance. The charisma of YRF and embodied cast could not bring desired results. Although film may achieve a good business (May touch the magical Figure of 100 Crores Club)but it can not be termed a movie to watch. The idea of late 80s once again failed. It is a wake up call. I mean how long audience can be fooled by exaggerated promos and publicity. At last, it will fall. So Wake Up!!!!",

Does the director understand that this project has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done this film.At the very beginning of your film,they are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think their script writer was plastered while writing the script. If their information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? India joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. India didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. Director can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. they showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in their film. It's tremendously humiliating for us (All Bangladeshis).3.According this story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!",

Very poor costume selection as we can see the film is plotted on 1971  but their costume is more like 90's. For example Priyanka chopra  maintain tied fitting shirt & pant for the movie. That was ridiculous  !! Ha Ha Ha During 1971 How can a lady police wear that kind of props  LOl :p I afraid during that time was their any lady police (in  sub-continent) ? :/ How could people make this kind of junk!!   Bangladeshi fight for their country  and gain glorious victory during 1971. It was a war between Bangladesh  & India. Not India-Pakistan war.",

Indian government helped Bangladeshi government in every aspects.They gave food, medical support and guerilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they working with something like this.",

In this movie they humiliated and twitched the history of the freedom war of their neighboring country called Bangladesh. In the war of 1971 Bangladesh fought a bloody war against the Pakistani Armies for 9 months to achieve their freedom. 3 Million people died. two hundred thousand woman got raped. Pakistan was both Bangladesh and India's common enemy. That's why to save their own skin, they helped the Bangladeshi's to achieve freedom.",

This is not the real history of our Liberation War of 1971. The total contribution and all credits of our freedom and Victory in the War of Independence in 1971 goes to the Freedom fighters and real patriotic people of this country. General people of Bangladesh also rendered a huge selfless contribution with food, clothes, money, treatments and medicines as well as shelters and utmost inspirations to the freedom fighters. India has given finishing touch and did nothing in this war, but traded with Pakistan as a bastard broker. The real history is that our Freedom Fighters and patriotic people had to directly fight in the war with the Bastard Pakistani forces. Bangladesh has a glorious history that we had obtained/earned our freedom by a bloodshed War. There is NO nation in the whole world which has such a great history of Victory. Indian Army had not to fight with the Paki bloody swines. Basically, both the nations India and Pakistan got No independence, but they got their country Donated by British bastards. The 2 Bastards came from a Bastard. I think there may be conspiracy of the Collaborators of the then War of 1971, \"Jamat e Islami Bangladesh\" and \"Jamat-e Islami Inida\", \"Jamat-e Islami Pakistan\", \"Shibirs\", \"Rajakars\" and Pakistan with the making of such film with the Director and writers of the story. I do also believe that Ali Abbas Zafar and Sanjay Masoom may be \"Paki\" swines from their family background or they born from the urine of \"Paki\" bastard \"foujis\". They may be Pakistani \"jasus\", and both may be agents of ISI. They might have connections with Terrorists (\"atankbadi\"). Indian citizenship should be canceled from both of them.",

You probably are getting great response for your new film Gunday in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your visitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.",

The Bangladesh Liberation War(Bengali:Muktijuddho) was a revolutionary independence war in South Asia during 1971 which witnessed the birth of the modern state of Bangladesh. The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali \"Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al- Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta. India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II.",

The songs are catchy and very good in particular Mun Kunto Maula and Tune Mari EntriyanTowards the end of the movie you are struggling as to whether they should get away or get caught such is the manner in which there acting and the life they have led in the movie draws you in.

            "content": "Once again a movie that was worth waiting as everything about it was superb. For me it was the ultimate action movie to see Arjun Kapoor of Ishaqzaade fame who has that intensity in his eyes and Ranveer Singh in an excellent phase of his career with Irrfan Khan who always selects his roles in movies according to the script. Add to all these the superb music of Sohail Sen, who has pulled off a brilliant musical album.Set in 1971, Calcutta, two childhood friends Vikram & Bala fighting the odds where they were separated from each other in 1971 Bangladesh liberation, and then gradually developing to local Gundeys as usual blaming the system and law for the same. The movie starts off in grand style with the enthusiastic Jashn-e-Ishqa which is shot lavishly. Priyanka Chopra also had an interesting introduction where she bumped into both the male leads in a gents toilet in a hilarious conversation which may sparkle some laughs. And also a beautiful scene in the fish market where some old songs were playing in the background was a good one. Irrfan Khan was casted as a superbly intelligent cop who was given the duty to bring Vikram and Bala to terms. But he relied more on other factors to break Vikram & Bala's unity rather than his intelligence, helplessly, which can't be disclosed as it will reveal the twist of the plot.The major problem with \"Gunday\" is haphazard writing with some predictable twists which we have seen regularly. The characters were written in such idiotic style they never had a feel of themselves in the story. Both the Gundays were just busy showing their romancing skills with Priyanka and between themselves which lacked the spark.I mean to say you will not fear them as Gundays they were more so like jokers. Remember a scene in Gangs Of Wasseypur where the character Faisal Khan cut off the head of his friend and hung it outside his house to invoke fear in the minds of people and to show that he has arrived.That was a different master class movie after all and this is a commercial one but no instances of cruelty was shown by the Gundays, so that we could believe that they are the real Gundays.Irrfan Khan in a short role has done the best work as usual but it is still hard to understand why did he signed the movie as he is very selective in his approach? In the climax scene where he asks Arjun Kapoor to surrender really the direction couldn't even spare him from looking awful.The story never grips you as an audience and therefore the movie appears long and boring. Direction by Ali Abbas Zaffar is extremely ordinary, and shall compete with Vijay Krishna Acharya's Dhoom 3 for the worst direction. Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor have some sort of chemistry between them but that is not enough for a 2hr 34minute long movie. Also add to it a disgusting scene where Priyanka Chopra dances in front of the single screen theater to Sridevi's Mr India movie song which invokes a fight between Arjun Kapoor and one of the side actors. Gunday had everything in it's favor a superb promo, foot tapping music, excellent star cast, solid dialogs but it unfortunately suffered with it's messy direction.Tons and tons of slow motion action scenes makes you restless in your seats.I wonder the fabulous dialogs would have worked like a magical spell if only the movie had some substance in it. This movie could have been so much better if at all some research had been done in making a better scripted film, but that was not the case. Dialogues like these would create some whistles, clapping and superb song sequences will make a time pass but that does not even make the movie an average watch. Go in with standard expectation yet there is a chance you may come out disappointed, and of course that will depend on your personal choices.. Irrespective of what the movie is but Arjun Kapoor and Ranveer Singh both have acted well and surely to look out for in the near future..",

            "content": "The first sequence that comes in this movie is pretty surprising. It defies every possible facts about the birth of Bangladesh. It was never a war between India and Pakistan. It was a liberation war, and it was fought by our brave people. It was a huge resistance we admire to our heart. We always welcome and remember India for helping us during war, but it never deny the facts nor accept the fiction war between two other countries.I never see Indian movies because they are always low par on quality. They always throw something on the mud to start a movie hoping that it'll find along its way. I never had the intention to see this movie but this time they throw something on the mud that is very important to me. I can only say to the director of the movie is if you need to make a 3rd grade chick flick movie don't put serious staff on it. Why bring liberation war ? your movie is about dancing around and hanging around and doing stupid staff anyway !",

            "content": "There is a tale in the Mahabharata, of two demons, Sunda and Upasunda, who had got a boon from Brahma that they could not be defeated so long they were fighting together. Soon they vanquished the devas , and conquered all three worlds. Knowing force could not defeat them, the devas used their cunning, and sent their prettiest apsara, Tilottama to seduce them. Moment the demons set their eyes on her they expressed their desire to make her the queen, to which she said she could belong to only one. Both the demons were desperate to possess her, and started fighting. Being evenly matched, they both killed each other, and the worlds were saved.A version of this above story is perhaps the most clich\u00e9d of all gangster flicks, and Gunday after-all is as generic as its name. It is a throwback to 70's era films, whether it was Amitabh Bachchan here in Bollywood or Chang Cheh directed Shaw Brother kung-fu epics, with a plot where brotherhood and honor triumphed everything else. Punchy one-liners, relentless background scores, heroes with hearts of gold, heroines that switch between cabarets and guns with ridiculous ease, and the \"system\"\" as an omnipresent villain complete the homage. Young Bala and Bikram are mistreated refugees from the 1971 Bangladesh war, struggling to survive. A career in crime beckons, starting with gun running, and then graduating to kingpin status in the coal mafia world. Speaking of running, both Ranveer and Arjun do that a lot in Baywatch fashion- slow motion, cleavage baring, with an orgasmic grin in tow, which even puts Pamela Anderson and Alexandra Paul to shame. They are not rebels, just criminals without any particular justification. But of course they are not bad people, so they run charities and schools. Their notoriety puts them in the cross-hairs of top cop Satyajeet Sarkar, and in the absence of any real proof to arrest them, he sets upon them his version of Tilottama, who makes them dance to the tune of a few catchy numbers. The rest is as predictable as its can get.Ranveer and Arjun ham hysterically all the way through. Their bromance is the central theme, and here they are pretty much inconsistent. Even though they are mafia kings, they have never seem to have grown up. Arjun Kapoor's psychotic streak was especially unbearable. Priyanka Chopra does another typical Priyanka Chopra role- looks mighty good and drapes a sari as well as anyone, ups the ante in a few dramatic scenes. Irfaan Khan shows how a class actor can still earn his paycheck in a masala movie without diluting acting capabilities.Deewar, Kaala Patthar, Sholay, Don, Mr. India, Dostana, Yaadon Ki Baraat- every scene in Gunday is copied from one past movie or the other. Director Abbas Ali Zafar's only drop of originality was the setting- Kolkata. So everything that signifies Bengali for the outside world features here-the Howrah bridge, Durga Puja, fish market, football, Dakshineshwar temple, but their presence does nothing to the story, they are just props in an utterly predictable movie. And in the end that is what Gunday is- filled with style but bereft of any originality and humor, with cardboard cut out characters, and insipid storytelling. 100 crores? Sure thing. But who cares? 4/10",

But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes in the film.1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your support didn't give birth to Bangladesh, rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us.3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!We consider the mistakes in the film to be unintended. Therefore, do not only apologize to us BUT CORRECT the mistakes. Thank you",

            "content": "The actual reason behind this is that Bengali Muslims cant bear the fact that a 'kafir' Hindu army saved them from their own Pakistani Muslim brothers. Would Bangladeshis here answer a simple question - \"who did the Pakistani army surrender to in 1971?\" Was it a Bengali Muslim? or to an Indian army general? If India didn't defeat and create Bangladesh, why did the Pakistanis surrender to Indian army in dhaka and not to the rag-tag 'mukti-vahini'. Wasn't Mukti-Vahini anyway armed and created by Indian support anyway? Bengali Muslims, even though butchered by Pakistanis in 1971, still hate Hindus more than they hate pakistanis, they continue to massacre and rape Hindu minority in their country which owes its very existence to India. Since 1971, Bangladeshis have managed to reduce their Hindu minorities from 20% to 7%. By down rating this movie are Bangladeshi Muslims just trying to hide their guilt over genociding Hindus since 1971?",

            "content": "At first I never understood why the movie was getting rated down so badly. Looking at the IMDb reviews I though i wouldn't want to see the movie. But the songs of this movie has always been one of my favorites - kunto maula, gunday title track. ITs when I started reading the reviews I really understand where these low ratings are coming from. Its rated 1 start by mostly those Bangladeshis who do not agree with the story of the movie. I understand they may not relate to the story but then if one was to rate the movie on its story I would rate it 8/10 and acting will fetch 7.5/10 but the climax of the movie is what really made me cry. Through out the movie I was slowly drawn into the close bonds the two lead characters share on the screen. It makes you cry at the end. Then climax is full 'paisa vasool' worth the money. It have seen the climax at least 10 - 15 times. Its when the movie ends you make sense out of the story, background narration by the two gundays makes it worth a worth second time. Don't go by the 1/10 rating these Bangladeshis have given because it shows how much Bangladeshis would like to be a part of this nation called Indian out of which they were born. 1 start rating is not due to bad story or bad acting but because it deeply hurts a Bangladeshis ego / sentiments. I have always considered Bangladeshis as brothers but then after all during 1947 they (as a part of Pakistan) had decided to part from India on the basis of religion - such stupids are difficult to find anywhere in the world.",

Still i thought it would not be appropriate for me to use harsher words. but yes 3 millions of Bangladeshi people were killed and 200 thousand of the girls were raped. and people fought for their motherland. just for the sake of cheap publicity you shouldn't have done that. Indians were their beside us, but we fought for 8 and a half months before you started fighting yourselves.

As a Bangladeshi, I am not denying the fact that India helped us a lot that time, but its my right to protest against the proper manipulation of a country's birth history!

All together the Bengali people fought for 9 months against Pakistani army and made their motherland an independent sovereign country with the sacrifice of 3 million lives.It is a historical, world wide recognised fact that Bangladesh is the only country in the world's history which is liberated by it's people for their freedom of language. This movie misrepresented the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. It is a disrespect towards Bangladesh and its people. The movie director Ali Abbas Zafar, producer Yash Raj Films should have taken the correct history of the Bangladesh Liberation War 1971 into their consideration before attempting this movie. When a movie is made based on any historical event, sincerity, preciseness and correct context must be taken into consideration. People associated with the making of this movie shown negligence and carelessness which is unacceptable. The viewers should not trust the storyline of this movie. It is an untruthful movie.

            "content": "This film dishes up emotions like drugs, and if anyone is addicted to such stuff he's sure to enjoy this flick. It has the unbreakable friendship bond, enmity, betrayal, courage, emotions and above all four excellent performances in Ranveer, Arjun, Irrfan and Priyanka. I'm a big time anti-Arjun, but I think even he did really well here in this film.Of course, the story and the plot may not be something entirely new or extraordinary, but the films doesn't go dull even for a moment. However, let's touch upon the controversial aspect of this film:1. It shows of India mistreating Bangladeshi refugees. It offended some Indians I read.Then we move onto the two biggest controversial parts of it, the third being the one that caused protests!2. It shows that, for no apparent reasons, Bangladeshis consider themselves Indians. This is best seen in the scene where they kill that man on the train and shout out at him \"How are they to be blamed for having been born on the other side of the border? How does it make you any better Indian for having born on this side?\" Absolutely cringe-worthy patriotism propaganda!3. In its very introductory few minutes, Bangladesh's independence is portrayed as a by-product of an Indo-Pak war. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the reason why this film ends up as the worst- rated film on IMDb thanks to the mass voting by the Bangladeshis - a campaign that was kind of officially led by some organisation of theirs on social media; and I totally understand their sentiment. Maybe I would've understood their objection to it better had I myself been a Bangladeshi, because they take great pride in their struggle for liberation and the number of people who lost lives for them.But I would think beyond those introductory notes read by Irrfan the first few minutes and rate it as a film based on its own story, film-making and performances. As a fan of Ranveer, I fully enjoyed this emotion-fest, complemented by three wonderful songs, especially that soulful Qawwaali. I can watch it any day and enjoy it all over again!",

Bangladesi people were a little outraged with the script's emphasis of Indian and downplay of Bangladesi contribution in the Indo-Pak war. Bangladesh and India each appeared in this ode to Kolkatta's plight. Factual evidence could have been clearly subject to bias for the target audience, yet the entertainment factor had been the main draw.

This movie insulted & sullied the image of Bangladesh in every possible way and it even fabricated a new degrading war history of Bangladesh. In the beginning, the narrator says: Bangladesh is the result of an Indo-Pak war but the truth is: This war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Liberation Army), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-planned air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II.The Bangladeshis are very proud of their war history because they fought and earned their independence.

But the truth is it was an war between Bangladesh (the then East Pakistan) and Pakistan (the then West Pakistan).

            "content": "...than watch this seemingly absurd, sheepishly long flick having 3 main characters and 1 special appearance where the latter does a more meaningful part than the main actors.First of all, I still can't understand why Irrfan Khan's appearance has to be quoted as a \"cameo\" when he shares at least 20 minutes of screen space. Secondly, what were the writers thinking while authoring the twist in this film? The twist is so feeble, a 10 year old sitting beside me guessed it right.Starting off with a childhood story about two friends who later become partners in crime, Gunday tells the story of how a woman can wreck havoc in friendship. But, after making this point, the plot fidgets. The twist actually smears the whole thingy with glittering banality. Love breaks friendship! Okay! That's cool! But why did you have to bring up a twist and re-frame the whole goddamn thing? That love did not break friendship. Why?Arjun Kapoor's last stint in Aurangzeb was appreciable and it was one of the best movies of 2013. But, he overstates himself here, maybe due to the competition with ever charming Ranveer Singh. The latter does a better performance and has a better character, so to speak. Priyanka Chopra is a cabaret dancer, yet she tries to instill good values in other characters and request to stop the indecent act. Lame!Irrfan Khan is the only appreciable person, but his dialog delivery is poor. Maybe, it all has to do something with the extremely unprofessional direction. The cinematography is fine, but why so many slow-motion shots? Music is fine, but 6 songs aren't too much?At the end, what was a relieving climax also is turned into another long, slow-motion scene which culminates to dramedy. Every single factor of the movie is unoriginal, not to mention how during almost all the dialog delivery, the poor direction shows up like a spinach leaf on your teeth after dinner. Many scenes involves discontinuity wherein we expect the scene to end with a short conclusion, but in we are shown a new sequence. This was particularly terrible.BOTTOM LINE: Last week's Hasee Toh Phasee told a better story. Gunday, due to its bad story, direction, screenplay & editing is just 3.4 out of 10. Even the two child actors couldn't entertain me. I chuckled maybe 3 or 4 times. But, the question is: is that enough?",

It wrongly claimed, the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971 gave birth to the country Bangladesh. Bangladesh was born through a nine-month long war, started from March 26. three million Bangladeshi people sacrificed their lives for freedom. it was always us, who started this war, sacrificed for it. India involved in the war on 3rd December, 1971. Of course, they helped us win over Pakistan. But, it doesn't mean the war belonged to them. India has no right to misinterpret our history, to describe our history on their own way.\" (nahid_du07 from Dhaka)2. \"Wikipedia says: \"The Bangladesh Liberation War (Bengali: \u09ae\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf\u09af\u09c1\u09a6\u09cd\u09a7 Muktijuddho) was a revolutionary independence war in South Asia during 1971 which witnessed the birth of the modern state of Bangladesh.[13] The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large- scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali: \u09ae\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09c0 \"Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities.Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.\"So stop ruining some countries history!!!\" (parisa_is_pooh from NY, USA)3. \"I will not deny that India did not help us in our liberation war in 1971. However, most of the help was done through indirect means- like giving shelter to refugees, helping in guerrilla training etc. But it was Bangladeshis who directly involved themselves in war. India took part directly in the war during the last month of the battle. That is why, the whole credit for winning the war should go to only Bangladeshi people. I strongly feel that the production house should apologize to Bangladesh for mocking our history in the movie. Shame on Yash Raj production!!\" (razzak-shishir from Canada)4. \"Do you piece of shits have any idea of the liberation war of Bangladesh took place in 1971...??? whatever came to mind, you guys just wrote without verifying the truth...just get to know the facts...real facts then write something...do you have any idea how many lives were lost in defending the motherland???you have got no idea. This damn film also humiliates the Bangladeshis. You have no right to humiliate any citizen of any sovereign country.This film portrayed that individuals of Bangladesh were engaged in various legal actions during the liberation war when in reality; they had been battling for the liberation of their motherland.Furthermore, the film awfully overstated the scenario in 1971 representing that the Bangladeshi used to discuss in Hindi! My foot! It's a issue of excellent disgrace when some foolish & insensitive scriptwriters represented the Bangladeshis as Hindi- Speaking Country, who are the only fearless nation who had reduce their bloods for declaring their native language returning in 1952! The whole world is now celebrating International Mother Language Day on 21st of February each year. This is not some kind of bloody joke. Get to know the reality first you damn scriptwriters.\" (Yo Yo Sing)",

They grew up to become the messiah for Calcutta people but their friendship is torn apart when they fall in love with a common girl. Directed by Ali Abbas Zafar who gave us light hearted Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Gunday is an action potboiler of 70's era where grand entry and punching dialogues by hero were welcomed with whistling and screaming in the theater. Zafar does fairly good job in keeping the audience alive but suffers from lackuster screenplay in the first half. The film boast off some high voltage drama but half baked romantic track spoils the mood. The second half picks up and will keep your attention till well executed climax. Few twist do add dome spice to the film. Art direction is ma gnus. Cinematography is outstanding. Songs are good. Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor pulls the film on their shoulder and will ensure you are entertained. Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan provides adequate support.

It also depicted a Bangladeshi Army Officer involved in Arms Smuggling to India and use children as sex slaves. This movie is a heresy and an insult to our country's history and our nation. I deeply condemn such deliberate misrepresentation of the history of Bangladesh and our people. The fact is, our struggle started from 1952. Though we are thankful for India's military intervention during the last stage of the war, but it does not give them the right to change the history of a nation which lost millions for independence.",

            "content": "GUNDAY is a crime film directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, starring Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Irfan Khan in the lead roles.The story revolves around two friends, Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor) who are refugees who get involved in the coal business, eventually becoming Calcutta's biggest 'gundas'.The marketing of Gunday was extremely good; the teaser, let alone the trailer, grabbed everyone's attention. The music was outstanding, the promos gave everyone the impression that the sizzling bromance between Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor could cause Gunday to be the next Sholay... or so we thought.Gunday starts off with the characters' backstory, which later dissolves as we are introduced to the adult versions of Bikram and Bala. Initially meant to be a crime story, we are introduced to the romantic side of Gunday as Priyanka Chopra's Nandita enters into the plot. Nevertheless, the film is unable to have a solid plot, and so the first half of the film doesn't quite live up to it's potential. As we enter the second half of the film, it tries its best to live up to all the hype its created but, unfortunately, fails to do so. The very script, as well as its characters, needs quite a bit of polishing; it would have made it a great movie (and even a possible cult classic). You could say that the director wasted a huge amount of time in the first half and started to rather cram everything he wanted into the second half. However, by the end of the film, I wanted to love it so much but its blatantly obvious that the film is a waste of potential, considering it had GREAT music, GREAT performers as well as GREAT location backdrops.The acting is first-class, to be honest. Ranveer Singh, is the best out of them all inspite of having Irfan Khan in the film. Singh handles his character with ease, and seems to be getting better with every film he does. Arjun Kapoor is great playing a gunda as well, however, he needs a bit of work in terms of emotions. Priyanka Chopra's role doesn't have much to it, therefore, its quite hard to judge whether she was necessary or not. Irfan Khan was great as usual. A special mention to the actors who play the young Bikram and Bala. They were fabulous and might just turn out to be splendid actors.The music was just MINDBLOWING. Every song from 'Jashn-E-Ishqa', 'Tune Maari Entriyaan' and 'Aasalam-E-Ishqum' to 'Jiya', 'Saiyaan' and 'Mann Kunto Maula' are just great. However, one of the noticeable flaws in the film is the fact that the director kept cramming every song at every nook and corner. And to be quite honest, inspite of Jiya being a great song, its as unnecessary as 'Dil Tu Hi Bata' Krrish 3.The dialogues are real good but its like Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobaara; no gangster ever cries out one-liners whenever he speaks. Nevertheless, both versions of Bikram and Bala say it with great macho that you actually quite enjoy it.The one thing that actually does quite live up to its hype is the Ranveer-Arjun bromance. Its quite entertaining at it contributes to one of the reasons why some of the film's flaws are forgiven.In conclusion, GUNDAY is over-hyped to make it seem like a must-watch Bollywood film, but in all honesty, its just a masala flick that's a great timepass, but by the time you realize that, you're so irritated at what a letdown the film actually is. If you want a great buddy film that has action, great one-liners, and some killer performances, then GUNDAY is your film. But don't go in expecting the best movie of the 2014 or a classic, because you are going to be extremely disappointed, just like I was.GUNDAY- 5/10",

            "content": "Gunday (Outlaws)A review by Dr Deena Padayachee.The trauma of orphaned children growing up in a predatory world is highlighted in this beautifully made production.Illiterate, and without families, the boys have to somehow survive; all they know are criminals; the good Samaritans are few and far between. They learn how to be criminals from other criminals. As one of them says, 'when we were little you did not give us books, you gave us guns.' (A hoodlum uses them as gun-runners) Central to the film is the heart warming comradeship between the lads as they help each other selflessly so that both might survive. The movie begins at the birth of Bangla Desh, after the war which freed the country from West Pakistan. Today, Bangla Desh is one of the poorest countries of the world but the boys escape to Calcutta, India where they eventually take over the underworld from the incumbents.But they are called 'refugees' time and again as xenophobia rears its ugly head - spewed by lilliputian, inadequate mindsThe great friendship between the two men (Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor) is undermined by their love of the same woman, played with flamboyant finesse by the gorgeous Priyanka Chopra.I loved the photographic technique employed, the thought and care that went into filming so many scenes and the wit and intelligence displayed in so much of the dialog.The police inspector, played with sinister professionalism by Irfan Khan would be so helpful to our local detectives as he infiltrates and undermines the gunday brilliantly. The acting is superb all round and the script is certainly not dull or boring. There are sinuous surprises and exquisite romantic moments to make this a film well worth seeing.",

            "content": "Watched \"GUNDAY\" \u2013 I heard somewhere that this movie is a tribute to Legendary Friendship movies of Bollywood like \"Sholay\", \"Kala pathhar\". Along with Multistar cast, Yash raj Banner, Heavy Promotions and not but least the director Ali Abbas Zafar (Who previously directed MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN) make \"Gunday\" a sure watch movie to me.The movie starts with a very promising note. It took you in the year 1971 when a new country was born named \"Bangladesh\" and also born a new group of people called \"refugee\". It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor).They faced war, struggled for food, saved themselves from a pedophile and ultimately managed to escape to Calcutta and here the story starts. During the struggle for their existence they understand that there is no straight path written for them and starting from stealing 20 kg of coal, the two friends grow up as the Biggest Mafia of Calcutta controlling the illegal trade of coal, timber and fish. This part of the movie is so high paced that it will automatically tighten your seat belt for the upcoming ones. As the movie goes on Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), the most beautiful mysterious (?)Cabaret dancer, walked into their lives. They both fell head over heels in love with her. Now Enters ACP Satyajeet Sarkar (Irrfan Khan), to counter force for Bikram and Bala. Besides, a hardcore and no-nonsense but still having a good sense of humor cop Satyajeet(Irrfan) is aware of the fact that 'United we stand, divided we fall' and is extremely happy to see that the Bikram and Bala have forgotten the ages-old maxim . But ACP doesn't know that they both are two bodies, one soul. After lots n lots of twists and revelations, the Gunday of this story, i.e., Bikram and Bala reach their inescapable destination.\"Gunday\" is a tribute to the Amitabh Bachchan style cinema of the seventies when the movies contained a proper story, good songs, superbbb dialoguebaji, attitudes, when the movies were action-packed and anger-packed terming the system as the villain which directed the innocent individuals on the wrong path. This movie is old wine in new bottle but this old wine renders a highly enjoyable kick to the consumer, i.e., the viewer. Action along with the Dialogue of the two heroes(in childhood as well as in the adulthood) is the best part of this movie. The first half proves damn engaging for the spectator. The story dips somewhat to some extent in the post-interval session but, the script-writer and the director brought it back on track and ended it with a high-octane climax in a coal-mine at Dhanbaad and the movie does not leave any sense of dissatisfaction in the viewer when they came out from hall saying \"pyaasa usul bhai\" or \"total masala yaar\" or \"superhit hai bhai\".Regarding acting it's a challenge to overcome each other in such a Multistar cast(Ranveer, Arjun, Priyanka and Irrfan) movie where every one is a very good actor .But without any doubt I want to say that Ranveer Singh steals the show completely from frame to frame. Priyanka Chopra is just like a sizzler in the menu card. If you are a boy (whether single or engaged or married or father of 2children),you cant close your eyes for a moment and cant time to look other co-actors in the song sequences where Priyanka is performing.On a whole a complete action packed masala movie you just loved to watch. As Friendship , Love, Betrayals(!) are on the air now on this valentines week this movie would surely be in your wish list.Take Home Massage: Don't Trust on a Bengali Person if he doesn't like or Play Football \uf04a",

Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your valuation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.",

The Full Story is just imaginary and mindless, historically false claims.

Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshies consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.",

            "content": "Surprisingly, most of the Indians know and believe that the liberation war of Bangladesh back in 1971 is actually the 3rd war between India and Pakistan!!! This is how they are even taught in their school's history books!!! They call it \"Indo- Pakistan war of 1971\". GUNDAY is NOT just another arbitrary example. This Hindi movie wanted to portray the same thought most of the Indians have in their mind about the history of the bloody birth of a nation. The people of Bangladesh fought for their freedom against the tyrannical Pakistan for 9 months. Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing 20000 innocent Bangladeshi civilians in just one night. Official name for that operation was 'Operation Search Light'. Bangladesh declared independence the very next morning. During this war 3000000 Bangladeshi gave their lives and 300000 women were raped by Pakistani army and their Bangladeshi Allied Forces (Jamate Islam, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami Chatrashangha). It was a war between Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian government helped the people of Bangladesh in every aspect during the war. This is what every friendly neighbor does in a war state of a country. They gave shelter, food, medical support and guerrilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi Freedom Fighters). Pakistan military launched preemptive air strikes on 11 Indian airbases on 3rd December 1971, and that's when India directly joined in the war. The Joint Force then fought for 13 days and finally Bangladesh got victory over Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Pakistani Army Commander Lt. General Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of Indian Chief of Army General Jagjit Singh Aurora and Bangladeshi Chief of Army General Osmani at Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. How Did India come to the equation that the war was between East and West Pakistan, India was only a sidekick who was on side of Bangladesh. If Indians claim 1971 war was Indo-Pakistan war, then it was also Pakistan-Russian war because Russia helped Bangladesh, or US-Russia war because US helped Pakistan. So when you watch this film, don't take everything you see seriously because Indians have a serious problem of taking credits from Bangladesh's struggle. I feel pity for that nation who doesn't know how to respect another country's history.",

About 3 million people died in this war. Indian army did what for us? They came at the end of the war for sake of peace keeping. Inside truth, they were only supporting themselves. Because if Pakistan divides into two pieces then it will be more easy for them to control or war between these divided countries. Don't make fun about our liberation war.Bangladesh Liberation War.... ------------------------------ The Bangladesh Liberation War was a revolutionary independence war in South Asia during 1971 which witnessed the birth of the modern state of Bangladesh. The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (\"Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias, engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta. India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre- emptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defenses soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II.",

This film is a great entertainer and you know that. Bollywood is one place where you should put in no brains because that is only going to bring headache to you and will make no difference to the film-makers. The film has already been declared a \"hit\" and the producer and director and actors are happy with it. Please don't make it #1 in the \"Bottom 100\" category. It does not deserve that. As far as the script is concerned, the film does have flaws and is almost predictable but the attitude and the energy the leading duo brings is mind-blowing. And the climax has such an amazing twist and unpredictability too. That's what makes it worth it. The first half of the film has some really good comic moments. You know it, the film is technically very sound. there are some really powerful moments that get your heart pumping. But there also are a few clich\u00e9s like the costumes of PRIYANKA CHOPRA and a few locations that don't look like 70's or 80's. As far as the performances are concerned, they are top-notch. RANVEER brings his usual \"mardaangi\" with himself and delivers his career's second best performance. His screen presence and charm is thoroughly felt. ARJUN gives us his best performance after a little dip in AURANGZEB. The two also have good comic timing. PRIYANKA is back with an eye catching sparkle after a few disastrous outings like ZANJEER. IRRFAN needs no words. He is simply magnetic. All in all, ignore that manipulation of history and what you get is entertainment, entertainment, entertainment, all thanks to the attitude, attitude and attitude of the leading men. It's an 8 for the film, 1 for the leading duo and 1 for the technical brilliance and climax. That makes it 10. But being fare, I'd like to deduct a star for that tweaking of the 1971 war. So that makes it a 9 on 10. No offence intended to anyone. It's simply my opinion.",

It's opening narration is set in Kolkata in 1971, and mentions that \"Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War\". The film also apparently indicates that Bangladeshis were involved in various crimes like arms smuggling, and two young boys from these lands escaped and became vicious criminals. There's also insinuation that Bangladeshis prefer identifying themselves as Indians. So this movie will create confusion among the people and it should be listed as a controversial movie and should be banned...",

It refers our liberation war as India Pakistan 3rd war which is totally wrong anyone can dug the history and check it out.Bangladeshi people fought for their independents in 1971. It was a war between Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian government helped Bangladeshi government in every aspects. They gave food, medical support and guerilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they working with something like this. from a production house like Yashraj we don't expect incidences like this. they are making films from a very long time its totally unexpected from them. please look into the matter......we are admirer of your movies so please don't let us down with this incidence.....",

But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes in the film.1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your support didn't give birth to Bangladesh, rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us.3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in the film to be unintended. Therefore, do not only apologize to us BUT CORRECT the mistakes.Thank you",

Nevertheless, the film hits a hard punch and delivers well. Gunday being a Yash Raj banner film, with young talent such as Ranveer and Arjun, the ever dependable and beautiful Priyanka, and the powerful Irfan Khan in lead roles, you'd expect this film to be a hit. Being a Bengali myself, I loved seeing some memorable locations around Kolkata (then Calcutta) city. Every scene in Gunday is powerful and the whole film rides on the bromance of Arjun and Ranveer. They are both brilliant and their friendship off the screen has made it so easy for them to portray this on screen. Ranveer Singh is just too good! The guy just oozes quality and style in every single scene he delivers. His chemistry with Priyanka is awesome too and I hope to see them paired together in more films in the future. Arjun Kapoor has arrived! This may be his third film, but I feel he'll be really noticed now and it will certainly open up to bigger and better roles. Arjun is perfect as the hot headed Bala, with fantastic screen presence alongside Ranveer. Ranveer is the lead, it's quite clear to see that but Arjun matches him step for step!Priyanka Chopra delivers a typical Priyanka performance - She looks stunning, she acts with ease, she romances so comfortably so such a role is probably very natural to her. She is certainly one of the top female leads right now in the industry and performances like these will always help her stay here. Irfan Khan will always be one of the most underrated actors in the industry, but he never fails to give his best. He is too good as the ACP and I'd love to see him in more cop roles in the future.Another big plus of the film is it's music. I was a little shocked that considering the film is very Bengali, why Pritam wasn't chosen but Sohail Sen has done a fantastic job. My favourite songs are Jashn-e- Ishq, Jiya and Gunday (title track), but all the other songs are excellent. Overall Gunday is a action packed masala film but unfortunately due to one mistake, it will not get the high numbers it should get.",

You probably are getting great response for your new film Gunday in India. But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India- Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.",

            "content": "YRF's latest entertainer Gunday is an unabashed ode to the masala flicks of the 70's - resonating the same sentiments of Yash chopra's potboilers - Deewar, Kaala Patthar, Trishul etc, which created the popular anti- hero as the by-product of the rotten system.Writer/Director Ali Abbas Zaffar sets his plot against the backdrop of Calcutta of 80's by giving a historical context of the war-torn Bangaldesh where two orphan Indian boys Bikram(Ranveer Singh) and Bala(Arjun Kapoor)find themselves on the other side of the border.Helplessness and Hunger turn them into gun couriers and soon they escape to Calcutta forging an unshakable bondage of friendship.Zafar unleashes their transformation into the city's most influential Gundey where the gigantic Howrah bridge witnesses the duo's array of illegal trade ranging from coal to timber to fish.Messiah for the poor,they have heart of gold but deep down inside they also harbor the angst of being refugees and yearn for acceptance.They are inseparable until they fall for the svelte cabaret dancer,Nandita(Priyanka Chopra).Naturally, there is a bitter clash - Friends turn Foes.Enter ACP Satyajit(Irrfan Khan) who must put a full-stop to their business and operate like a stealth chess player by crafting an elaborate ruse.Slick in its narration, Gunday has all the essential ingredients of a typical Bollywood entertainer.Lots of action, well-sculpted torsos, heavy dialogue-baazi,vibrant background score and of course, a twist in the tale.Its visually lustrous, thanks to the DoP that captures the riot of colors, the Puja and the Pandals and the dark mines of Dhanbad with gusto.Coal almost becomes a character with umpteen references to something dark,irreverent.Sohail Sen's music is commendable,the energetic soundtracks 'Jashn-e-Ishqa' and 'Entiryan' invigorate the proceedings while 'Mann Kunto Maula' regales with a sufiyana touch.What makes Gunday a watchable fare is the zesty verve of its leading men.It proves a point - there is definitely something more than just brawn and biceps.Both Ranveer and Arjun infuse life into the characters with raw swagger and 'tevar'(attitude).While Ranveer sincerely lends emotional depth to Bikram, Arjun endows vulnerability and grey shades to the hot-headed Bala. Irrfan , with his pithy dialogues,is superb as the sarcastic cop while Priyanka provides the glam quotient.There is the immensely talented and likable Saurabh Shukla who brings stability in both the boys and the narrative.Don't go with high expectations , it might not permeate into your cerebrum but you will have a gala time of amusement.Rating : 3/5",

You can say it was an attempt from a \"big\" production house to make a movie. But the video failed from the very beginning when it tried to twist the history of a nation's independence i.e. Bangladesh's glorious history.Just because you are one of the biggest production house in a country, it doesn't allow you to twist any country's history. I watched the whole video, just to make sure if there were any further references to Our(Bangladeshi) history. but believe me it was one of the painful experiences of my life. I had to skip a few parts for it was being too much for my nerves.Last of all , I would like the producers to change the controversial part and then release it. Or, if they are prudent enough, they should stop showing the movie for it will save them the humiliation of producing the worst \"attempt to make movie\".",

The Film Portrays Bangladesh really badly, In 1971 Despite War, Bangladesh was Richer than India in terms of Wealth (World Bank), In Terms of GDP Per Capita. The Full Story is just imaginary and mindless, historically false claims.

There is something called art ,there is something called history which have to be co-learned with art in schools . educate yourself before making a film.if you want to make picture about '71's refugee see the footage of those refugee camps,see the footage of Dhaka city in '71.no one fancy that.this film is a total insult to all Bengali people including those who fled to India after 1947, who died during the liberation War,to all Bangladeshi .",

How Did India Come to Equation, The War was between East and West Pakistan, India was only a sidekick who Was On Side Of Bangladesh, If Indians Claim 1971 war was India - pak war, then it was also Pak - Russian war because Russia helped Bangladesh, or US - Russia war because US helped Pakistan. The Film Portrays Bangladesh really badly, In 1971 Despite War, Bangladesh was Richer than India in terms of Wealth (World Bank), In Terms of GDP Per Capita. The Full Story is just imaginary and mindless, historically false claims. The director should have at least shown a disclaimer or something in the beginning because the film is not based on real event, The film portrays Bangladesh as the guilty one. So When You Watch This Film Don't take Everything You See Seriously because Indians have a serious Problem of Taking Credits from Someone Else' Struggle. War Between Bangladesh And Pakistan in not an Indo - Pak war,To All Indians, Please stop Manipulating History of BangladeshLet's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes.",

However, what Zafar fails miserably is the weak storytelling. I didn't expect this kind of direction from a potential director who gave us a wonderful film like Mere Brother Ki Dulhan. Talking about the performances, I liked Ranveer Singh a lot. He has this innate charm which draws the audience to him. The boy proves himself yet again as Bikram, an interesting character but totally let down by a weak direction. Arjun Kapoor is good too, however I don't think he can give more facial expressions apart from giving an impish smile or an evil grin. Priyanka Chopra does her part well, especially in the cabaret number. She looked hot in some of the songs. Irrfan Khan excels in a not-exactly-a-cameo role. However, his dialogues could have been better since he is a master of that art. Gunday suffers from weak direction, poor dialogue, slow editing and poor story. I expected a much better movie from a director of Ali Zafar's calibre. I give it 7/10.",

India contributed to our liberation war a few days before our independence when the results could already be predicted at that time. hence making a movie out of such a false, misleading storyline is nothing but a display of mockery to the 300,000 lives the Bangladeshis lost. The soul purpose of a movie is to portray true facts/events/history and \"entertainment\" is just a mere ancillary.

The Liberation War of 1971 was between Bangladesh (East Pakistan that time) and Pakistan (West Pakistan that time), not between India and Pakistan. India engaged in the war when Pakistan attacked India at the very last moment of the war. Yes, it is true that without India's help it was almost impossible for Bangladesh to win the war but that doesn't mean that the whole credit goes to India alone. So, whatever this movie showed is actually a shear lie. Now the movie has been released, there is nothing Yashraj films can do to reconcile it. Apology is not enough since it was not an unintentional mistake. It was a deliberate attempt to undermine the sentiment of Bangladeshi people which is an unforgivable crime. Yashraj films you're busted. Playing with the emotion of 3 million martyrs is not reconcilable by any means. Only hate may give solace to the people of Bangladesh.

Gunday, although not falling under the genre of my preference, let me be unbiased in reviewing the same. The movie begins at the backdrop of 1971 war, where Bangladesh as a country was born. It gave birth to lot of orphans and refugees. Gunday is about two young orphans Bikram and Bala who witnessed the war and its aftermath. Refugee camp turned out to be a hell rather than a shelter for them, where the seeds of gunday was sown. Fighting for survival, the inseparable duo escaped to Calcutta (now Kolkatta). The young Bikram and Bala enacted by Darshan Gurjar and Jayesh V Kardak reminded me of Salim Malik \u2013 Jamal Malik (played by Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar) of slumdog millionaire. Both Darshan and Jayesh have given fabulous performance.The grown up Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor) with their illegal business (they have justification for all these) started ruling Calcutta and became its most loved, most celebrated, most reckless, most fearless, and most powerful ... Gunday! There comes the entry of gorgeous Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), a cabaret dancer who swept both Bikram and Bala off their feet. There are certain light moments when both Bikram and Bala try to woo Nandita turn by turn. I wish, these moments could have been prolonged a little more. Nandita has given some sensuous performance through dance sequences. Although her costumes don't belong to 80's era of fashion. Irrfan Khan as ACP Satyajeet Sarkar has definitely added his style, cool, composure to the character. He plans to trap them and the movie moves ahead to let us know whether and how Bikram, Bala get trapped in that. Irrfan is also the narrator. Music by Sohail Sen is good. Irshad Kamil has penned down some good lyrics. Cinematography by Aseem Mishra highlights Hoogly, Howra Bridge, fish market the specialties of Calcutta. Director Ali Abbas Zafar has definitely tried to take out the best from Ranveer and Arjun, although I felt Arjun's expressions betrayed his dialogues at times. I need to mention that I missed the director Ali Abbas Zafar of Mere Brother ki Dulhan fame in this movie. Saurabh Shukla is natural and effortless as always. It is disheartening that Gunday has nothing new to offer. Very predictable plot. Watch Gunday only for Ranveer & Arjun's chemistry, Irrfan's tactful cop act and Priyanka's dance numbers.",

They gave food, medical support and guerrilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they working with something like this",

I surely felt that this movie is a waste of time. I don't know how the script writer and the producer went ahead with this script. Its a real shame. As a Bangladeshi this twisted history really has given me a creep as I was wondering to myself where are we going with our history twisted like this. What was the main reason behind this wrong history representation? was it really intentional or just the script writer,director,producer are not educated enough!!!",

Childhood of the lead characters are well established in a very interesting way. Scenes are also fresh till this time but when Irffan Khan been introduced on screen, suddenly movie starts loosing its grip. Movie becomes slow and somehow predictable. Crux of a cat mouse fight or chase looses its intelligence and thrill. There was no logic that why an honest DCP burns all old files of criminals and starts laying new trap? The slowest part of this movie is its forced love triangle. Interval is also not well justified. Climax is very lengthy just to show off blasts, fights and chase. Emotional quotient at climax is also not touching. Actually climax is the most dragging scene among the film. Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor are good. Childhood Vikram, played by Darshan Gurjar and young Bala played by Jayesh V. Kardak are fantastic. Nothing to do to Priyanka Chopda except some glamour requirement. Irffan Khan is very good. Saurav Shukla is fine. Music of the film is another dragging part. Whenever it comes, drags the movie.",

            "content": "Gunday(hooligans) is a movie whose story is set in the late eighties but it's absolutely a tribute to the Indian cinema of the seventies which shot Amitabh Bachchan to stardom making him the larger-than-life Angry Young Man. The story starts from the Indo-Pak war of 1971 which created Bangladesh. Two orphan children - Bikram(Darshan Gurjar) and Baala(Jayesh V. Kardak) struggled not only to survive but also to save themselves from the child-abuse of the corrupt militarymen around. Fate brought them to Calcutta and it's here that the real story of Gunday starts.These twosome understood that to fight against the odds and survive in the cruel world which labelled them as refugees and was not ready to embrace them, they had no option but to leave the straight path and take the twisted one making them as criminals. Starting from stealing 20 kg of coal, they grow up as the biggest mafia of Calcutta controlling the illegal trade of coal, timber and fish. It's their daredevilry which fetches them heavy dividends. Bikram(Ranveer Singh) is more mature whereas Baala(Arjun Kapoor) is easy-to-provoke. But both are two bodies, one soul as far as the outside world is concerned until there comes the twist in the tale.Enters a mysterious cabaret dancer - Nandita(Priyanka Chopra) which finally succeeds in dividing this inseparable twosome. Besides, a hardcore and no-nonsense but still having a good sense of humour, cop Satyajeet(Irrfan) is also on their trail and is extremely happy to see that the Bikram and Baala have forgotten the ages-old maxim -'United we stand, divided we fall'. After some twists and revelations, the Gunday of this story, i.e., Bikram and Bala reach their inescapable destination.As said earlier, this movie is a tribute to the Amitabh Bachchan style cinema of the seventies which was action-packed and anger-packed terming the system as the villain which directed the innocent individuals on the wrong path.Gunday is old wine in new bottle but this old wine renders a highly enjoyable kick to the consumer, i.e., the viewer. The first half proves damn engaging for the spectator. The story dips to some extent in the post-interval session but thank God, the script-writer and the director brought it back on track and ended it with a high-octane climax in a coal-mine at Dhanbaad reminding of the climax of Kaala Patthar(1979). Finally, the movie does not leave any sense of dissatisfaction in the viewer. It's a well made movie which adequately entertains despite certain flaws in the script and the presentation.The plot of a very old Hollywood movie Angels with Dirty Faces(1938) has been hackneyed by the Bollywood filmmakers to the hilt. Still they do not appear to be cloyed with that. Producer of this movie Aaditya Chopra(under the Yash Raj Films banner) had used this plot for his seemingly terrorism-based movie New York(2009) but he has again used it for the script of Gunday. The difference is where the plot of New York was directly based on that of Angels with Dirty Faces, here it's used only for the Priyanka Chopra track.Action alongwith the camaraderie of the two heroes(in childhood as well as in the adulthood) is the best part of this movie. It's the romantic track of Bikram(Ranveer) and Nandita(Priyanka) which irritates.Quite interestingly, Aaditya Chopra has cast Irrfan in a role which is identical to his role in New York. Well, he is a good actor who acts with a perfect body-language suiting his role. However his role is subdued here. Priyanka Chopra is a good actress and she has tried her level best to do well here too. But the trouble is that her character itself is no better than that of a cardboard cutout. Frankly, Saurabh Shukla has performed much better than these two. The child-artists playing the young Bikram and Baala are also very impressive in their act.Finally, the movie belongs to the heroes who are the true and dedicated Gunday whose(joint) conscience does not allow them to take the straight path. Both Arjun Kapoor and Ranveer Singh have excelled like anything. Dashing! Macho! Stylish! They are the heart-conquerors. The biggest USP of this movie is these two heroes only. They have complimented each other very well in the screen and make a terrific male-pair.Gunday is a praiseworthy effort and it's completely successful in its objective of entertaining the audience. As far as myself is concerned, I have already lost my heart to Arjun and Baala, the fearsome yet childlike innocent Angels with Dirty Faces or Gunday, to be exact.",

We are brave enough to tackle our own war. India and their people should want pardon from us. We Bangladeshi will not give them the place to tell lie.

Basically, they are good boys and good deeds but one incident of stealing coal from a train changes their lives. They become the biggest coal mafia. Added to that, they fall in love with the same girl Nandita (priyanka). In comes ACP Satyajeet (irrfan) to nail them. What happens after that forms the rest.The director has come up with a familiar storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was good in parts. The dialogues were reasonable. The script was smooth but the screenplay made it lot better. The background score was good but not that effective while songs were okay. Cinematography was rich. Editing was not sharp during first half. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was excellent. Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor shoulder the film well and dominate. Priyanka Chopra was valuable and looked sexy.Irrfan Khan was powerful. Saurabh Shukla was superb. Others did their bit as required.The film per se doesn't have anything special and different to offer but it is the way the whole thing is packed which entertains. The makers cleverly chose a 70s backdrop. The first half was somewhat slow and takes time to pick up but the second half has enough twists and turns to keep the energy on. Overall, this is a film which will appeal to the commercial audience and mass masala seekers. 3/5*",

            "content": "At last, I found a well written bollywood film, watched the other day \"gunday\" meaning (the outlaws). Ali Abbas Zafar, the writer and director of the film, produced by Yash Raj Productions has really matured himself since his last film I saw\"meray brother ki dhulan\" meaning (the wife of my brother). There is a lot to say good about the film. The character archs are beautifully drawn, and the tone of the film is immediately set as the film begins. The story of two Bengali kids (fast friends) , Bikram and Bala, rendered homeless and orphans after the divide of Pakistan in 1971. They had nothing to eat and mean to earn, they run to the neighboring India as refugees. They are abused as refugees and are merely considered as filthy rats among the Indians. The city is Calcutta. To survive, they start to steal coal from the passing -by trains and soon they become dons of Calcutta. But because of them helping the poor,they are admired and loved by the entire city. Both are now grown up as men in their late 20's. We already is informed that Bala is a short-tempered guy while Bikram is a matured and sensible guy. Nandita, a cabaret dancer walk into their lives which we further get to know is a police inspector working for the Calcutta Police under Satyajeet Sarkar, ACP, especially appointed to arrest the outlaws for their unlawful businesses. Both of them fall in love with the so-called dancer but only to find out that she only loves Bikram. This breaks Bala's heart coupled with their newly appointed man (which later we discover works for the Calcutta Police but has his own agenda too, taking revenge of his brother, accidentally killed by the two outlaws), who triggers fire in Bala's heart against his friend Bikram. Bala blows Bikram's property which is left with him after they divided equally between them. This enrages Bikram and he comes in Bala's place and fights him out. Soon, they get to know that everything is planted by the police to get them separated and broken. Sarkar has almost finished with the job when the things turn in the favors of outlaws. In the end, both of them are killed while escaping the scene by the Police. Cinematography is great in the film with lust of music which to me is never up to the task. The plot has a few drawbacks, especially why the police officer Nandita when gets abducted by Bala shows mercy on him (she's isn't in love with the guy), why at this point she never unfolds her true identity? This is a weak point. I love the scene, when Nandita tells Bala that she only loves Bikram and she has no sympathies for him, he is left standing before a mirror merely looking at his soul. The other good scene is when the two outlaws fight with each other; a bird flies and vanishes away, immediately telling us what's coming next. Also, when at the festival, a ritual is performed of drowning god's idols in the water; we are intimated that something awful is coming next. Most of the dialogues make sense, not on the nose and have more meanings than the usual bollywood films. So, I would say \"very good\" to the writer who's also the director of the film. Keep the good work going.",

            "content": "This movie has absolutely nothing new to offer but mere reflection of  80's bollywood masala action thriller movies. The entire plot not only  reminds you of the period when Sholay kind of movies portraying  friendship and love but actually makes you feel you are watching the  old movie in Sony or Zee TV on some lazy Sundays.   Plot: The plot is about two inseparable friends who became outlaws  because of their circumstances. They undergo the usual friendship, love  towards the same girl and betrayal finally becoming enemies and  patching up in the end. The plot also offers you a lot of twists and  turns according to the director most of which we find it or judge it in  the first 30 mins of the movie.  Casting: Arjun and Ranveer as the lead heroes played their roles  perfectly as coal hustlers. Irfan Khan as the commissioner of police  was not used so well in the movie. Priyanka Chopra as the lead heroine  comes as the only pleasant element to watch on screen stuns us with her  versatile looks in songs and scenes. Particularly after the hot steamy  item no in Ramleela she comes this time with the Moulin Rouge style  Cabaret dance no Assalaam Ishqun which she brought the real oomph  factor. Another song Jiya showed her as the Goddess of beauty with the  different hues in her dressing. Both songs I can say Paisa vasool in  terms of visual and music.  The movie lags in so many aspects not one in particular. On the whole  we cannot take this film as a proper remake of 80's bollywood nor as a  new movie. It only leaves you with a nostalgic feeling of so many older  times.   Verdict: If you are a die-hard fan of Priyanka like me or a fan of  Ranveer try this flick for watching them on screen or else miss this  you won't regret.   -Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran bsiva84@gmail.com)",

War between Bangladesh and Pakistan in not an Indo - Pak war, To All Indians, Please stop Manipulating History of Bangladesh. I strongly protest and criticize the whole team behind making of this Indian film- from the director to the floor boy. Bangladeshi people fought for their independents in 1971. It was a war between Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian government helped Bangladeshi government in every aspect. They gave food, medical support and guerilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people fought for their independents for about 9 month. Yash Raj Films should apologize for the worst LIE they said about the Liberation War of Bangladesh.",

That's why we are not stopping ourselves from protesting and sending mails to Yashraj Films. We are demanding your apology from your core heart and this should not be in a less covered media. We know you are a film making giant and know how to make news. We demand apology from you calling on a press conference. And our second and related demand is withdrawal of your bull sheet garbling history telling of your film's first eleven minutes. You people told the incident as a fiction. But keep in mind that, it may be merely a fiction to you but it is our sacred history regarding our independence. We don't know what you are coming up with. But we will never tolerate any propaganda regarding our history and its vandalism. We will continue our protest if you are not apologizing. If you need any further help please contact us in given email address below. And for your information we are sending you the Surrender document of Pakistani army in 16 December 1971 as a proof of your misdeed.

The movie is engaging and realistic and will never let you take your eyes away from the screen for the whole period. You will feel emotional, deeply rooted to the story and you would be able to relate a few things about you life as well, specially when Priyanka Chopra arrives at the scene. A cute love story which takes the story away from all that fighting and action and gives the viewers a breather. Dialogues are well delivered by both the actors. Ranveer and Arjun have come a long way and has actually delivered great performances. Ranveer is specially always giving his 120% at the camera, very energetic and nice to watch on the other hand Arjun is this angry young man and always ready to fight. While watching the movie it actually reminded me of Sholay and the sets do actually give you that feel. Most of the movie is shot at Old Kolkata and still gives you a fresh feel. On the other hand the Coal mines of Dhanbad takes you to a dark world of Coal Mafia which still exists till this day. The songs are nice to hear, well choreographed. Gunday as a whole is a well made movie and definitely a blockbuster of 2014. It definitely lived up to its promise and will make the viewers happy while they come out of the theater. I have gone through some other reviews where I could see comments such as \" Poor Story \", but trust me nothing more could be done to make the script better. The director did not make it unrealistic which is the current trend now. So just go and watch it Yourself and I know you would love it..",

India should apology about their fault . THis is a worst movie ever in history :( . here is the few information about the war . The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali: \u09ae\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09c0 \"Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist[15][16] militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities.[17][18][19][20][21] Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre- emptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the war .",

Actors need to do script background checking. And Indians need to learn to give respect to their neighbors and not make movies which has no historical basis at all, rather it is a mockery in the face of history. To make it clear again like many reviewers, this movie portrays Bangladesh-Pakistan war in a away that it was India- Pakistan war which is not true. Pakistan was killing us, torturing us, torching us, raping us, and in the 9 month battle they tried to do every inhuman thing, we can still find bodies of killed people at that time from mass graves in different places of Bangladesh. Pakistan-Bangladesh has been in bad terms from 1945, that is when the British broke up the Indian subcontinent into two halves, Pakistan (comprising of East Pakistan the present Bangladesh and West Pakistan that is present Pakistan)and India. when in 1971 things got really bloody, messy and too much India helped us in the battle (also they had their reasons too, they are always in bad terms with Pakistan anyway!). One big reason we fought with Pakistan (apart from the fact that they broke our economical backbone by not allowing us in any business and many indecent things) was that they tried to rob us of our language Bangla, and tried to impose Urdu. This was one big reason for the language movement in 1952. We still remember that day on 21st February each year.For us Urdu and Hindi is the same, a foreign language which is not equal to Bangla. So please, know the real facts and make movies which does not portray wrong facts and that may cloud the mind of normal viewer's, who doesn't know the history. Maybe you don't have the history in your history book too!maybe there is something else! who knows!",

Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.",

            "content": "I was surprised to see a rating as low as 1.2 i was expecting at least 3 . Most of the reviews focus on historical inaccuracy and issue of Bangladesh, which are surely by Bangladeshi's themselves ill focus on the film side. Of course if the writer doesn't know history and just twists it to carry forward his narrative he must be spanked.But creatively the movie was doomed anyhow. The whole Bangladesh angle was unnecessary and waste of resources. They could have avoided telling the history , why not show them just as refugees , why give them dialogs like two nations fighting while the whole episode was entirely different. Coming to the plot, it was unconvincing from the start, the director doesn't show us anywhere how and when they become kolkatas biggest gunday. And there is nothing to justify it. The biggest let down was scene where they both fight their lungs out, rather then making the scene an emotional beat out , the fighting was dull and expressionless and audience doesn't sympathize once for any of the character. But its the end that clearly shows incapability of screenplay and direction. The whole context of them running from the police was based on one murder, that was the main reason , but when ranbir had found out that the man killed was not killed but a policemen the whole story fell on its knees. What follows next is totally fools act. In the end they have no reason to be afraid of or to run. But i guess by the end director was even more confused on how to end it and you can feel it in the end when he cannot decide what to do with the characters . If you direct next time Mr director better come up with a solid screenplay , for the time being you might have made 100cr, but it was totally not due to you but due to the fact it was yrf film and you had good actors and huge promotion, as far as film maker you have failed miserably.",

Now, half of Bangladesh has turned out en masse to shoot this film down on account of their perceptions of historical inaccuracies. I beg to differ on two counts: 1: this is not a historical documentary and 2. there are many sides and versions of history. I have friends that have had to flee B'desh in the immediate aftermath of the war, leaving everything behind, losing their relatives, as they were of the wrong religion. No one can say that this did not happen. Ask the scores of B;deshi refugees in India and they will collaborate whats portrayed in this film. So there are many views on the aftermath of the war, with truth in each view, as they all represent experiences of different people.",

Saying that, however, I enjoy watching mindless cinema if it entertains me and this is completely a masala film: Gunda should be viewed as a fictional mindless film. Gunday showed one non-fictional event at the beginning of the movie and it was the basis of some events to come in the film but I think that scene should be analyzed within the appropriate context and in no way, shape or form was this movie attempting to be \"non-fiction\".Most Bollywood fans watch Bollywood movies for themes such as cool dances and songs, extreme action scenes, romance, vengeance, comedy and friendship. This movies has every single genre attached to it and this was depicted on screen by four fabulous actors: Irfan Khan, Priyanka Chopra Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor. I loved this movie. This movie was a story of a young friendship that turns into a shared empire which collapses because of undercover spies and a love interest. The true friends become friends again in the end and this is a movie that should be watched with your closest friends.Priyanka looked stunning throughout, Arjun and Ranveer were pretty toned up, Irfan Khan is an impeccable actor, the child artists were extraordinary and Saurabh Shukla did his part really well.I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and I recommend everyone to go and watch it.",

And atlast when they found they can't control the bangalis any more they started killing them brutally on 25th march, 1971. The great Bangali nation took arms against the oppression and the war of independence started on 26th march, 1971. India joined the war after 9 months on 3rd December, 1971. We became independent on 16th of December that year. Of course the Indians helped our people by providing arms, training and shelter but it doesn't mean after this 42 years they would change the history of our country and ignore the sacrifices of our 30 lakhs martyred souls.

The war between Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan) and Pakistan (erstwhile West Pakistan) began on the early hours of 26th March 1971 and after 9 months of battling, the Pakistani forces surrendered admitting their defeat which lead to the formation of a sovereign country named Bangladesh. There were actually two forces on the side of Bangladesh: 1. The Liberation Force (Mukti Bahini), commanded by General M.A.G Osmani and comprised of Bangladeshi military and civilian personnel. 2. Friendly Force (Mitra Bahini), commanded by Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora and comprising of the members of Indian forces. During the period from March 1971 to November 1971, the war was solely fought by the \"Mukti Bahini\" under the command of General M.A.G Osmani. During this period,the Indian Forces mainly contributed through providing training to the civilian members of the Liberation Force (Mukti Bahini)at their various training centers located in India. The Indian Forces joined the battle field with the Liberation Force in Novermber 1971, only about a month before victory of the Mukti Bahini. This was never a war between India and Pakistan. India was just a part of the war being a friendly nation to us during the time. But unfortunately, this history was massively distorted in this movie. We, the Bangladeshis do obviously admit the unparalleled help and support we received from the Indians during our biggest crisis period and do express our full gratitude to them but we protest such distortion of history of the liberation war of Bangladesh in the movie \"GUNDAY\"",

I believe world knows clearly what was happened on that time in 1971. We had to fight with Pakistan for our right and freedom,Indeed on 16 December, 1971, head of Pakistani solder signed in the surrender paper to Orora, who was an Indian solder, but on that time it was a stupid politics has been played by India with us. The reality is from 26 March our mass people started to protect to the Pakistani solder even without knowing how to shoot by a gun, but it was a strong mental inspiration that, we need freedom, and 9 months until 6 December our mass people and few solders fight with Pakistani solders without taking world help, at 5th December Pakistan attacked to India some how, and 6th December there only some solder came to Bangladesh and joined to the war with our nation under the direction of Orora. But in this film they hide the true story and published as the war was held between India and Pakistan, even on that time Our country already got name \"Bangladesh\" instead of \"East Pakistan\". I don't know why the published this stupid thinking in a film, after this film our nation feel ashamed and got annoyed. Because, there are 3 million Bangladeshi has been killed and 0.2 million our girls has been raped and uncounted child has been killed also by Pakistani solders. We got our country by exchanging our Blood with Pakistan. It was not like that, Indian solder or India gifted us our motherland. I strongly protect for this stupid thinking and India should beg to us to pardon.",

It can be very entertaining to sit through a stylish and cool flick that packs its substance in small doses and a moderately coherent plot. But when the film is all style and no substance, then as an intelligent viewer who feels duped by the filmmakers, I'm compelled to draw the line. And that's exactly what \"Gunday\" is - all style, no substance, a complete absence of logic, glaring plot-holes, and factual errors that occur all too rampantly to be ignored.Priyanka just passes muster, Irfan has nothing much to do, and Arjun Kapoor is as usual a let down. Ranveer Singh's rustic gunday act is the only redeeming thin about this film, but it bears no consequence on the ultimately disastrous outcome of the movie.",

They showed a documentary video from 1971 and was telling the war was between India - Pakistan. How funny !! We Indian just helped the New Born Bangladesh which declared its Independence on 26th March of 1971. Along with Bangladeshi Mukti-Bahini our Indian Mitra-Bahini started war against Pakistan after Mrs. Gandhi supported Bangldesh as a new nation on 3rd December of 1971. So, how can you tell that Director's idea is totally a fiction not a history while it was saying in that film that \"The 3rd war between Hindustan - Pakistan have been ended and gave birth to a new nation\". What happened of those Half Millions of Raped women , 3 millions people who died ???",

Connected and unified through social networks, youths have been pressing Yash Raj Films -- one of the most illustrious production houses in the industry, that is behind the film -- to remove that part and apologies for tweaking history. Released on February 14 in India, the action crime-thriller's opening narration is set in Kolkata in 1971, and mentions that \"Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War\". The film also apparently indicates that Bangladeshis were involved in various crimes like arms smuggling, and two young boys from these lands escaped and became vicious criminals. There's also insinuation that Bangladeshis prefer identifying themselves as Indians. As the news spread over Facebook, Bangladeshi youth strongly condemned the matter, and shortly after, organized an online campaign, sending petitions to the films production house, and bringing the matter to notice of everyone on the Internet. The campaign plan includes e-mailing a protest letter to Yash Raj's official account, their vice president, as well as flooding the social media presences of the production house, and the film, on Facebook . The message politely and cordially addresses the Yash Raj authority, summarily pointing out that India joined Bangladesh's War of Liberation on December 3, 1971, whereas the war has been going on since March, and three million people were martyred. It also addresses the undermining of Bangladeshis in the story, and asks for an apology and change in certain parts of the film. A social campaign is also underway on micro-boggling platform Twitter, with the hash tag #GundayHumiliatedHistoryOfBangladesh. Although there has been no official response from Yash Raj Films, the film's producer Aditya Chopra or director Ali Abbas Zafar on the issue, synopses of the film online have been edited to mention that Bangladesh was born after the war of 1971, and the film's Wikipedia page very cautiously mentions there might be scope for a 'misunderstanding' regarding the historic facts. This may not have been the first time Bangladesh has been looked down on or portrayed negatively in a film overseas, but the youth of the country, fully aware of the power of the connectivity of social media and getting its patriotic voice heard -- driven as a result of an 'awakening of spirits' last year -- have made sure the matter does not go unnoticed.",

It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali: Liberation Army), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta. India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched PR- emotive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defense's soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II.",

This movie indicates that Bangladesh was independent over the war between India and Pakistan in 1971 which is completely false and unacceptable. In 1947 Pak- Bharot(India+Pakistan+Bangladesh) was separated into India and Pakistan when Bnagladesh was the Part of Pakistan called East Pakistan. After that Bengali nation of Bangladesh(East Pakistan)wanted to be separated from Pakistan and that issue was raised since 1952 as establishment of Bangla language as state language instead of Urdu language. From that time there was many protest against Pakistani government and in 1971 Bangladesh declare War against Pakistan and Bangladeshi army fight against Pakistan and and won the war after nine month fighting. Bangladesh paid the liberation war by giving over 3 millions of martyrs. During the war, many countries around the world including India was supporting Bangladesh by providing food, arms etc which was really helpful and especially the supports from India was unforgettable for Bangladeshi.

People see the language that Bangladeshis speak ads being wrongly showcased.I agree this is abusive on the part of direction, however the film is a mass movie and couldn't have been a success had it been picturized in real situations. Hindi language was used so that most people could understand what was being said. One must note, Gunday is not a history lesson. It is a simple (and heavily flawed) story of two boys who were nudged into the wrong direction because of the circumstances. The director kept the main storyline real to a great extent and kudos to the director on that note. Nobody questions the acting ability of any of the actor in the film. Though Ranveer Singh's dialog delivery is a bit incoherent.

It could be categorized as a fantasy movie, and you all know low quality fantasy movie is tough to tolerate, the full movie seems like a circus and actors/actresses were clowns in the circus. I couldn't effort two and half hour to watch this too much boring movie.If you see this movie, you will only waste your valuable time.",

They gave food, medical support and guerilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they are working with something like this.",

Connected and unified through social networks, youths have been pressing Yash Raj Films -- one of the most illustrious production houses in the industry, that is behind the film -- to remove that part and apologies for tweaking history. Released on February 14 in India, the action crime-thriller's opening narration is set in Kolkata in 1971, and mentions that \"Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War\". The film also apparently indicates that Bangladeshis were involved in various crimes like arms smuggling, and two young boys from these lands escaped and became vicious criminals. There's also insinuation that Bangladeshis prefer identifying themselves as Indians. As the news spread over Facebook, Bangladeshi youth strongly condemned the matter, and shortly after, organized an online campaign, sending petitions to the films production house, and bringing the matter to notice of everyone on the Internet. The campaign plan includes e-mailing a protest letter to Yash Raj's official account, their vice president, as well as flooding the social media presences of the production house, and the film, on Facebook . The message politely and cordially addresses the Yash Raj authority, summarily pointing out that India joined Bangladesh's War of Liberation on December 3, 1971, whereas the war has been going on since March, and three million people were martyred. It also addresses the undermining of Bangladeshis in the story, and asks for an apology and change in certain parts of the film. A social campaign is also underway on micro-blogging platform Twitter, with the hash tag #GundayHumiliatedHistoryOfBangladesh. Although there has been no official response from Yash Raj Films, the film's producer Aditya Chopra or director Ali Abbas Zafar on the issue, synopses of the film online have been edited to mention that Bangladesh was born after the war of 1971, and the film's Wikipedia page very cautiously mentions there might be scope for a 'misunderstanding' regarding the historic facts. This may not have been the first time Bangladesh has been looked down on or portrayed negatively in a film overseas, but the youth of the country, fully aware of the power of the connectivity of social media and getting its patriotic voice heard -- driven as a result of an 'awakening of spirits' last year -- have made sure the matter does not go unnoticed.",

I have seen my friends and colleagues were extremely angry and annoyed about the content of the movie that it has ignored the glorious liberation war of Bangladesh against Pakistan during 1971 and tried to put it as a war between Pakistan and India. First I thought I would watch the movie as Priyanka is a hot chick and perhaps I would see what they tried to say. Later on I started growing extreme annoyance about what they have done with the movie and the way they ignored real facts just by reading facebook statuses and movie reviews in newspapers. I realized I don't wanna watch this movie to see what they have said. I rather decided to share what I think despite their movie masti! When Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan, India never managed to beat Pakistan in a war, never ever! During 1971, when Pakistani Army started killing innocent Bangladeshis, the general mass stood up against those brutal animals that were then known as Pakistani Armies. We are grateful to Indian people and their government for the support extended to us during that period. But it was Bangladeshi general mass who have fought against Pakistani Army and beat them badly throughout the country. Pakistani armies got badly beaten and was about to lose the war. India for their own purpose stepped into the war during December of 1971 and India and Pakistan declared war against each other. It was an already won war and Bangladesh won the war against Pakistan with pride and dignity. All I want to say is that we are fine with Indian people and their government for their role during our war against Pakistan. However, Indian government should investigate and take proper action against the people who made this 'Gunday' movie right away for being so ignorant and being a total loser. They should do it for their own purpose so that we don't consider other Indians as stupid as those who were involved in this movie!",

By the way, Bangladeshis don't deny the great help from India. Yes, India fought the West-Pakistan by joining Bangladeshi freedom fighters. but remember, the war broke out in 26th March 1971 and India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defenses soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. So this was clearly not a \"INDO-PAK\" war. India entered the war in retaliation. But it is also very unfortunate that while the Indian government accepts this fact the \"Gunday\" film production has not corrected this serious issues proving that they mean it.

Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.",

This war was always known as the Bangladesh Liberation War (I know it because I belong from Calcutta, we call it here \"Bangladesher Muktijuddho\") and not as the Indo Pak war as bollywood would like to teach us. It is really wonderful to see that the people of Bangladesh do care about their history & are standing united against this film that has misrepresented facts. This is high time that filmmakers realise that when they make a film, they reach millions, they should not misrepresent facts & must not hurt the sentiments of people, be it from any country in the name of ignorance. This rating is fully deserved for this one severe, severe lapse on the part of the makers. Hope they learn from their mistakes.",

They gave food, medical support and guerilla training for 'Mukti Bahini' (Bangladeshi freedom fighters). Pakistani army started the war (25th march 1971, midnight) by killing Bangladeshi civilians, university students, teachers and every person they found on sight. Official name for that operation was 'Operation search light'. During this war 30, 00,000 Bangladeshi gave their life 3, 00,000 women (girls, kids, even pregnant) were raped by Pakistani army and there Bangladeshi allied force (Jamate Islam Bangladesh, Al-badar, Al-shams, Islami chatrashangha). Bangladesh become independent on 26th march 1971 and got victory against Pakistan on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people and Bangladeshi government fought for their independents for about 9 month. 3rd December 1971 Indian army started attacking Pakistani army with Bangladeshi army and Mukti bahini. Pakistani Army Commander in the Eastern Command, Lt. General A. A. K. Niazi, signed the Instrument of Surrender in front of General of Officer Commanding in Chief of India and Bangladesh Forces in the Eastern Theatre, Lt. General Jagjit Singh Aurora. (16th December, 1971) This movie started with some voice narration saying that it was the 3rd war between India vs. Pakistan. All I have to say it was our war, it was between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is and always will be our war for independents. India helped us and we will remember that favor on behalf of our ancestors. On the other hand Indian movie makers must study history when they working with something like this.",

The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people.The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali:Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defences soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War II.",

Rather their utmost trying was to keep India involved in to be superior to Bangladesh giving their name onto that war in the front side. Basically they tried to say that, that was a Civil war between Pakistan and India. Which is really a disgraceful lie. Except these, if you think it as an entertaining one, you will get nothing good out of it. Because the director seriously does not know how to direct a movie. And the story is too much irrational.",

I found it odd that there is a movie with a worse rating than Birdemic: Shock and Terror. I proceeded to open netflix to see if Gunday was there, and sure enough, it was. I watched the first hour of it and thought \"this movie isn't great but it isn't as bad as Birdemic\" My curiosity overwhelmed me so I decided to look at what the reviews said. It was at that point that I realized that most of the people that participated in the vote, were biased because the history was wrong. Most of the raters had voted 1/10 because they are incapable of not making a big deal over some incorrect info in the movie. And even though I don't believe the movie deserves its current rating, that doesn't mean I think the movie is Oscar-Material. I rated this a 4/10 because there's a lot wrong with this movie. It's easier to just list my problems with it.*there are 4 music numbers *whenever the main bad-guy has the spotlight, they use the same evil-ish guitar riff over and over again to the point where it's almost a punchline every time they play it *there is seemingly no reason behind half of the things the characters do *the Shyamalan twist where the girl both main characters love is a cop all along",

Story also fails severely to get out from Bollywood clich\u00e9. Seems like the director and the producer tried to cast star performers in the central characters to find a mean to get their invested money back. Acting of Priyanka Chopra and Ranveer Singh was so horrible that a child would lough at it. As usual Priyanka Chopra was very provocative in this movie. It seems very unlikely to me that producer will get his money back from this movie. One thing I got to admit that songs of this movie are very erotic. No doubt it's going to be the worst movie of Bollywood for the year 2014. In a nut shell this movie is not worth to watch.",

Bangladesh got victory against Pakistani army on 16th December 1971. Bangladeshi people fought for their independents for 9 months. 3rd December 1971 Indian army joined with Bangladeshi people and started attacking Pakistani army to foster the victory.

If it was not the extremely brave ordinary people of Bangladesh who decided to face the then strongest military forces under the guidance of Bangabandhu with sticks and simple airguns in front of those hi tech Pakistani military tanks and weapons, instead of waiting for some foreign forces to come and help them getting independence, this war would have never ended. India did help Bangladesh towards the end of the war but they had their own interest in it too. In no way this war can be called a war between India and Pakistan.

Connected and unified through social networks, youths have been pressing Yash Raj Films -- one of the most illustrious production houses in the industry, that is behind the film -- to remove that part and apologise for tweaking history.This may not have been the first time Bangladesh has been looked down on or portrayed negatively in a film overseas, but the youth of the country, fully aware of the power of the connectivity of social media and getting its patriotic voice heard -- driven as a result of an 'awakening of spirits' last year -- have made sure the matter does not go unnoticed.Released on February 14 in India, the action crime-thriller's opening narration is set in Kolkata in 1971, and mentions that \"Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War\". The film also apparently indicates that Bangladeshis were involved in various crimes like arms smuggling, and two young boys from these lands escaped and became vicious criminals.

            "content": "I hope people with much more EMOTIONAL: INTELLECT and Artistic eye can try and appreciate this gem of a movie- directed by Ali Abbas Zafar who after this made SUltan and Tiger Zinda Hai- two Blockbuster movies.\nThe movie stars Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor as two boys trying to scrap a living through the harsh realities of their childhood. The whole war situation ( which got this movie downvoted) takes about 3 minutes at the beginning.. to explain why these kids were orphans.\nI have absolutely loved the bromance shared by Ranveer and Arjun. Priyanka Chopra brings her sass to add to the love triangle 'pizzaz'. The story is basiucally about two boys trying to make a name for themselves and fighting for the same girl. But the lines are delivered with such humour and there are so many scenes that will leave you laughing at the silliness of it all, so that the dramatic portions won;t have time to overwhelm you.. well until towards the end.\nThe music is super catchy ! I have learned some of the songs although I do n ot speak Hindi or any related language.. I loved them ! The camera work, the costumes and set designs are also of great quality.. and somehow reminiscent - to my eye- of SHOLAY .. another great Indian movie with Amithab B.\nAll in all this movie was a throughly enjoyable ride.\nWatch for Ranveer Singh's tour der force when he was only 2-3 movies old.. the great chemistry he shares with both Arjun and Priyanka and the fight and dance scenes that are so Bollywood!.\nHope you have as much fun with this drama rom-com as I've had!",

We are asking you quit giving 'excuses' and correct the intro narrations ASAP as this is NOT a request. . ** Released on February 14 in India, the action crime-thriller's opening narration is set in Kolkata in 1971, and mentions that \"Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War\" (Indo-Pak????). The film also apparently indicates that Bangladeshis were involved in various crimes like arms smuggling, and two young boys from these lands escaped and became vicious criminals (yeah right!).",

The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of NINE months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people.The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini . which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces.",

That's why we are not stopping ourselves from protesting and sending mails to Yashraj Films. We are demanding your apology from your core heart and this should not be in a less covered media. We know you are a film making giant and know how to make news. We demand apology from you calling on a press conference. And our second and related demand is withdrawal of your bull sheet garbling history telling of your film's first eleven minutes. You people told the incident as a fiction.

Bangladesh Government also protested against it and sent messages to the Indian Government for banning the outclassed movie.

It's packed with action, emotions, friendship, drama and some terrific performances it is movie which takes you in the era of a 90s .......... good work by all the actors..after a long time watched a great movie. Gunday has all the trappings of a modern-day action epic. The film has solid performances, catchy numbers like Asalaam-E-Ishqum and Tune maari entriyaan and a story that makes equal room for emotion and social relevance. There's a lot to impress the average film viewer. Six packs, bulging muscles, seductive dances \u2013 all the cinematic material required to make an audience friendly hit. Ranveer and Arjun are the soul of this popcorn action flick. Their energy, their chemistry and their good looks are paisa vasool. While Arjun portrays his character at the edge of darkness with perfection, Ranveer steals the show with his textbook good guy with bad habits character. Not far behind is Priyanka Chopra. It's a sight to see her in a cabaret and then hold fort with the two heroes in dramatic scenes. It's a pity her clich\u00e9d character doesn't allow her to do more. Same goes for the phenomenally talented Irrfan. He plays the witty cop with the right amount of restraint. But he should have been given the chance to lock horns with the two leads in a direct duel. That would've elevated Gunday to the next level.",

And India declared war on Pakistan on 4th December.From the very first day of the declaration of independence , the Bangladeshi people fought the Pakistani Army with valiance.

I think it is done for debasing the great history of Bangladeshi liberation war. If any producer makes movie including Bangladeshi independence war he/she should study on the war. I think every concern people should boycott this movie. Bangladeshi liberation war is the beginning of a independent country name \"Bangladesh\". No one should make fun with this reality. If any person or country do that it will be their great mistake.",

But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes in the film.1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your support didn't give birth to Bangladesh, rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us.3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous!We consider the mistakes in the film to be unintended. Therefore, do not only apologize to us BUT CORRECT the mistakes. Thank you",

It was primarily a civil war between two parts of former state of Pakistan. This war was in fact the liberation war of Bangladesh which sparked in the Language movement in 21st February 1952. I don't deny the fat that India helped us during those crucial days in 1971 and our entire nation says thanks to them.

This movie should be immediately called off, and banned for any civilized society or country that ever walked on earth. I therefore, rated this movie 1/10 for poor storyline.

Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on the 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.",

In the same way, this dreadful film often humiliates the Bangladeshis, on several attractions. It portrayed that individuals of Bangladesh were engaged in various legal actions during the liberation war when in reality; they had been battling for the liberation of their motherland. Furthermore, the film awfully overstated the scenario in 1971 representing that the Bangladeshi used to discuss in Hindi! My foot! It's a issue of excellent disgrace when some foolish & insensitive scriptwriters represented the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Country, who are the only fearless nation who had reduce their bloods for declaring their native language returning in 1952! Such is the condition and size of traditionally inaccuracy and dumbness! Poor foolish ass YashRajFilms!!! Better begin promoting pinup publications on the road - I mean it!",

It is quite unacceptable for us to believe that one of the best movie production houses financed the film without knowing the real history of liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971. The film opens on two boys, name Bikram and Bala, who arrived as Bangladeshi refugees in India. They arrive at a refugee camp, filled with other Bangladeshi citizens. The two boys, along with a large group of people, start chasing a truck, which was throwing bread to the refugees. The boys trip in mud, and then become approached by a man, offering them food. The boys follow the man back and get fed, before the man asks them to do some work for them. With the promise of consistent meals, the boys accept. The man, with the name Lateef, teaches them how to smuggle guns to ordinary citizens in India, with Lateef working for another army officer. The army officer then says to Lateef to leave one of the boys, so the officer can use the child as a sex slave, or the army officer will use Lateef's daughter instead. Bikram offers to stay, whilst Lateef takes Bala. Bala asks Lateef to go back, but he says no, so Bala goes alone. Whilst the army officer is removing his clothes, Bala storms into the room with a gun and shoots the army officer. The boys flee, and find Lateef. He tells them to catch a train to Kolkata and gives them some money. The army officers then try and chase the boys, but Lateef holds them back and dies as one of the officers shoots him. So my question is how two refugee boys went to Indian to sell guns from Dhaka with an hour and also stole police gun from police who dressed like Bangladeshi police officers in India while passing through Bikram and Bala.",

It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali: \u09ae\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09c0 \"Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities.Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta.\"So stop ruining some countries history!!!",

All the world knows very well, Bangladesh was born by the bloody long nine month war with Pakistan. India was indeed a partner in this war with us. But only a PARTNER!

I cannot believe a responsible production house like yrf can make a movie with so little research and we the Bangladeshis had to shout out loud as they have totally distorted the history of our war of liberation! In the movie, it has been said that, the 1971 was war was the third Indo- pak war and Bangladesh was born as a result of that war between India and Pakistan, which is NOT true. On 25th march 1971 after the massacre on Bangladeshi people by the Pakistan army, the father of the nation sheikh mujibur rahman declared our independence on 26th march and then began our liberation war!Indian government and people helped us with food, training, arms, ammunition, treatment and sheltering our refugees! We can never deny that and we are always grateful for that kind help! But that really do not give Indians the right to say whatever they want about our bloody struggle, fabricating the truth! After almost nine months of battle between Bangladeshi Mukti Bahini and Pakistan army, on 3rd December 1971 India declared war against Pakistan and joined us! On 16th December pakistani army surrendered with 92000 soldiers to the Allied force of Bangladesh and India. We repeat, it was NOT an indo pak war in 1971 and Bangladesh is Not THE RESULT OF A WAR BETWEEN Pakistan AND India! IT WAS OUR OWN WAR AGAINST Pakistan Where India undoubtedly helped us! We had lost 3 million people and 2 lakh women were raped and tortured during this war! It was a planned genocide by pakistanis and we resisted, we fought for our independence! This independence has cost us a lot of lives and sacrifice, it is the history of our pride and we are extremely sensitive and particular about it! And again, Bangladesh is NOT a Hindi speaking nation, we speak in Bangla which is our mother tongue and again for which we had to sacrifice our lives in 1952! So be careful again while telling the history of another country, stop showing them in your movies if you don't know enough about it, do some study before that and never dare to disrespect another nation, specially Bangladesh! I don't know whether this was an act of ignorance or intentional humiliation from your side, whatever it was, we, the Bangladeshi people protest it and we demand an apology!",

Connected and unified through social networks, youths have been pressing Yash Raj Films -- one of the most illustrious production houses in the industry, that is behind the film -- to remove that part and apologize for tweaking history. Released on February 14 in India, the action crime-thriller's opening narration is set in Kolkata in 1971, and mentions that \"Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrender on December 16 at the end of the Indo-Pak War\". The film also apparently indicates that Bangladeshis were involved in various crimes like arms smuggling, and two young boys from these lands escaped and became vicious criminals. There's also insinuation that Bangladeshis prefer identifying themselves as Indians. As the news spread over Facebook, Bangladeshi youth strongly condemned the matter, and shortly after, organized an online campaign, sending petitions to the films production house, and bringing the matter to notice of everyone on the Internet. The campaign plan includes e-mailing a protest letter to Yash Raj's official account, their vice president, as well as flooding the social media presences of the production house, and the film, on Facebook . The message politely and cordially addresses the Yash Raj authority, summarily pointing out that India joined Bangladesh's War of Liberation on December 3, 1971, whereas the war has been going on since March, and three million people were martyred. It also addresses the undermining of Bangladeshis in the story, and asks for an apology and change in certain parts of the film.",

Either it has been done intentionally to exaggerate the whimsical Indian nationalism that is oppressive to its neighbors to hide that there is no unity among the nations of that country - or the historical garbling was out of ignorance; in either case the team #Gunday #YashrajFilms are bound to correct their mistake/crime against factual truth. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.",

But when it comes to Yash Raj films, I try to see the movie in the IMAX theater. I had great expectations with this movie since two of the young casts were been brought. I liked the songs a lot. But then again I was disappointed with the first 5 minutes of the movie where the voice over of Irfan khan mentioned about the history of Bangladesh and how it was formed. I think who ever did the background research of Bangladesh's history wasn't aware of the real facts and figures. The movie was entertaining but i felt like my neighbor stabbed my back without even knowing I felt. I don't know what will be the consequences after this but if possible, please try to fix the errors you made in this movie. This is not a matter of movie or story line, its about deliberately playing with all bangladeshi s' emotions and history.",

Excuse me! Are you daft? 30 million people died in 1971 Liberation war and the gravity of the SILLY story about historical distortion shouldn't annoy Bangladeshis?

And coward Pakistani military wanted to do a massive massacre of Bangladesh People so that they will never attempt to talk about seeking power in the Pakistan.

The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. India entered the war on 3rd December 1971, after Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on northern India. But till 3rd December, only Bangladeshi people were fighting back to the Pakistani soldiers. It wasn't a war between India and Pakistan, what they tried to say in this movie. Shame on you India...",

It is a comedy that depicts what happens when a man is introduced to his girlfriend's family for the first time. Long story short, this guy ends up getting himself into a world of trouble that he never expected. This movie is filled with amazing actors who truly make the film. First, Robert De Niro gives a legendary performance in this film and is absolutely hilarious. Ben Stiller as the male lead is his usual funny self. Finally, Owen Wilson is also good for a lot of laughs throughout the film, even though he is playing a supporting role. The casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint. As mentioned, during his first meeting with his girlfriend's family, Greg (Stiller) gets himself into sticky situations involving family pets, lies, family members, fires, and even sporting games. The problems he faces will have you in stitches. Additionally, you won't be able to help getting so into the movie, and you'll be on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen in the end. One of the best things about this movie is that it's so relatable. We all have those awkward moments (many of them having to do with our love lives) that make us cringe. Regardless of your embarrassing situation, Greg has probably gotten into something worse. You can't help but laugh hysterically at his expense. Finally, I love how in this film just when everything seems to finally be going right, it can turn around in an instant. Without giving too much away, there are so many times where you think that Greg is finally going to make a good impression but then ends up messing up all over again, sending you into inevitable fits of laughter. Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of laughs and a love story all rolled into one. If you're looking for a pick-me-up or to laugh hysterically, this is undoubtedly the movie for you.",

Furthermore, the movie awfully exaggerated the situation in 1971 portraying that the Bangladeshi used to talk in Hindi! My foot! It's a matter of great pity when some dumb & numb scriptwriters portrayed the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Nation, who are the only brave nation who had shed their bloods for claiming their mother tongue back in 1952!",

This movie like garbage deserves no star and so I don't understand how it got 2 points something. Priyanka, Ranaveer have come a long way and they should take an equal part of the blame. How do they don't know about '71?! Just because they are movie star, they do not have to pretend they are not supposed to check historic accuracy of their movie plot. Specially, Priyanka, as an international superstar, should know better than me. How about Bangladesh make a movie about 1947 with derogatory perspective on Indian value. Oh yeah! There will be war. I know. Respect begets respect. New generation India should stand up. Start learning history and be part of anti racist movement.

Similarly, this terrible film often humiliates the Bangladeshis, on several sights. It depicted that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war when in reality; they had been fighting for the liberation of their motherland. Furthermore, the movie awfully exaggerated the situation in 1971 portraying that the Bangladeshi used to talk in Hindi! My foot! It's a matter of great pity when some dumb & numb scriptwriters portrayed the Bangladeshis as Hindi-Speaking Nation, who are the only brave nation who had shed their bloods for claiming their mother tongue back in 1952!",

India helped us but that does not mean that it was IND- PAK war.. They joined us in November 1971 with their Armi after pak had decleared war against IND in that month.

Let's have a look at the mistakes done in your film. 1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your velitation didn't give birth to Bangladesh,rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us. 2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us. 3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in your film to be unintended. Therefore apologize to us and correct the mistakes. Or else we will have to take different action. Thank you.It seems YRF made a lame apology that the movie is fictional. The movie maybe fictional but the liberation war fought by our freedom fighters is true. Hence the least we will accept is giving a disclaimer at the start of the movie mentioning that the information given regarding the birth of Bangladeshi is not true. simply sorry !!!!!!!!!!!!!! it's not done. YRF should remove those controversial scenes from the movie & articulate their mistakes to the world.",

If this is the calibre of movies that we have come to expect from the YRF production house, they'd be better off making a Chinese movie featuring some chimps. Arjun, the frog kapoor, is better suited to sell 'channa' by the roadside while his counterpart Mr. Ranveer, the gaand, Singh should take up a Coolie's job. Priyanka, who is the only one that can act, chooses to play the usual hookerish roles but she's not bad as eye candy.Needless to say, I regret spending $1 on buying a pirated DVD of this POS..I may just as well have tossed my money into a deep, dark, bottomless abyss, which is where the producers and directors should be tossed into for subjecting viewers to this type of monkey spunk!Forget about historically misguided facts about Banladesh, this movie is just filth at every entertainment level. Save your money and your friends and families from being subject to this crap..go have a kulfi instead.",

How one could make a film without proper researching of a historical event which is highly sensitive.Well, one may argue that the film maker should give enough freedom and film like 'Gunday' and' the Bastard Child' are only movies and movies for the shake of movies. One should not have to worry or more sensitive about it.Hmm, you know, In America stories were written on the African people depicting them uncivilized and strange people. One such story writer was Adgar Ellan Barose. Through reading this kind of stories the western child would wish to see 'these strange African people'. Therefore those story about Africa and the East were not merely stories but a discourse, which will be termed as orientalist later by famous post-colonial theorist Edward Wadi Said.Hollywood would also release and is releasing hundreds of films which are propaganda film. Pearl Harbor, Hotel Rwanda can be good example of this. So don't think the film like Gunday is film for the shake of film. It is a propaganda and discourse, a powerful discourse to abase Bangladesh. The tendency is age old. In the past time the people of the other parts of the Indian subcontinent would see the the civilization of the eastern part of the Bengal delta as lower, uncultured and poor. You may also term it regional Orientalism.Regarding the story of the film Gunday: It is a very poor story and not well researched. The acting was also too bad. One can not keep his/her interest in the film after watching half an hour.",

The message being that at the beginning of the movie the main characters were against the partition of Bengal and India. The partition left them homeless, so they went against the system to fight back, and started to steal. But when problems had arisen between the characters they started fighting against each other. The solution to put an end to their problems was to partition their own property, money amongst themselves. The same wealth they had accumulated to fight against the system and the partition movement; was now being used to partition amongst them to solve their own problems. How Ironic. It can also be said that the characters had embraced the idea of partition towards the end of the movie which ultimately lead to their downfall. Overall, I don't think it matters if YRF got some or ALL facts wrong when making this movie, the takeaway message is that partition is never the best solution for a country when they are facing a civil unrest because countless lives are lost or displaced, as was the case with Bikram and Bala. If Bengalis feel offended from this movie, they should calm the **beep** down because firstly; this is a fictional movie, secondly; if you are complaining then clearly you did not understand the message this movie was trying to portray.",

The film also apparently indicates that Bangladeshis were involved in various crimes like arms smuggling, and two young boys from these lands escaped and became vicious criminals.

I do not want to rank this film because for me the film has got no story, no good dialogue and no skillful acting.",

Make films as much as you like, but don't bluff about anything you don't know.The Bangladesh Liberation War(Bengali: Muktijuddho) was a revolutionary independence war in South Asia during 1971 which witnessed the birth of the modern state of Bangladesh. The war pitted East Pakistan (later joined by India) against West Pakistan, and lasted over a duration of nine months. It witnessed large-scale atrocities, the exodus of 10 million refugees and the displacement of 30 million people. The war broke out on 26 March 1971, when the Pakistani Army launched a military operation called Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia and armed personnel, who were demanding that the Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, which were won by an eastern party, or to allow separation between East and West Pakistan. Bengali politicians and army officers announced the declaration of Bangladesh's independence in response to Operation Searchlight. Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians formed the Mukti Bahini (Bengali: \"Liberation Army\"), which engaged in guerrilla warfare against Pakistani forces. The Pakistan Army, in collusion with religious extremist militias (the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams), engaged in the systematic genocide and atrocities of Bengali civilians, particularly nationalists, intellectuals, youth and religious minorities. Neighbouring India provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Bengali nationalists, and the Bangladesh government-in-exile was set up in Calcutta. India entered the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched air strikes on northern India. Overwhelmed by two war fronts, Pakistani defense soon collapsed. On 16 December, the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India defeated Pakistan in the east. The subsequent surrender resulted in the largest number of prisoners-of-war since World War.You guys only came to help us just before our independence. You guys were good neighbors then. But now you guys are bluffing about our War of Liberation. So be careful about saying anything.",

But this film has started disaster in Bangladesh. Do you understand that this project of yours has humiliated the Bangladeshis? Hopefully the mistakes were done unintentionally. Let's have a look at the mistakes in the film.1.At the very beginning of your film,you are telling the viewers that it was an India-Pakistan war happened in 1971. I think your script writer was plastered while writing the script. If your information happens to be correct,what were our freedom fighters doing then? You joined the war on 3rd of December 1971. And the war started on 25th of March the same year. Your support didn't give birth to Bangladesh, rather the bloodshed of our 3 million martyrs did. You can not but correct the mistake and apologize to us.2.The story of the film humiliates us on several scenes. You showed that people of Bangladesh were involved in various criminal activities during the liberation war. Two lads of our country become thief and vicious criminal going to your land in your film. It's tremendously humiliating for us.3.According to your story,Bangladeshis consider themselves Indian. How humorous! They can do anything to get Indian citizenship. Extremely humorous! We consider the mistakes in the film to be unintended. Therefore, do not only apologize to us BUT CORRECT the mistakes.Thank you, Manzur",

India had just supported Bangladesh with ammunition and at the last phase of the war with some military support. Other than that it was the Bangladeshi Freedom Fighters did the main job in the war field. We lost 3 million people in the war. In the Scene where the Indian army was leaving, the narration says that both the boys were thinking about how much right was the creation of Bangladesh(I must say this was an intentional criticism by the director) Last but not the least: Bangladeshi boys speaking in \"HINDI\" (!!!!!) Overall it was a poor creation from a big production house like Yash Raj Films and all they tried to do this demoralize and demote Bangladesh and its people. The scriptwriter and director should have done much more homework before doing something with historical events. This film has hurt the emotions of millions of Bangladeshis, it is time for Yash Raj to correct the narration of the film if possible or else take it down from theaters, or else History would never forgive them.",

Bangladesh has achieved its freedom through the sacrifice of three million martyrs. The movie is an insult for those martyrs who gave their lives happily for our country. I will not deny that India did not help us in our liberation war in 1971. However, most of the help was done through indirect means- like giving shelter to refugees, helping in guerrilla training etc. But it was Bangladeshis who directly involved themselves in war.",

Review the tile found in this link: http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/india_1900_to_1947.htm Early in 1947, Atlee announced that Britain would leave India no later than June 1948. A new Viceroy was appointed \u2013 Lord Mountbatten \u2013 and he concluded that peace could only be achieved if partition was introduced. The Hindu Congress agreed with him. Mountbatten became convinced that any delay would increase violence and he pushed forward the date for Britain leaving India to August 1947.In August 1947, the Indian Independence Act was signed. This separated the Muslim majority areas (in the north-west and north-east regions of India) from India to create the independent state of Pakistan. This new state was split in two, the two parts being 1000 miles apart. The act was not easy to put into action.",
