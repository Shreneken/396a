            "content": "The orphan Samantha (Allison Miller) gets married with Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and they travel in honeymoon to Santo Domingo. In their last night in the Dominican Republic, the newlywed couple is invited by a taxi driver to go to a party in the outskirts of Santo Domingo. They drink too much and do not see that Sam is brought to a weird cult. They return to the United States and soon Sam discovers that she is pregnant. Along the pregnancy, Sam changes her behavior and becomes nervous and aggressive. On the night of the delivery, Zach witnesses weird events at home. \"Devil's Due\" is a lame and cheap movie that uses the same storyline of \"Rosemary's Baby\". This rip-off could have the title \"How to Destroy the Storyline of a Masterpiece with a Hand-held Camera and an Absurd Plot\". Sam and Zach accepting to go to a slum in an unknown country with a stranger are among the greatest stupidities of the cinema industry. The new doctor uses the office of Dr. J. Ludka and no receptionist or nurse notices. The house of Sam and Zach is completely destroyed in a calm neighborhood and no neighbor observes. The use of camera as if it were Zach is nonsense in most of the situations. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): \"O Herdeiro do Diabo\" (\"Devil's Due\")",

            "content": "Samantha and Zach get married. For their honeymoon, they went to visit the Dominican Republic. One night there, they were brought by their taxi driver to a mysterious place where they get drunk and drugged. Nevertheless, they still managed to get back home safe and sound. Not long after, Samantha finds out she was with child. From there, the further along the pregnancy Samantha got, the more bizarre and more violent behavior she would display. As she nears her due date, can Zach still do anything to avert the diabolical fate that seems to await his wife and baby?Like many current horror films, \"Devil's Due\" is told through camera footage. Aside from the cameras Zach and characters carried around, there was also footage from security cameras. The first thirty minutes were practically just needless wedding coverage. When it got around to telling the story, the pace was also quite slow. Mundane daily events like going to the supermarket or the obstetrician were punctuated by some disgusting or violent scenes which would have been a big deal had it happened in real life. Here, they happened, but there seemed to have been no consequences that follow their occurrence.The best moments of this film were those scenes showing Samantha's repulsive eating habits, her super-telekinetic powers, and her effect on Catholic priests. The rest of the film was unfortunately forgettable, all the way up to the predictable climax. 3/10.",

            "review_title": "Hand-held horror fare without pretensions.",
            "content": "\"Devil's Due\" follows a young newlywed couple who find out they're expecting a child after returning home from their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Shortly into the pregnancy, mother-to-be Allison begins having unusual symptoms, and it appears that she and her husband are being watched by some sort of secret society who are awaiting the birth of one of the \"many\" antichrists.Cleverly prefaced with scripture from John, \"Devil's Due\" sets out on a road oft-followed in the found footage sub genre of horror films, charting terrorized couples and Satanic magic wreaking havoc on suburbia. That said, the film has a few interesting aspects; first off, it's not really a \"found footage\" film. Although much of the narrative is dispensed through home video footage which is recorded by the couple themselves, the film also utilizes surveillance footage from public spaces as well as the cameras secretly placed in their home to help tell the story. In other words, it is not a film claiming to be a \"true story\" \"discovered\" as a cohesive piece of found footage. It's in all actuality a fairly standard horror movie that is told through the medium of hand-held video and surveillance without the claims of being real or \"found\", and for that, I found the film mildly refreshing. I roll my eyes every time I see a found footage horror film claiming to be reality (\"The Devil Inside\" comes to mind), but \"Devil's Due\" makes no bones about anything of the sort, and in that sense is very much aware of itself and doesn't rest solely on its pretensions.Secondly, I can't not praise the acting in this film. The other downfall of most \"found footage\" films is that they star unknown actors who often have little experience and/or talent, and thus tend to have less-than-stellar acting, which just cheapens films that are already cheap to begin with. That's not the case with \"Devil's Due\". Zach Gilford plays the concerned husband role both behind and in front of the camera, and is convincing in the role; however, Allison Miller is the one who really carries the film. Her performance in this was wonderful in general, and especially wonderful in a film of this type. Very naturalistic and totally believable. My praise even goes for the minor roles; all of the acting in the film does feel genuine, which really elevates this above other hand-held horror fare.Narratively, the film is definitely imperfect. Some people have claimed the film is boring, which, while it does take time to get going, the slow burn nature of it allows for some subtle scares to creep in over an extended period (also, there isn't much for jump scares here either, which I was really surprised by). That said, the film does lack steam at times, and propels itself into a conclusion that doesn't reveal as much excitement or surprise as the preceding 80 minutes would lead you to believe is coming. The finale is pretty weak, and follows a pattern that's been done before in other found footage genre films. That's not to say that a horror film requires a twist ending to be worthy (which this film surprisingly doesn't have), but there's not a whole lot of payoff in terms of anything truly shocking or nuanced occurring in the film's final act, and for that, it is predictable. There's a lot of build-up for a pretty mediocre ending.All things considered, \"Devil's Due\" is an oddball in the sub genre in which it's been placed. The film doesn't make any claims to reality, doesn't ascribe to jump scares or a surprise ending, has shockingly worthwhile performances, and, most importantly, isn't actually a \"found footage\" movie at all. The references to \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"Rosemary's Baby\" are indubitable, and despite the film's burnout ending, I still was mildly happy with it, probably because it did the opposite of what I expected it to do in a lot of ways. The flip side of that is that the film doesn't have much in way of surprises, but the above-average performances and a handful of crafty scenes elevated it above any other hand-held and/or found footage horror film to come out in the past five years. 6/10.",

            "content": "'DEVIL'S DUE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another low-budget supernatural horror 'found footage' flick. The story is about a recently wed woman who unexpectedly becomes pregnant, with the Antichrist. It's an homage to the classic Roman Polanski thriller 'ROSEMARY'S BABY' but it's presented in a style that's a lot more similar to the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' franchise. It was written by Lindsay Devlin (who's only other film writing credit is the 2013 documentary 'IN SO MANY WORDS') and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett are part of a collective filmmakers group called 'Radio Silence'; they previously co-directed, co-wrote and co-starred in a segment of the 2012 'found footage' horror anthology 'V/H/S'. I think the filmmaking duo did an exceptional job on this (their debut feature film) and found it to be much better than a lot of critics (and 'found footage' movie haters) have made it out to be.The story revolves around a newly wed couple, named Samantha and Zach McCall (played by Allison Miller and Zach Gilford), that go on their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. After Samantha gets a weird reading from a fortune teller the two are led to a remote bar (outside the city) by a persistent cab driver (Roger Payano). They both get wasted (on shots) and pass out. It then appears that Samantha is taken to a room, beneath the club, where some kind of ritual is performed on her. When they return home they find out she's pregnant, despite the fact that Samantha has always regularly taken her birth control pills. The two decide to keep the child and then things really get strange. It's of course all caught on video and compiled (from many different sources) for the viewer.The film (like I said) got mostly bad reviews from critics and horror fans (that hate the 'found footage' genre). It did get a few good reviews (though) from some scary movie aficionados (like director Eli Roth and the popular horror website 'Bloody Disgusting'). I enjoyed the movie; I love the horror genre and like 'found footage' flicks, when they're done right. I think this one was done right; it's scary, funny and just a lot of fun to watch. The rookie directors did a great job and the script is smart and clever as well. The two leads were also adequate enough (for a film like this); the lead woman is very beautiful too and the lead guy reminds me a lot of a political radio and internet talk show host (I watch) named David Pakman. It's just an all around good fright flick, especially if you like the genre. Ignore the haters!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhLjf_1MKw",

            "content": "Another film where the camera tells the story! A cult looks for couples which the cult victimizes the couples with a nasty pregnancy. What works is the actors and director comes across as real life. I like how the characters' behaviour is detailed with little quirks. Devil's Due's strongest asset is the story's linear progression of events slowly getting worse. As usual the story's protagonist pieces together the bizarre event too little to late. Devil's due is another homage similar to Blair Witch and the Paranormal series. The originality of the camera telling the story genre is getting old. Still a watchable movie. I give Devil's Due a six or seven out of ten. Depending if you like horror movies. Does everyone always have to expire in these films?",

The priest snapping suddenly in the hospital! The teens in the woods getting killed off by Sam whose eating animals insides! The cam SD card (containing the footage of Sam in the ritual) going missing!The film it'self was dark & creepy! The man staring up at the house was creepy! Though the story-line didn't make sense in a way, though I didn't focus on that so much! It was bloody at the end! Had some gory moments! Bleeding noses etc! The part where Sam cuts into the womb! Ouch! The ending was sad as Sam dies & this creepy old man & creepy black taxi driver take the baby away! Then him being questioned by officers! Then the ending where the creepy black taxi driver goes after another couple! Slightly typical ending! Overall I'd say a 8.5/10 for this one! A decent horror film!",

            "review_title": "For a ridiculously overused and beaten genre...this one was actually pretty good",
            "content": "Oh the irony. I am a true horror fan from way back. I love it all except for the rage of \"found footage\" \"hand cam\" horror. The Blair Witch Project was brilliant and since then film makers have been beating this style of film to death and beyond. I am sick of it quite frankly. I won't even go out of my way to watch one and usually when I find out a horror flick is \"found footage\" it gets shut off. But I wanted to see this one through. The irony is how poorly this is scored on IMDb. I thought this was world's better than the awful Paranormal Activity: Marked Ones and the truly unfortunate thing is if they had bothered to make this just a regular old horror film it could have been terrifying and thrilling and a possible ten because the performances in the movie border on excellent believe it or not. The story is stale...I will agree with many others. We have seen this story done again and again and again (thank you Rosemary's Baby and The Omen.) However, for being same old it is well written and follows the necessary predictable recipe. It actually got to the point where I was literally saying out loud what was going to happen next. This sounds like ear mark of a terrible movie but it wasn't terrible. I wanted to know where the story was going, what was going to happen with this young, formerly happy couple and I did feel some heart palpitations with some scenes so bravo to them for that. I am certain if you switch the lights out and sit back you'll be at least a little scared.Part of the reason I think the film was so much better than it should have been was our lead cast and couple. Allison Miller is excellent as Samantha, the mother to be. We are introduced to her the night before her wedding so by the time the changes take effect we sort of see how different she is. She seems like such a happy and normal woman who you can relate to. She plays it very down to earth making her transformation terrifying and she really does a great job. Its a shame she's wasted on an uber-generic found footage horror. Not to be outdone in any way Zach Gilford is also very good as her doting husband. Gilford gets less scenes in front of the camera because he is often behind it filming (how irritatingly stupid.) He also does a terrific job and his intensity in the later scenes really holds the film together. The two of them have truly outstanding chemistry and it really gives this film a lot of credibility to have them in it. There isn't a big supporting cast and no one stands out amongst them but I will mention I love character actor Sam Anderson who has a small and very creepy role as Father Thomas.Honestly, they could have made this one of the best horror films of 2014 if they just filmed it like your every day movie. Every scene I kept thinking this would be so much better, more terrifying and just more fun to watch if it weren't through the supposed eyes of a home movie camera. It shouldn't surprise me though that the directors behind this were also the people responsible for V/H/S a movie I gave a total of ten minutes too before I shut it off. This is superior to V/H/S but they also got a much bigger budget. The only other glaring issue with Devil's Due is it goes on too long. It is the average movie length but you begin to feel like the same thing is happening over and over again. Even during the climatic scenes when all hell breaks loose (pun fully intended) it seems to just keep going when it should get to the point. Still the ending is not disappointing and I found myself wide eyed more than once. Finally when the baby is born...well it's all kinds of messed up and the scene is more than disturbing. Devil's Due is different from something like Paranormal Activity because I don't think they're trying to make you feel like its real. There are some pretty outrageous scenes of telekinetic ability and devil possession that would have best suited a regular horror film (I'm never going to let it go.) Still if you are a fan of the found footage genre...first of all...I'm sorry that you are but this one is of a much better quality than the other junk out there. You could do far worse and while I would never watch it again I enjoyed my first viewing. 6.5/10",

            "content": "First of all, I am a big fan of the found footage supernatural/horror genre and love watching even the lesser acclaimed films. I am the type of viewer that draws the positives out of a very flawed film and enjoy it. So I expected to enjoy something out of this at the very least. My god, what a tediously insufferable film this turned out to be.There is absolutely no innovation or any attempt to try something new. It is so painfully boring.The concept idea was very promising which is basically a found footage rendition of The Omen or Rosemary's baby. However, this film is so dire at engaging the audience due to the most irritable protagonist I have ever seen so far in a found footage type movie. For more than half of the movie, we are tortured with the sickly saccharine antics of a doting husband on his newly wed wife. There is no natural humour to ease the torment and worse for a film of this type, there were actually no scares until the last act.As I said, I am the type of film goer that draws the positives and try enjoy that. So are there any? Well, there is a dog that was amusing for 2 seconds but even he looked bored, thereafter. OK, there is a bit more positives. You do get a predictable climax in an attempt to \"reward \" us for our eternal patience which was efficiently executed but without any unique vision or flair, just the usual creep around corridors and...\"boo\" oh it was just the dog sort of thing. The actors do perform well but the material they have to work with is revolting.At the end of the credits there is a piece of text explaining that this film created 200,000 jobs. Well that was nice to know and the only bit that made me feel good knowing that at least it gave a lot of people work but then I wonder if stating that was an indirect apology and their justification to make this dreadfully boring movie?TO be fair, the film is as polished as it can be for a found footage genre but its all pointless if it fails to engage us in the narrative. If you haven't seen many horror films or supernatural films such as Paranormal Activity etc, then perhaps you might enjoy this more as long as you can stomach the vomit inducing newly weds for half of the movie. I give this a 3/10 rating, mostly for the dog that looked fairly convincing in not wanting to be in the movie. Get a new agent doggy, you deserve better.",

The movie is filmed entirely in first person similar to the Blair Witch Project but more like Cloverfield --- but unfortunately the point of view changes which makes it kind of confusing. It starts as a newlywed couple vacation on their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Nothing is really revealed abnormal about the couple except that the wife is a foster child with a supposed past hard life. They are having a typical good time, but then decide to take a detour to an underground party after being coaxed by a local taxi driver. After they get a little too toasted we see a brief glimpse of some footage at a strange religious ceremony, but then are taken back to footage of them arriving from their vacation back into their new home. We find out later that ceremony has much to do about what happens next. The wife becomes pregnant despite being on the pill, and immediately starts suspecting that there are problems with the baby. She then starts doing strange things like eating raw meat at a grocery store(despite being a vegetarian), causing preachers to cough up blood, and taking night walks into the wild to kill deer and munch of their innards\u0085so naturally the husband starts questioning something awry is going on\u0085.you think?? The movie is scary at times but because it is so predictable you just wait for the eerie things to happen(and they do). There is eventually a story told here that makes some sense as to why things happened but there are a lot of holes to it as well. I will leave out a lot of the specifics just in case you want to watch this movie about an antichrist possession\u0085.i'm not sure why I wanted to watch it myself\u0085I think I was just challenging myself\u0085but overall this is just not that great of a movie, and the creepy feeling only lasted for a short while after the movie was over.",

No body in this cinema jumped even once, and this is the type of film you should jump at.The effects at the end were cool but literally you could walk into this film about 45 minutes through and you wouldn't have missed anything.

There were a few massive issues! firstly as you watch them in the car at the start of the movie they have there camera pointed at a guy on the bike, as they pass the camera scrolls to the wing mirror and the dudes disappeared! he was there and poof had gone, clearly poor editing.Next! the woman carved stuff into the floor and the man who worked a lot in that room building furniture at no point noticed! even though it was a room he did work in! secondly with this point is that she carved wood...so sawdust! I find it laughable that this stuff gets cleaned up whilst someone is in a demonic state! surely the sawdust would be there the next day? it wasn't! she is a very tidy demon..Last massive flaw! she ate 2 alive deer's! and showed super powers, that was the only time she did cool things and even then there was no follow up! surely someone would say on the news crazy woman eats dear or in the other scene at the market she opened and ate raw mince meat! but no! overlooked again.This film is terrible, i'm a fan of the genre but please god stop throwing hundreds of these films out and focus on making a few good ones.AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The parts where she breaks the car window and eats the raw meat in the grocery store are memorable. This isn't a bad movie at all.",

            "content": "Promoted as ROSEMARY'S BABY meets PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, this low-budget found footage movie was first caught the attention of famed director Eli Roth (HOSTEL, HOSTEL: PART II) at which he quoted on his official Twitter account: Don't pre-judge Devil's Due because Rosemary's Baby is a holy grail movie. It's so smart, creative, inventive, and fun. Very very scary. Upon finally watching it, I was like: Is he for real?WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?DEVIL'S DUE revolves around a newlywed young couple, Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) who both experience a mysterious lost night during their honeymoon vacation at Santo Domingo. Upon returning home, Samantha finds out that she is unexpectedly pregnant. Though shocked, the couple is happy with the result. Soon, as Zach starts to record everything with his video camera, he begins to notice a series of odd behaviors in his wife. As months goes by, it becomes obvious that there is something bad going on within Samantha's pregnancy.THE GOOD STUFFDEVIL'S DUE begins promisingly with a sneaky opening scene involving a \"stalker\" prowling at Samantha's house. It's nevertheless a good cinematic tease that both directing duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (V/H/S) has displayed here. Apart from that, the two primary actors -- Zach Gilford and Allison Miller -- are worthwhile as well. However...THE BAD STUFF... Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett botches the would-be intriguing premise with their pedestrian direction. Aside from the middle scene involving Samantha and the three teenagers at the woods, most of the spooky parts are surprisingly low on scare. If that's not insulting enough, the so-called payoff at the finale is a huge disappointment -- all strangely anti-climactic and yet so unfulfilled that you might end up shouting in your mind: Seriously?Added to the disappointment is Lindsay Devlin's uninspired screenplay. It's nothing more than your typical found footage and supernatural horror combo that you've seen many times before.FINAL WORDSAll I can say that DEVIL'S DUE is a total rip-off from the immortal classic, ROSEMARY'S BABY. Save your hard-earned money, and wait for DVD release instead.http://www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",

They pull up at the venue, where the possibility of a party seems far-fetched and even the faintest sound of music is undetectable. When Samantha gets nervous and decides to change her mind we feel a sense of fear and anticipation for what might happen. The storyline alludes to the possibility that the driver has other intentions, however tucked away in the most unlikeliest venue is a live and vibrant rave. The couple relax and party the night away, however, the plot thickens.When the Samantha and Zach get so drunk that they lose track of their belongings, the camera cuts away to reveal clips of muffled voices, a religious cult and what seems to be Samantha on a sacrificial altar.The next morning they both wake up in their hotel room, with a hangover which they put down to their wild night out.They suspect no foul play. Shortly after returning home, despite being on the pill, Samantha announces that she is pregnant. We begin to watch her becoming increasingly hostile and strange things begin to happen.I watched this movie with no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. Zach Mcall journals their life using a homemade video camera, the majority of the film is shot from the first person. The movie looks low budget, as though executed by amateur producers, which is the point. Only after, did I discover that the movie actually had a $7,000,000 budget, and was produced by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. The natural, unforced acting, was so realistic and effective that it will make you question every reality television show that you have ever watched.Devils Due is a peek at what a horror should be. It was atmospheric without the need to jump us. Frightening without cheap scares. Spooky, without the use of excessive sound effects. It was well paced with a flawless storyline. The movie was unhurried and builds a rapport between the viewer and the characters. We get to meet their inner social circle and we learn about the characters background. This window seat glimpse into Samantha and Zach's life allows us to feel a connection with both characters and we are won over by Zach's charm and Samantha's innocence. We are drawn in by the subsequent changes in Samantha's personality. This is why the film works so well because we witness the nightmarish languish of this sweet and loved up couple.Many people will argue that the storyline was not original and whilst I agree there were many parallels between The Last Exorcism, The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, by taking what was lacking in similar movies, Devils Due has put its own unique stamp on this reality horror genre.I was only slightly disappointed by the ending as there was a lot of build up for a pretty predictable ending, but overall I was still impressed. This film does not feel the need to rely on gore and sound effects to win the audience over, just good old-fashioned creativity. All in all Devils Due was kept me on edge the whole way through and is well worth a watch.",

That is the only positive in the whole movie. The movie is very clich\u00e9 and has no originality to it. I have no idea why someone would fund the making of this movie, due to the fact that the script was probably written in 10 minutes.The film overall was boring, and some scenes were just embarrassing to watch, such as the scene in the forest and the scene (which you probably seen in the trailer) where there is a large movement in Sam's stomach. I have seen a lot of comparisons to Paranormal Activity, which are known for building the atmosphere for a climatic ending, Devil's Due fails at this as the ending feels rushed and is over very quickly. (SPOILER ALERT) It then closes to a couple in France, who are then picked up by the same cab driver who took Sam and Zach to the party which leads to the ritual. I have no idea who he is, or who any of the other people on his side are. This means we learn nothing about why they do what they do. (SPOILER END)This film is up there as one of the worst films I have ever seen; it is unoriginal and not scary in the slightest.

The next morning Zach and Sam wake with no memory of the night before, returning home from the honeymoon Sam discovers she is pregnant, despite having taken birth control pills since the wedding day, they are shocked, but overjoyed, telling friends and family, and after their first ultrasound scan they are told the healthy looking baby is due by the end of March. Through the course of the pregnancy though strange things are happening, with Sam having constant nosebleeds, bruising on her stomach, cravings for raw meat despite being a vegetarian, super- strength and telekinetic abilities and unexplained feelings of rage when she or the baby are threatened, also odd-looking people have been randomly watching their house. Zach is convinced something is wrong with the baby, they are seen by a new doctor at the second scan, he may be from the cult who have placed tiny camera in the McCall's home to monitor her progress and make sure she does not hurt the baby that she has become uncomfortable having. Eight months pass, attending holy communion the couple and all people in the church are shocked to see priest Father Thomas (Forrest Gump's Sam Anderson) violently coughing blood during the service, later Zach reviews footage he filmed, he recognises the taxi driver and sees a strange symbol, the priest in hospital recognises the symbol as relating to the summoning of the Antichrist, and investigating a thought to be abandoned house at the end of the street Zach finds the CCTV footage of inside his house, he barely manages to escape before the cult return and perform a ritual. Returning home Zach hears Sam scream and all house glass smashes, he finds her in a trance-like state with a knife to her chest, there is a blast of light, he recovers and finds her lying in her own blood with a cut to the stomach, she cries and wonders if the baby is alright before dying, Zach breaks down grieving and then the taxi driver and second doctor appear, they take the baby regardless of his pleas, Zach is arrested and interrogated by police about his wife's death and the baby's disappearance, we do not find out his fate, but another couple on honeymoon in Paris are lured into a taxi by the same driver. Also starring Robert Belushi as Mason, Catherine Kresge as Tina, Aimee Carrero as Emily, Sloane Coe as Ashley, Tyler Forrest as Steve, Stacie Davis as Karen and Yohance Myles as Jim. I didn't realise before watching this film that it was a \"found footage\" setup, so I expected similarities to The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, the first half of the film start well and you sort of get into it, but I eventually got tired of the plot, I agree there are the odd jumpy and creepy moments, as an overall film I was a little disappointed, but its not the most terrible horror film.

            "review_title": "Yet Another Really Bad Horror Film",
            "content": "Devil's Due (2014) 1/2 (out of 4) The latest awful horror movie has newlyweds Samantha and Zach (Allison Miller, Zach Gilford) excited to be expecting their first child but soon strange things start to happen to the woman and it appears something sinister is going on. DEVIL'S DUE had quite an impressive campaign, which included fans converting to Satanism on Facebook, condoms dedicated to the movie and there was even a mutant baby gag that was going through New York City. The company spent all this money for promotional material but it's really too bad they didn't spend some of that cash on an actual screenplay. Yet another found footage film, this here is without question one of the worst as we're given nearly 90-minutes of boredom with two people we really don't care about. The entire plot is so boring and predictable that I'd recommend you take some rat poison into the screening with you if you must see this. We've seen possession movies countless times before and this one here offers nothing new. We've got a mother with an unknown past. We've got the couple going to a far away location where something happens after them being drugged. We got creeps watching them. We got a husband not knowing what's going on. Blah, blah, blah. I was bored out of my mind around the thirty-minute mark so the next hour really dragged at a horrid pace. What's so stupid that there's pretty much nothing going on in this picture. It's one of those movies where we have 80+ minutes of build-up in hopes of some exciting ending but there two problems. One, the ending is stupid and not scary. Two is that the build-up is just boring and painful to sit through. For the life of me I can't figure out why they didn't try to do more with this so-called horror movie. There are no good scares and even worse is that there are countless unintentional laughs. The only good thing I'll say about this picture is that the two leads are good in their roles. DEVIL'S DUE is yet another cheap horror movie and certainly one of the worst in recent years.",

            "review_title": "A painfully boring pregnancy documentary",
            "content": "When Eli Roth tweeted that Devil's Due is \"so smart, creative, inventive, and fun. Very very scary\", I felt an urge to believe him. However, this was before I remembered the franchise Roth is behind; Hostel, a series of horror films infamous for their gory, obscene content that has divided fans of the genre, to say the least. I have a feeling that Devil's Due may lead to the same result. I for one, strongly oppose this \"horror\" film.Directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, half of the filmmaking collective Radio Silence, the supernatural horror film focuses on a nauseating newlywed couple, Sam (Allison Miller) and Zach (Zach Gilford), receiving the joyful surprise that Sam has fallen pregnant after a mysterious lost night on their honeymoon. Even here there are many frustrating aspects of the film; the couple are so naive that even after Sam's palms are read and the psychic begins urging, \"they're waiting for you\", complete with piercing red eyes, they allow a seemingly unlicensed taxi driver to take them for some \"divertido\" in the backstreets of Santo Domingo. From here they are led through some shoddy red doors into an underground cave/party of some sort, where Sam remarks that there are men watching her from the other side of the venue - one of them being the taxi driver - before the camera cuts out and opens in yet another dark cave, where a Satanic ritual takes place with an unconscious Sam and Zach. This may sound like a vague description, but unfortunately Devil's Due is a vague film - in their struggles to try and make the found- footage style seem authentic, the directors instead create a frustratingly weak and boring storyline that meanders through ninety minutes of nothingness.Although classified as a horror film, the attempts to scare the audience or even make them uncomfortable are non-existent. Instead of watching a horror film this genuinely feels like a documentary on pregnancy, with more time spent focusing on Sam feeling tired or in pain than anything else. There are a few scenes that begin to feel uncomfortable, yet they result in absolutely nothing; for example, during a surprise party held at Sam and Zach's house, Sam claims that she needs a rest. The many security cameras placed in various hidden areas of the house by an unknown clan (these plot holes are left completely unexplained) show her make her way upstairs, before entering the nursery ready for the baby and beginning to carve a large symbol into the floor. A young girl, presumably a member of the family, begins playing hide and seek with a friend/sibling/cousin/relative/boyfriend/acquaintance, complete with a video camera set to night vision. She meanders around the house in darkness for a few minutes, before entering the nursery, where she is welcomed by a demonic Sam screaming for her to get out. Surely this would lead to the family investigating the strange behaviour, right? No. Instead, we cut to the young girl's first communion at the local church, where she seems unfazed by the previous events, and when the priest in the church begins bleeding profusely in the presence of demonic Sam, nobody seems to react to her red eyes, her vacant stare, and her death grip on Zach's wrist.Everything seems to lack a resolution - whether we witness Sam eating raw meat from the butcher's aisle through supermarket CCTV, or we follow a trio of unknown teenagers as they find Sam devouring a dead animal in the woods before being telepathically murdered by an unseen force, none of these scenes lead into the next with a clear cause-and-effect storyline, making the film seem frustratingly disjointed and clunky. The events never escalate into the true horror form until the very last five minutes, during which we revisit a house touched upon extremely briefly earlier in the film, where the cult (which remains unexplained) gather to summon something I have no idea about. It isn't explained at all. I learnt more about ultrasound than the demonic offspring, which is what the film is supposed to be about. And after a rather entertaining sequence during which Zach returns home to find many mysterious members of the cult surrounding him, and his wife's labour causing the house to shake, rumble and almost self- destruct, the birth of the devil child is so underwhelming it actually infuriated me. I endured what seemed like hours upon hours of throwaway home movie footage to reach the climax of the film, during which Sam kills Zach's sister off-camera, Zach returns home to find the furniture flying across the home and his sister slumped in the corner of a bedroom with her insides laid next to her, and tries to comfort Sam which obviously doesn't work. Instead, she throws him across the room a few times (he still goes back to her) before pinning him to the wall in a crucifix pose and cutting open her stomach, before falling on the floor and dying. Zach cries over her bleeding body, telling her that she's fine, as the taxi driver enters the house, reaches into Sam's stomach and takes a perfectly normal crying baby, before leaving.That's it. That is the film. Actually, no, it isn't. Before the audience gets the sheer delight of the end credits, we see another sickly sweet newlywed couple bounce about the streets of central Paris, before hailing a taxi driven only by the taxi driver, who asks if they want to go somewhere fun. So whether the directors' intentions were to create plenty of questions for a sequel or if they simply forgot about half of the purely awful story they tried to create, Devil's Due is definitely an experience I never want to relive. I think I would rather have the offspring of Satan growing inside of me than watch this film again.2/10",

The pace is a little to slow you start to feel yourself drift from the film.& the acting is pretty well done to show a believable scene of a loving couple being happy together until all the strange things start happen some of it is extremely disturbing at time's. Although this film isn't really scary as most horror film of this genre can be this is very disturbing in a physiologically way , its one of those film that get in to you head but its not scary creep you out type of film although it has moment that make you jump at silly moments rather than horror moments.The movie takes place mostly in a nursery with only four characters there along with two hooded wardens. As such, there was a lot resting on the shoulders of these four, and ultimately they didn't really manage to pull it off. It wasn't because of their particular performance, but because the movie was suffering from a bad script and story line. However, compared to the Japanese movie in the same genre, \"Baby's Curse\", & immortal classic, ROSEMARY'S BABY, \"Devil's Due\" fared much better than these two film's.but these movies aren't particularly memorable or noteworthy, iver really. As said it start off pretty well but as i said the story is very weak in the direction of the film, i found the scene to be a little long for the film's story with the pace of the film its a big let down as it start to get predictable its nothing special that we haven't seen before & i think its this is why people are getting fed up with Found footage film's because there isn't anything surprising or hasn't been done before. All in all its not a bad film but its not a great film, it just could have been better, not that the actor's done a good job, it failed due to the writers of the film giving it weak & poor story-line with not plot other than a anti-Christ being born.This is one film you should just wait for the DVD instead of wasting money at the cinema.",

During the pregnancy, Sam is acting a lot more unusual than a hormonal woman. She has supernatural strength, eats raw meat and carves a symbol in the baby's room.

The problem is, when they don't work\u0085they're really awful. (Hated Chronicle\u0085 just putting that out there to be controversial) So, this movie is about\u0085 well\u0085 if you didn't put it together from the poster: After a mysterious, lost night on their honeymoon, a newlywed couple finds themselves dealing with an earlier-than-planned pregnancy. While recording everything for posterity, the husband begins to notice odd behavior in his wife that they initially write off to nerves, but, as the months pass, it becomes evident that the dark changes to her body and mind have a much more sinister origin.Sounds alright, and the main actors are\u0085likable enough. The movie just lacks any kind of substance. It settles for cheap scares and relies really heavily on the satanic imagery, and the shock value of the disturbing pregnancy. It has one to many \"that camera doesn't make sense\" moments, which always drive me nuts, and over all the movie just doesn't make a whole ton of sense. In general, this contributes to the over-saturation of the found footage genre, and will probably only serve to make people dislike them more. Unfortunately a miss.There are creepy moments, but not nearly enough to make it hold up. I would skip this one completely, but if you're looking for a found- footage movie dealing with similar subject matter I recommend The Last Exorcism instead.",

At any rate, something mighty untoward happens to the newlywed couple while they're down there, and when they return to the States, Samantha (Allison Miller) finds herself pregnant despite the fact that she has been on the pill for ages. Suffice it to say, Mia Farrow's Rosemary has nothing on this poor girl when it comes to a questionable conception, followed by a monumentally troubled pregnancy and delivery.\"Devil's Due\" might have been effective were it not so utterly derivative of so many films that have come before it.

All the way through, I kept thinking, they better hurry up, cause that baby hasn't shown up yet, and she hasn't even had it yet,1 hour and 15 minutes into this pile of dung. In actuality, there was a baby doll laying on the darkly lit floor, shown at a distance, which didn't even move, and then a hooded figure covered it and whisked it away. They spent more money on that 3 minutes of video than they did in the whole damn movie. If they thought they were playing an April Fools joke on the public, since it came out on DVD very close to that month, they only succeeded in creating a lynch mob that would like to find them and string them up by their Buster Browns.

While initially excited, Zach begins to notice behavioral changes in Samantha as she develops unusual cravings, becomes withdrawn, and exhibits violent outbursts. Eventually circumstances lead to Zach believing there's something wrong with the pregnancy.Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett of Radio Silence and projects Chad, Matt & Rob and the cult horror anthology V/H/S, Devil's Due marks Radio Silence's first mainstream foray with the film produced by 20th Century Fox and given significantly more resources than previous projects. The pair had been approached by other studios with more familiar \"haunted house\" type horror projects, but the duo went with Fox's pitch of Devil's Due believing it could be unique among the crowded horror slate with its focal point of a deteriorating relationship at its core. When the film was released in January 2014 it was unfavorably compared to Rosemary's Baby as well as lumped in with the previous year's widely reviled The Devil Inside. While Devil's Due is familiar, I don't think it's a bad movie and I do think that Olpin and Gillett deserve credit for taking a new approach to familiar material.While the movie is told from the point of view of a camcorder, this is not a found footage movie as its more akin to Chronicle in terms of its application of the format. With the opening studio logos and the multiple POVs from other sources, it's clear the filmmakers aren't taking this as a standard \"found footage\" format and are using it more for stylistic purposes. The movie tries to make itself stand out from Rosemary's Baby by taking a darkly comic slant to the material and for the most part I think it works. Zach Gilford and Allison Miller have good chemistry and are believable as a married couple and Miller's acting with regard to her deteriorating mental state is well done. The gore work is also quite well done with a good amount of blood and viscera utilized over the running time to mostly good effect. While the movie will be familiar to those who've seen this type of story before, I can give it a marginal recommendation thanks to its style and craft.",

Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring, Insidious, and the list goes in, have all been the talk of the cinema at one point or another. Devil's Due takes a unique approach by neglecting to incorporate ghosts into the mix unlike its brothers and sisters.If you have ever heard of, or viewed Rosemary's Baby, it will ring bells and reveal where this take on possession received its inspiration. Is the former a bad place to learn from? Not at all. The problem lies in the fact that the 1968 version is a far superior film. And not just a far walk home from work. I'm talking as far as Canada is from Japan. Walking distance, no plane.This found footage take on Rosemary's Baby did have some things going for it at the start, but it all went away as the film progressed.A happy pair of newlyweds, Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) go to Dominican Republic for a classic honeymoon get-away. Everything looks wild and exciting, until a strange cab driver convinces them to try out a club nearby. Zach persuades Samantha that one more drink will be fun.The two end up drugged, and forget everything that happened. Viewers witness the camera picking up blurred images of creepy Satanic appearing rituals, as the couple are fast asleep. Once back home, Samantha reveals that she is pregnant.Joy surrounds the household, until the baby waiting process starts becoming very unusual for Samantha. Nose bleeds, and knock off your feet pains can occur at times for any future mother, but developing a carnivorous appetite, violent aggression, and telepathic powers are certainly not normal.Devil's Due did a good job with casting. The two leads are easy to like, and both know how to act. Both have potential to be in bigger and better movies, as they do have the talent. As good as it is to have focus on the characters, I cannot say I was entertained by how long it went on.It was simply happy family chatter, that added nothing to the plot. Zach is a cocky, funny guy who means well, while Samantha is a more laid back, sweet woman who lost her parents and grew up in foster care. They love each-other very much.I described the first forty minutes of character development in a ten second read.It never built up anything particularly special, minus the usual you would expect from this sort of film. People being dragged and tossed by an unseen force is just not amusing anymore. It has been done in Paranormal Activity and Quarantine already, no need for more of that.Nothing was scary or creepy. The jump scares, with the exception of one that caught me off-guard, were terribly obvious, and poorly concealed. A scene or two did have a cool, or humorous effect, standing out as more memorable than the rest.Other than painfully phony coughs by the priest (Sam Anderson), the happenings in the church led to an entertaining few minutes. When Samantha is walking through the grocery store, make sure to keep your eyes on the bystanders. Their reactions made me smile.The two parts I mentioned above were far more interesting than the climax and final few moments. Predictable, boring, and done before countless times. Not to mention the severe usage of plot holes in order to make this film progress conveniently.Without spoiling anything important, here is an example. A surprise party is thrown for Samantha, but she feels tired and goes upstairs. A child wonders up later, looking for the dog I believe. She wonders into a room, and gets scared off by a creepy, possessed looking Samantha.Does she go downstairs and make mention of this? Did no one else hear the loud pitched screams of terror? Is Zach going to question Samantha about it in the morning? Nope, explaining things would be difficult I suppose. A young child would surely run down crying, and make a big deal about it. The plot holes revealed in the last scene of a interrogation room are much worse. Asking yourself, \"How?\", can be expected.Found footage is far from my favorite type of film. Thankfully, Devil's Due managed to do one thing right. Instead of Zach carrying a camera around constantly, the film makes use of security camera's when in public, and cameras are placed around the house. It is clever, and makes more sense when you think about it.The bottom line is that this film brings nothing new to the table, or anything worth watching again. The majority of the acting is strong, but the characters themselves are not memorable or special. Scares may come for people who have never watched a horror film, or jump at their own shadow, but the experienced fans will walk out disappointed.If this is next on your list, I would advise waiting until it comes out on Netlix. And even than, ignoring it would still likely be the smartest decision. This demonic possession phase has run its course. In all honesty, the genius \"Devil Baby Prank\" used to market Devil's Due is scarier and more entertaining than the actual film itself.Superpower Film Scale: 1.5/51: Villainous Waste2: Careless Bystander3: Hero unaware of powers4.

The girl lost both her parents in a car accident and she had to be cut from her mothers womb. She was adopted and she considers them her real parents. They love each other, get married and go on their honey moon where they get lost, get offered a taxi ride by some random black guy and he takes them to an underground club. The girl gets taken to some room where she gets impregnated ritually is the anti-Christ. OK? Happy? I just saved you 45 minutes of your life. Fast forward and watch from there.SPOILER: I know I put spoiler as the tag but this is the real spoiler. What I told you there is a load of garbage. The only interesting part was when you found out she was cut from the womb of her dead mother.OK, so now it gets interesting. Sh*t starts happening around the house that can't be explained. The mother to be is acting crazed, scratching a symbol into the wooden floor of the babies room, she kills her husbands sister, her husband finds her and tries to stop his wife. She goes nuts and throws him with some sort of psychic ability from the anti-Christ but she never remembers anything that she does. He tries to stop her and she pins him up against the wall with psychic ability, she takes a knife and cuts open her womb, falls to the floor and comes back to herself. She dies moments later, the black taxi driver dude comes in with someone else, they remove the anti-Christ from her stomach and off they go so that's why at the beginning he's covered in blood and he's suspected of murdering his wife and sister and getting rid of the baby.That's the last 15 minutes of the movie that's actually interesting. It's not scary at all. The last 15 minutes is the only part an 8 year old couldn't watch. Terrible movie. It's times like these I'm super glad I have an unlimited card otherwise, I might've given a more p*ssed off review.",

One of the main issues against this one is the rather bland and uninteresting premise that brings in the found-footage aspect simply for no purpose as this falls into the conventional trap so many similar efforts utilize here in that way too many scenes here would have little use to be filmed as there's no real concern for either the safety of the videographer at the time or the need to be incognito during filming so there's a large amount of scenes here that really don't need to be filmed in here. Likewise, the film also makes a cardinal mistake of not making the footage pertinent to the main storyline here since this one tends to feature the husband up on murder charges yet never once uses the footage shot in that case, tending to leave it a question as for why that was included in the first place as well as where and how the footage got edited together to make the film. there's little about this that makes sense as for why it was a found-footage movie other than being a gimmick to start with and it tends to leave the film really lacking. Another big flaw here is the first half is just not that scary in the first half here with this one really taking very few enjoyable turns here to really showcase any kind of enjoyable scares which this one seems to think it's full of. The scenes at the grocery store are just lame with her being a committed vegetarian and then scarfing down raw steak, a completely ill- focused freak-out on another vehicle shown through the security cameras from the store and her general crankiness and volatility towards her friends and family which are just not all that scary or thrilling and really causes the first half to feel far more drawn-out and dull than it really should as there's some decent material to work with here. The concept of the cult's activities on tourists by taking them willingly into their hideout to impregnate them with something sinister is a pretty unique and enjoyable take on the concept by making it appear to be done through their own voluntary means to allow them to operate in secret. The burgeoning pregnancy allows for the use of the cult symbols to really come out of nowhere and be a rather creepy motive that's quite unexpected and really draws a lot of unnerving story lines in here, and there's the final half hour which shows off all manner of enjoyable supernatural action with the encounter in the abandoned house, the race to get home and the attacks within as the birth is under way in a truly chilling and fantastic sequence. Still, there's more problems here that tend to lower this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",

It's just that this film is so incredibly awful that it brings the worst out of its viewers. My best friend and I were really looking forward to being scared. She's a fan of the Paranormal Activity series and I love slow, atmospheric horror movies where the focus is more on the characters than on throwing a bucket of blood on the screen. In other words, we were both the target audience for a film like this. This film was just awful. The scares weren't very scary, not even when they were really supposed to be. There were multiple scenes where we were all supposed to be watching the screen pensive and quiet, yet the ENTIRE audience was laughing. I think that the turning point came where, at a baby shower, Sam received a small knife that initially looked like a decorative silver rattle of some sort. That's when I crossed the line and went to the dark side. Laughing, I turned to my bestie and said \"Baby's first shiv!\" I immediately got a thumbs up from the row in front of me. After that point all of the audience started cracking jokes and laughing even louder at the incredibly un-funny scenes. There were only 10 of us in the audience, so I probably wouldn't have acted like that if it were more full, but this was a very bad movie and we all knew it. I think that part of the problem was that the found footage angle was so incredibly forced. If they'd dropped that entirely and focused on the story and scares, this would have been a lot better. I think that they focused on the FF angle mostly because of the directors' previous success with V/H/S. Because the film was so keen on trying to force the FF angle, everything was pretty dull and the FF aspect really felt superfluous. The worst part is that at its core, this had the potential to be very, very good. It's just that the movie tried too hard to cash in on the directors' previous success in the FF genre and bank on people holding fond memories of other similar films that are out there. There's nothing wrong with doing either of those things, but when you try to force it and it doesn't work, that's when you end up with something as awful as Devil's Due. That's the biggest crying shame: this could have been so much better if the directors and film company had tried to do something more original rather than imitate previously successes.",

It would be an interesting and fresh perspective on the tired genre as our hero has to go collect all the impossible footage, from the victims to the cameras in stores, on streets and sometimes even cop cars/interrogation rooms.Until then, we'll just continue getting crap like Devil's Due.So sad how little effort they put into this. Wait, let me retract\u0085they did spend a lot of time watching every single other found footage and supernatural movie to steal from. Most found footage movies are already unoriginal but this one really takes the prize for almost an entire movie of ripped off ideas.It's no secret that I also don't favor supernatural films much and they never, ever scare me. Worse, they continue to be progressively less creepy with each film. By the climax of this film, I was so uninterested, so bored, the \"shockfest\" of objects and people being forced about was just a yawn. Not only have we all seen it all before, it's just routine by now. What's the synopsis? Well, Rosemary's Baby but with countless people who have cameras that desperately hold onto them as if they were parachutes to a skydiver.I understand these films cost under ten dollars to make, so obviously they're profitable, but please, people, stop supporting this kind of uninspired \"art.\" It's depressing how people are using their gifts of filmmaking to create something this degrading. There is no reason to see this. You will gain nothing from these 90 minutes except for a sore neck from shaking it back and forth so much. * * *Final thoughts: (and these were my initial thoughts when seeing this) Just an FYI, the movie genre of found footage is: filled with plot holes, horribly unoriginal, makes little sense and, worst of all, lazy.

Normally, I don't have prejudices with remakes or rip-offs, but some well-honored and acclaimed films leave no room for that and, when that happens, we quickly find that the new movie is so inferior to the first one that it doesn't justify its existence. It's more or less what happens here. The plot is almost the same: Zach and Samantha are a couple on their honeymoon. However, after a party where both get drunk, Samantha feels she is raped during a satanic cult. On waking, however, they thinks this was a dream, not feeling any mistrust when she becomes pregnant. This will change over the course of her pregnancy, as Samantha takes on a strange behavior. The plot brings little new when compared to the classic film that precedes it and it's clearly inferior in quality. It all seems unrealistic, far-fetched and absurd, which is criminal in a film that had low production budget but a huge budget for advertising. The actors' performance is mediocre. Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are the main actors and they certainly tried to do their best, but the truth is that the material they were given was too bad and they just ended up dropping their characters. Personally, I don't blame them, I blame the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) and screenwriter, Lindsay Devlin. The film spends most of its time focused on the changes of the pregnant girl, at a deliberately slow pace that would help create suspense if we didn't predict what would happen so easily, if the ending wasn't so uninteresting and if special effects weren't so basic.",

None the less producers and directors sensing a quick buck for little effort continue to make them,and audiences continue to watch them.The whole point of a found footage movie is that one can believe that what one is watching is real and is happening, but many directors are attempting to tell basically a linear movie story with multiple narrative strands using the technique which requires increasingly ridiculous attempts to include other sources and points of view catching things no one would actually be filming without explaining how and where the footage is coming from. This film is no exception.What we have is essentially \"Rosemary's baby \"via the found footage horror style. Everything plays out exactly as you would imagine it would, featuring a rich couple with a big house that is impossibly good, finding evil in a sinister and dangerous far away foreign locales where evil naturally thrives.They trust a sinister black taxi driver and suffer the consequences when she becomes pregnant with nothing the less than the devil's baby! (Via dark Satanic mass in Latin etc) Complications ensue at an extremely leisurely pace.I give this film kudos in 2014 for still having the \"Evil Moor\" as agent of the Devil, a device many believed had disappeared in Mediaeval times! That said, the acting is not bad and the two leads (Alison Miller and Zach Gilford)here are really very convincing and likable , unlike the awful norm for the genre.The story goes exactly as you imagine from the trailers, very slowly, a pregnancy home video with the (very occasional) scare like scary noises, eating raw meat, priests with nasty nosebleeds etc.Things get mildly interesting in the last ten minutes then everything ends anticlimactically with more questions than answers.However it is not quite as bad as it looks in trailers (though that is no compliment in itself!) and if you understand what you're going to see and realise its no big scary horror movie but basically a pregnancy home video with a diabolical edge then you should be entertained.The final coda suggests they are going for a franchise ..... \" Beware the taxi driver!\" Watch this space folks!",

So... rather than doing what every normal couple would do and simply returning to their hotel, they proceed to follow a pushy cab driver to an underground club in a foreign country and engage in an alcohol fueled dance party. Sam gets black out drunk and she's involved in some sort of ritual which we're shown bits and pieces of.Now home, they find out that Sam is pregnant. As her pregnancy proceeds, Sam begins to experience nosebleeds, bruising, weird food cravings (raw meat), aggression, telekinetic abilities and feelings of rage. The couple begins to feel that they're being watched and that there may be something wrong with the baby despite her doctor's suggestion to the contrary.They attend a first communion of a family member and the same priest who married Sam & Zach (Sam Anderson) is presiding. He begins to cough and hemorrhage blood from his nose and mouth during the ceremony. Zach begins to review the hours of pointless footage he's been taking and sees the crazy cab driver from their honeymoon. Zach then investigates the creepy abandoned house on their block only to find close circuit TVs of his home set up and a bunch of cult(ish) looking members. He escapes and returns home where he hears Sam screaming and the house in shambles. When he finally finds her, she's in the nursery holding a knife which she received from an anonymous person at her baby shower. She telekinetically blasts Zach against the wall and slices open her belly. When Zach comes to he's covered in blood and finds his wife laying in a pool of blood wondering where their baby is before she dies. The baby had been taken out of her womb by creepy cabby and some random dude. We're re-shown the interrogation scene from the beginning and the film ends with another blissfully happy couple being taken to an off the beaten path place by crazy cab driver guy.THOUGHTS: I'll start by saying I'm not a big fan of found footage films. I find them to be a cheap way out and a way for studios to make an inexpensive horror film.That being said, Devil's Due had me super excited. The premise is great, the trailer was good and we were treated to a pretty outstanding promo video called Devil Baby Attack which as it turned out was better than the movie as it... you know... actually showed a baby.If you can't tell by the tone of this review thus far I really didn't enjoy this one. First of all, as I've already covered they buried the lead. Right up front we know dude is going to survive and get caught while girl is not around. Sort of a buzz kill but I could let it slide as I've seen films play with timeline very effectively. This one doesn't. Rather than doing the jump around game that films such as Pulp Fiction or Saw II do so well, this one just showed us the end at the beginning and then showed us how we got there. Snooze.I'm not quite sure why this movie is even rated R. Aside from the belly cutting scene in the last 3 minutes of the movie (which isn't even all that graphic. Lori's impromptu C-section on The Walking Dead was much more barbaric), there's hardly any blood, no nudity, very little bad language and not even an on screen death that I can remember.The story that we're given is pretty weak as all we're really told is by the priest: The Antichrist is coming. Um... OK. We're given a little bit of background about Sam as apparently she was cut from her dying mother's womb and was then orphaned but it's not enough to build a character around.I don't want to completely blast the film. Both of the leads do an outstanding job. They both manage to pull off this found footage in a way that makes you actually thing you're watching real footage. Their facial expressions, the tone in their voices, inflection, etc. is spot on and looks like legit home video footage. Sam Anderson's convulsion scene is very well acted as well, though he plays it a bit \"cooky\" when he's giving us plot points while frantically praying the rosary in the hospital.Perhaps I've seen too many of these flicks but I could tell just by the camera angles whether I should be looking at the character in the shot or in the background. Multiple times I'd be looking in the background of the shot and sure enough there goes dude walking across the screen ala The Strangers. The good news is this was early in 2014 so we could get it out of the way and go on to bigger and better things later in the year. Strong not recommend.",

That's not a bad thing in itself, but unfortunately this film seems to follow the tradition of found footage films...We are treated to a long tedious first half with an annoying couple spouting ridiculous dialogue. The majority of this dialogue is inane and does nothing to advance the plot. In fact probably the only aspect of the first half of the film that has any relevance to the plot is where our couple meet with the psychic. The biggest problem with this narrative style is that it not only makes for a dull film, but it also ends up antagonising your audience and actually makes you hate the characters that you're supposed to care for.Things do improve in the second half once the plot kicks in and our newlyweds do at least become less annoying as the film progresses. This film is billed as a 'Horror' but to me a horror film should be scary. However, for me, this film was 'shocking' rather than scary and there is a difference. A good horror film will keep you continuously scared and will leave you scared even when the credits are rolling. A film that shocks makes you flinch because you're shocked at what you see at that particular moment, not because it scares you. It didn't help that most of the time you could predict when the scares would come and what trick the filmmakers would employ simply because so much of this has been recycled from other horror films.The film isn't even great from a technical aspect; the camera work was shoddy (the camera was shaking about all over the place as if a drunk had got hold of it). The lighting was pretty poor as well. These aspects can perhaps be forgiven as this film was clearly made on a budget.The writing is inconsistent at best; Samantha's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, but her idiot husband put it down to hormones - of course every woman smashes car windows and has psychotic episodes in church when they're pregnant. It just isn't believable that any rational human being would class this as normal behaviour. Devil's due isn't the worst film of its kind that I've seen, but it's far from the best film of its kind and that's the problem. In my opinion, this just isn't worth watching.",

The girl has her palm read. The reader tells her that \"she was born from death\" and that \"they are waiting for her.\" The friendly taxi driver offers to take them to a \"fun\" and \"special\" place. Sound familiar? It's a club out in the slums that's in a cave of sorts. The two get wasted, and they take the girl and do a ceremony with her over a Euro symbol, which we end up seeing everywhere.They go back to the US, find out she's pregnant, she starts acting weird, weird stuff starts happening. She has some type of powers but we don't know what she's up to or what she wants. Finally, 15 minutes before the movie ends we get some action and an attempt to get to the issue. The cab driver makes an appearance, there's chants, and the girl freaks out as her due date is getting closer and closer.Devil's Due combines all clich\u00e9s of strangers in a foreign land, pregnant women, evil babies, priests, etc. that you've seen dozens of times before into one single, unbelievably lame POV movie. Most POV movies are lame. And this one is no different. All the intro peaceful times scenes are dull and pointless. When things start getting creepy we don't know what or why. There's the usual annoying green screen camera. And just as the movie finally is about to come to an end, things get hectic. No explanation is provided, no point is made. The better scenes of the movie ended up in the deleted scenes section. Don't miss those if you make the mistake of watching this movie. You can't really care about the couple, they are dull as heck. While the girl is pretty she and/or her character have no personality or charisma.I'll grant though that Devil's Due features two neat aspects and improvements over every other horror POV movie. The image is at least crisp and sharp, and it features a couple of scenes of people holding cameras who're being thrown and yanked around. One really cool one has the guy lifted into the sky well above a tree line and then dropped on a car. Aside from this, Devil's Due is a complete waste of time.

It's almost surprising, if it's not so sad that the producer or director once thought imitation of other horror films could be a substitute for real tension. Furthermore, displaying it in found footage style doesn't add anything, let alone mask the unoriginality.The lackluster story is about two couples who happily spend their honeymoon, but in the end meet with dubious characters. After some bizarre forgettable occurrence, the bride is pregnant. No, this is not Hangover, although it would've been better. What follows is a mix between pregnancy scare and overused gimmicks. The theme has been used before, but this is acceptable, many movies use already proved formula and produces new material. Devil's Due, on the other hand, cobbles together pieces of other works in hope of anyone who hasn't watched horror movies in years will find it amusing.Its use of found footage mechanic further confuses the plot, because some of the scenes shouldn't have been captured in the first place. It uses all security cameras which are in vicinity of the story, it's not only one vlogger type, yet it still feels unauthentic and staged to capture certain scenes. It probably would've been slightly better if it's done in simple third person view.There's not much excellence in acting either, the usual scream and frantic gaze. As an intimate experience of maternity, the movie could've depicted more personal issue. The scares aren't much better, often showing people in trance or shouting randomly. Every part of the movie is dull, any horror it has is watered down because it's near exact replica of others.Granted, those who had or having the delicate 9 months marathon could appreciate it better, but why would they watch this movie, why would anyone for that matter?",

It seems the producers were aiming for a story like \"Rosemary's Baby\" meets \"Paranormal Activity\", and I'll admit they did fairly well at that much. One fatal flaw in this film is the lack of a real sense of continuity, there are too many disconnects in the flow of things. The second is the use of \"other\" inexplicable cameras. Obviously, it is not the husbands camera during certain scenes, there is a store surveillance camera for example, a hikers camera, and several others. The origin of the others is only revealed later, then the audience has an \"ah huh!\" moment.

The most unrealistic thing is that this totally love-sick couple shouldn't have viewed their honeymoon-footage hundreds of times with their family or in private after arriving home, so they could have seen what really happened during the mysterious party. Why the camera suddenly started to record on that crucial moment isn't explained anyway - or maybe we are to understand that it's the magnetic aura of the devil?

There are moments when you think that things would starts getting better, and the plot would develop more, but unfortunately it doesn't. There are a couple of decent moments in the movie and some mildly freaky scenes, but other than that it's pretty much a big miss.One thing that didn't sit well with me was that Zach is recording & documenting everything for posterity, but the very 1st time he actually checks on something is about 6 months into Samantha's pregnancy (a lot of strange happenings have went on prior to this moment). I mean who wouldn't watch back what they have recorded for the previous day? It may be just a little thing, but it's just one thing that irked me.Apart from the few odd moments here and there as I previously mentioned, it's all rather flat and it's a shame because the two directors, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett, had an enjoyable hit with V/H/S but I feel that Devil's Due is a step in the wrong direction for them.

While trying to formulate a procedural direction you think of each infuriatingly poor decision on behalf of the writer and director and how wasting 89 minutes of your life was easily avoidable.A recently wed couple, Sam and Zach, embark on their honeymoon to a tropical destination. On their final night they go off the beaten path to an underground party at the behest of their taxi-driver. Sam discovers she is pregnant almost immediately after they return home. The rest of Devil's Due is about the alleged terrifying events unfolding around \u2013 and inside of \u2013 her.As a couple, Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are far from distinct, compelling or even believable. Allison Miller's Sam is cute but about as basic as you can get \u2013 case and point: she hugs a juicer she receives as a wedding present. Gilford painfully overacts as the cheesy newly-hubbied other half. He intrusively catalogs their whole life together, obnoxiously toting his video camera everywhere he goes, making sure it is always in focus, perfectly framed and well lit even when his wife is doubled over in pain.Devil's Due is touted as a 'found footage' film. If one more cheesy camcorder style horror movie is released I am going to dig up and then punch Jerome Lemelson's corpse in the face. Apparently a hand-held camera is not enough for our character Zach in Devil's Due. In addition, he is a creepy pervert with hidden cameras throughout the house to capture life as well. Yet it also utilizes security footage at a grocery store, secret cameras in every room of the couple's house and police interrogation footage. This lack of direction must be what happens when there are two directors, Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, working on one film.All the exasperatingly frustrating facepalm-worthy horror clich\u00e9s are included in Devil's Due thanks to inexperienced screenwriter Lindsay Devlin. The plot is not new, not interesting and insanely moronic. Immediately, the main characters obliviously follow a stranger down a dark alley while in a foreign country to go to an unmarked party. Later, all the footage husband Zach painstakingly films is never actually reviewed, let alone uploaded to a hard-drive, so one must assume he buys his SD cards in bulk. Further, the transformation within Sam is purely incidental as the demonic fetus becomes stronger in her womb. In the meantime there is enough stagnating filler scenes to grind the film to an immediate halt.There is nothing redeemable about Devil's Due and the fact it was even released, let alone in mainstream movie theaters, is baffling.Find more FULL movie reviews of recent releases at our website.",

I do have to say that the cast did a good job acting \"realistically\", making suspension of disbelief easier. However, that is the last good thing I have to say.The story is nice at best, and lacks originality, innovation or twists. We've seen similar plots not only in 11.11.11, but the famous cult film Rosemary's Baby.

But if you have seen Rosemary's Baby, the plot is going to be so transparent that you'll already know how it ends about 1/3 of the way through and just hate waiting to see the inevitable, hoping something new comes out of it, which it really doesn't. The acting is not too convincing either and that is a problem for this type of film; you're supposed to be seeing 'reality' not just a movie. There's some fun in pretending the movie is found footage, but this movie doesn't really pretend to be found footage, instead it is simply filmed in that style. It is the found footage style without trying to convince you it is 'really' found footage. Sure we all know found footage isn't real so why make it even harder to believe?The acting is not very convincing either which is a very bad thing for a film that is supposed to be 'real'.At least I didn't stop the movie halfway through.

The script features a good story, one that goes from love to horror as the movie progresses.Zach Gilford and Allison Miller give good performances, they manage to show the transformation of the relationship of their characters due to the impending arrival of their unplanned baby and the strange events that surround the due date.All this elements make \"Devil's Due\" a good horror film, a movie that has many scary scenes to keep you entertained!",

What was once a nice niche to get away from the giant blockbusters, has slowly, but surely, become a virus to us all. That may be a bit harsh to a film like Devil's Due, but the whole genre in general needs a break.. and fast.**Warning, this review does contain spoilers** Watching these horror found footage films nowadays, especially Devil's Due, made me ponder what it would have been like in a nice short cut of 15 minutes in the V/H/S franchise. Clocking in at only an hour and 20, the film still finds ways to stretch. Instead of the wedding, why not start at the honeymoon? Instead of Zach (Zach Gilford) the good intentioned husband making his 4th call on the phone explaining his wife is acting strange, why not move the plot along? Instead of the first doctor, why not start with the creepy one? Yes, the second doctor is creepy, but that's also another problem. Subtly is not the films strong suit. Oh, the Priest is coughing, because he's near the demon baby. I see... And now Samantha (Allison Miller) is turning into Tetsuo from Akira? Because the Anti-Christ growing inside her just isn't interesting enough.Found footage also ruins everything that's happening always. The film does try to do different things, \"mini chest cam\" for one, but what person would see their pregnant wife in incredible pain or smashing the windows of a stranger's car and not drop the camera? And what 7 year old walks around in complete darkness with night vision? I get the spooky element everyone on set wants to make, but it's just puzzling and not well thought out. In this scene the girl is scared by Samantha, which could have been, again, subtly expressed in the next scene when she sees the girl again the next day at the church, but, they decided to go with the coughing priest instead. The cab driver from the beginning of the film in the church was a nice touch, but these are too few and far in between.Though the whole premise is found footage, the question begs, who found the footage. The cult seemingly takes everything, setting up Zach, so who's showing the footage? The Cult? Did they get their hands on the interrogation of Zach as well? Was one of the cops part of the cult? It sure was nice of them to edit the thing together though, for us all to learn about their Devil cult. Because in other found footage movies, the footage is usually found by someone other than the killer. Who, in retrospect, probably wouldn't turn it over to the public for viewing. A Demon in Paranormal Activity, after killing a family, wouldn't use Final Cut and say, \"Hey everyone, look what I did.\" Maybe they would, Demon's are kind of jerks.The good is definitely Allison Miller. She works with what she has and runs away with it. I hope she has a future, because she's really the only redeemable thing to the film. Much better films are Rosemary's Baby, The Omen and even To the Devil a Daughter.",

It is a total rip off of the Paranormal Activity movies, using the same effects, same type of story, and even shot the exact same. I know it's much cheaper to shoot a movie this way, but it's getting a little old. At least throw something new in the movie. But that did not happen. It's like I already saw this movie. So here's the plot. Some guy just happens to decide to start recording his life on camera and his wife just so happens to become possessed during the next few days. Or is that the plot of Paranormal Activity? I don't know, it's all the same. I did like the use of witchcraft in this movie. I found that quite entertaining, though i wish they brought that out more. It was the only original thing in the movie, which played such a minute part. It kind of reminded me of Susperia for a second which made me excited, but kept up with the lame, predictable way out.So poor writing, but I did like the acting. Mainly because I have a massive crush on actress Allison Miller. She did a good job on the film, seeing the knock off trash that she had to work with. She should be more careful in choosing movies to star in. All in all, I gave this movie a 3. I think it's well deserved. If you are going to rip off movies, rip off movies that were done many years ago.

It's one in a long string of \"found footage\" films that doesn't add anything new to the genre, and falls below an even average, by-the-numbers example. It started out sort of intriguing, but it deteriorated quickly. There's lots of little weird scenes that don't seem to add much other than to show the \"strangeness\" of the child/Sam's behavior. For example, her penchant for eating raw meat - captured in a slightly funny supermarket scene, and later in an utterly pointless woods scene with some random characters who show up for no reason other than being killed off. Why would the Antichrist make someone eat raw meat? He's fighting back against all the vegetarians? This is just one example of many pointless scenes/tropes.The end (last 30 minutes or so) was what really killed the movie for me. Although it's filled with decent effects as others have noted, it's basically 30 minutes of Zach running around shouting, \"Sam! Sam! No, Sam!\" and shlt flying around. Killed any slight enjoyment I had. I loved the directors' \"10/31/1998\" segment in the original V/H/S (in fact, maybe my favorite segment of that movie), which bears some similarities to this film, but this fails to have the twists or originality that \"10/31/1998\" had.",

            "content": "This movie is something I can only describe as trailer bait. Most of the scenes seem extremely disjointed and almost as if they were made before the script (whatever 'script' is here) was complete. Whatever didn't make it to the marketing campaign is the lowest level quality you'd ever expect - even from a found footage film.I'd mention characters but I can only scarcely say that they even exist. It seems that halfway through the film, everything sort of goes silent. No two characters communicate after a certain point and its very hard to believe that Sam and her utterly forgettable husband ever had any connection romantically at all. As well, the husband has no reason to suspect anything is wrong when he finally decides that there must be, indeed, something wrong. However, when things are obvious he operates in a wish-washy manner where he can't quite decide what he is doing or what is going on.The climax to this movie? I won't spoil it (obviously) but it is barely even there - almost as if this movie is begging for a sequel that nobody will ever want. Needless to say, I didn't like this movie - either did anyone else who was in the room with me as I watched it. I don't even suggest renting as you'll most definitely regret any money you put forth for this horrifically irredeemable piece of found footage garbage.",

The story is actually quite Rosmaries Baby style, but the only thing that matters to me is how much a movie made an impact on me.This one was quite scary and made me feel uneasy (in a \"good\" way, like a horror movie should do).I felt sympathy for the main characters, and that is more than you can say of your average nowadays horror movie, where it is seemingly all about the kills, and not that you as the watcher feel sorry for what is happening to the victims.If you like this movie, go check out the other releases by the directors (e.g. Their episodes in Southbound, V/H/S or the new Scream movie.)I give it a 7 (or maybe even a 7,5) out of 10, but like i wrote in the beginning, to do this movie justice, rated it as 10, to balance the far too low average score.",

            "content": "Found footage horror movies have varied between the great (Blair Witch),the not so great(Grave Encounters) and the downright awful (Paranormal Activity 4),This offering plumbs new depths, though to give away any of the plot would ruin it for first time viewers and you'll find out by watching that the cast and crew do a good job of ruining this film without any help. There comes a point in any film reliant on hand-held camera's where sanity dictates you would put the camera down. This film tries to get around that by stealing ideas from paranormal activity which would be great if the rooms being filmed weren't near pitch black and all characters seem to be allergic to flipping on a light switch. The husband had me screaming at the screen(not in the way intended by the filmmakers)for his complete inability to achieve anything but say his wife's name repeatedly. In one scene the husband stumbles around ,refusing to use any available artificial light and repeating his wife's name until discovering the body of his sister almost as an afterthought. There comes a point where any person, whether sane or allergic to light switches, would reach for any kind of weapon but nooooo our hero prefers to sound about as tough as an eight year old in telling the hooded figures surrounding his house to 'Go away'. This style of horror used to be innovative. I remember watching Blair Witch in the cinema and being terrified of the clashing rock sounds over the end credits which was a intelligent way of wringing one more scare out of the audience. This isn't innovative, this isn't good (the scene in the forest is the low point of, well consistent low points)I'd recommend it to someone I didn't like but am too busy checking my light bulbs, looking for makeshift weapons(even a slipper could hurt in the right hands)and tentatively exploring whether my girlfriend has been impregnated by the devil while I was a little bit drunk",

O no random people put a spell on her.. and what she eats raw meat at the super market after 30mins in... I mean I would of hoped for more dramatic scenes earlier ... Big needle in the stomac wtf... Lots of the stuff was pointless ... I mean we get the point shes got an evil baby but nothing builds up it seems.... The what and why seemed pointless and boring... Nothing new to the table... To much mundane life scene, bbq, zip lining, clubing, baby shower, dog jokes, grocerie shopping its just boring... I wish this would add up to a creepy build up but its a bunch of creepy scenes that adds nothing to the characters... I would recommend this for people who are beginning with horror flicks or people who really love those evil pregnancy found footage films... Im 50min in the film 40mins left and o no first comunion scene of I don't know who... Sick priest .. I mean wtf cut the crap... They just took someone boring home videos and added crappy creepy stuff that leads to nothing.... The film also lacks good music... OMFG RED EYES!!!!",

It still doesn't have the pace it requires to get things started. It also fails to keep you in suspense for the majority of the film. There are many good things in this film despite major problems, unfortunately not enough to give it a Positive review. For one the characters are very likable, I felt bad that they had to go through this. I feel the husband really cared for the baby and the wife. The wife herself acted nicely as well, you can tell she was scared and worried for the baby and herself. They weren't annoying or aggravating. When it tries to scare you it doesn't do a bad job it leaves you thinking what the f*** did I just see. But that being said this only happens in the last 25 minutes of the film, which is saddening. This film had so much potential but sadly falls flat.",

If it's them, then they should stop making new movies and rename the characters in their old movies and call it a new movie.It's supposed to be scary movie but it's not. it's just silly and stupid... I watched it with my wife hoping there will be at least one good or interesting scene but no that didn't happen. And the ending is even stupider. It looks like there will be sequel!!!....

            "content": "Don't waste your time watching this movie. It's the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The characters are dumb (they are actually the most dumbest characters in a movie ever), the acting is bad, it's one of those movies with the characters holding and recording the movie (which was not a good idea. They shouldn't of made the characters be the ones who record), the camera was shaky the whole movie. You could never have a proper look at the setting or anything because the cameras just shook all the time. The scares were the worst because they weren't even scary.These dumb people called Zach and Samantha are on their honeymoon. They go to some random place and meet their taxi driver. The taxi driver is in some cult thing but THEY GO WITH HIM!!! HAVE THEY NOT LEARNT STRANGER DANGER YET BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY DECIDED TO GO TO SOME PARTY WITH A TAXI DRIVER THEY JUST MET. Well yeah, something bad happens so we can't blame anyone but Sam and Zach. The taxi driver does some weird cult voodoo magic thing or some spell from Harry Potter and it gets the girl pregnant.They go home, weird stuff starts happening and Sam goes crazy like absolutely CRAZY!!! Some little girl and boy who are related to Sam are playing hide and seek in Zach and Sams house (I think it's their) and one of the little kids go up and then Sam gives a 'Jump scare' which wasn't even scary and is like \"GET OUT\" because she wanted some space to carve some random Satan or cult symbol. Sam was always carving some symbol into her floor because she was a crazy demon thing. Sam was sleeping and her stomach grew because of the baby but when she woke up her stomach was back to normal. Zach and Sam saw some weird cult dude outside looking up at their window. The taxi driver cult dude was in the church and did some weird voodoo Harry Potter spell to make the Preist have a stroke.When Sam dies and has her demon baby, guess who's there!! Oh yeah it's the cult dudes here coming to take her baby. The taxi driver and his cult friends take he baby and leave. Sam dies when she's having the baby because it's a demon and the weird thing is. SHE DIDNT HAVE HER BABY AT THE HOSPITAL. She literally layed on her dirty ground and had her baby and died so those cult dudes broke in and STOLE THE BABY. I think the police arrived and saw Sams dead body and I think they though that Zach murdered Sam because he was the only one left so he has to go to the police station and talk to them about it.So now you know the story choose if you want to watch it. It's crap so I don't recommend it but after ready the story if you want to watch it, go ahead but I'm warning you, after I watched it, I knew I was never going to get the hour and a half back!",

            "content": "Horror had a great year in 2013; regardless of quality, audiences turned out repeatedly for original films, sequels and remakes in response to what could almost be referred to as something of a renaissance. Come January, 'Devil's Due' arrives to buck that trend, in the worst possible way.Audiences are undoubtedly now tired of all of the following; found footage, found footage that must be justified by lazy dialogue explaining why a character must hold the camera at all times, evil cults, and cheap scares. 'Devil's Due' is abundant in all of the above. It's a film with a disturbing premise that amounts to nothing more than a revision of anything utilised in horror over the last year, where it was utilised much better. Among its few saving graces is a refreshing switch in camera technique to service the story better, which comes a relief when characters continue to mindlessly film the most terrifyingly inconvenient situations in which to hold a video device.Like one of the lesser instalments in the 'Paranormal Activity' series, the film descends into an all too familiar period of 'great' intensity before ignoring all loose ends as it closes with an obvious cliff hanger.'Devil's Due' is inspired, for sure, but only by a number of pictures that set the bar (low). It's mildly compelling, and suitably short, and therefore remains a slightly acceptable manner in which to waste an hour and twenty minutes.",

Maybe a cool scene or two, but nothing all that impressive. Anyways, the whole found footage thing is getting old. It turns into a sense of why is this person holding this camera at this particular place and time. Sometimes it's who is holding the camera and why? There was a point where you could see the main actors two empty hands, but he was supposed to be holding the camera. A little sloppy there. Movies today can be just as effective without the found footage crap.The movie itself was kind of typical of a possession horror movie. Girl gets impregnated by an evil force, you know what happens next. No surprise. Why would you even go to the Dominican Republic on a honey moon? I guess everyone has their own thing.",
