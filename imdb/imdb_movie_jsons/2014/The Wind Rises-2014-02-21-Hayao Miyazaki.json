            "content": "\"The Wind Rises\" is a highly fictionalized version of the early years of aeronautical engineers Jiro Hirokoshi and Tatsuo Hori...with a very strong emphasis on Jiro. The fact Hiyao Miyazaki would make such a film isn't all that surprising, since he seemed to have a real sentimental attitude towards early airplanes in several of his films (such as \"Porco Rosso\"). However, I was a bit surprised when I learned about the film since the planes these two men made for Mitsubishi were important components of the extremely nationalistic Japanese military of the 1930s and 40s...an era many would probably choose to forget.Not surprisingly, this is a Miyazaki film that is not at all intended for children. In fact, I wouldn't bother showing it to your younger audiences...they'd be bored. Plus some parents would object to all the smoking and cursing...and there's not a single Totoro or flying witch to be seen! As for me, I understand that many Japanese animated films are NOT intended for kids and that isn't a bad thing at all. In this case, Studio Ghibli managed to make one of the loveliest of all their films in \"The Wind Rises\". It is extremely touching in parts, especially when dealing with Jiro's fated romance. In fact, the film practically screams quality throughout and it's not at all surprising that it was nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Well worth seeing.Incidentally, Jiro's infamous Japanese Zero was interesting because by the end of the war almost every single one of these aircraft had been destroyed...and I wonder how he felt about this. Ironically, one of the few Zeros to survive did so because it was captured and taken to the States for testing and evaluation.",

            "content": "This is a breathtaking masterpiece of art that allows your mind and heart to soar like the wind .The story is loosely based on the real life story of Jiro Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). He dreams of flying but, because he's nearsighted, decides to be a Japanese airplane designer. We observe his life from child to adulthood as he makes his dream plane and, in the process, falls in love with Naoko (Emily Blunt). Will Jiro create the beautiful plane or realize that the beauty he's seeking is right in front of him all along? The film is a work of art. Hayao Miyazaki (Director and Writer) creates unique color palettes and designs. Since the movie takes place in the sky, the animators go above and beyond to hand draw backgrounds and movements for the planes. We witness them majestically soaring through the skies and you feel as if you're with them. The voice acting is well done. I think they portrayed the characters and their relationships exceptionally well. Much of the film focuses on the romance between Naoko and Jiro. Their connection is both loving and tragic. The film was first released in Japan, so American voice-overs are dubbed over the animation and yes, it can be distracting. They confront actual events that happened in Japan, such as the Kanto earth-quake of 1923 and Japan entering the war. I love the truth in this film. It doesn't shy away from talking about the real issues that happened during this time.My favorite character is Mr.Caproni (Stanley Tucci) a historical Italian aircraft designer who is Jiro's mentor in his dreams. I enjoy Stanley's voice acting skills. He's one of those character actors who is fantastic at everything he does. The character himself is fascinating. He looks at aircraft not as a bringer of war, but a creator of dreams. My favorite scene is the last dream sequence, after Jiro goes through a life changing experience. This is one of those bitter sweet endings, where you don't know what to think at first. You just need to take it all in.The message in this film is, \"Sometimes the outcome to your dream is not always what you expect.\" Jiro spends his whole life wanting to make his aircraft, determined to do anything to fulfill his goal. After a few sacrifices, he realizes his potential but it's not what he expects. Mr. Caproni then asks him, \"Did you have a good ten years?\"I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11 to 18-year-olds. This film shows people smoking and deals with serious issues of the time. This is a must see film! Reviewed by Keefer B, KIDS FIRST Film Critic. For more youth reviews go to kidsfirst.org.",

            "review_title": "Half an engineer, half a poet, eternally a dreamer",
            "content": "... maybe that's Miyazaki's secret, finally unveiled in his latest movie: \"The Wind Rises\".You know, it's been three months since I discovered his work\u0085 and I never had to experience any kind of disappointment. And although I got used to his unequaled capability to catch my eyes and my heart, some of his movies really hit a sensitive chord, like \"Kiki\" or \"Ponyo\" and perhaps the action-less moments of \"Nausicaa\".But I can't really describe the effect \"The Wind Rises\" had on me. For one thing, I'm glad I'm discovering it late because it's the film that best captures Miyazaki's love for airplanes. His passion never went unnoticed; how could it be? Almost half of his movies involve airplanes, flying devices or stunts in the air, but there has always been an element of fantasy that distracted from the personal approach he had to flying, even in \"Porco Rosso\" which was the most explicit homage to the Italian contribution to aviation.But \"The Wind Rises\" made me realize how fantasy is perhaps the sincerest medium to convey passionate matters, because -to put it simply- it's all about dreams and vision that wait for the right wind to carry them a little and give them that extra push they need for flying. \"The wind has risen, one must try to live\" is the excerpt from Paul Val\u00e9ry's poem that novelist Hori Tatsuo used as an inspiration for a tragic romance, and who else than Miyazaki could explore such a story, he who had dedicated all his life to things in the air, from feelings to\u0085 plain things (pun intended). One thing he had in common with Jiro Horikochi, the main protagonist.The film deals with planes in a way that has never been touched by Miyazaki, it's not about flying but about the dreams of flying, their very blossoming in the fertile soil of a man's mind. In fact, the film is less devoted to planes than to the devotion of a boy, then a man, who designed the Imperial Army's most notorious aircraft. They were used in the war but the film has a point to make about war. Miyazaki believes in Jiro's humanism and expresses it through very riveting dreamy moments. Jiro is a dreamer, literally, and whenever he dreams, he meets his all-time idol, Italian Giovanni Caproni. Together they share their views about planes, their universal appeal and sadly their belligerent uses (or misuses).But don't get it wrong, just because it's in the poetic vicinity of Miyazaki's usual works, the film is as realistic as any serious biography picture, although fictionalized with a romance adapted from the \"Wind Has Risen\" novel and many events that struck Japan from the Great Depression to Kanto's earthquake, and last but not least, the war. Jiro is portrayed as a witness of his time who must adapt to the evolution of society, a two-pace society with a feudal heritage yet trying to match the Meiji dream. The most emblematic image is the prototype being pulled by ox. This is Miyazaki's most personal film, it has Japan, it has humanism and well, it has planes. And to give you an idea, this film is far more revealing about Jiro than \"A Beautiful Mind\" with John Nash. There was something so catching in Jiro's passion, in the way he kept focused on his job. I could even feel I was venturing into his mind as if Miyazaki met him in his dreams before making this film. I have no clues about planes but I do love a movie about passion, this is a film about a man who loves planes by a man who loves them. To judge a good biopic, I guess it all comes to the area of passion driving the maker. Having thick glasses, Giro could never fly but Caproni almost rhymes with epiphany, the Italian icon tells him that he can't even fly a plane, but there's just something far more exhilarating than creating. And Miyazaki wouldn't disagree.The heart of the film is centered on the romance between Jiro and a gentle tuberculosis stricken girl, like Hori's wife who inspired the novel. And whenever they meet, the wind rises and make their encounter possible. Air is our universal heritage, in the film, it reunites people and give a proper meaning to their life. This air so fragile in \"Nausicaa\", this air that symbolizes peace in a world that prepares to war and about which the post-apocalyptic Nausicaa warned us. Miyazaki signs his best film. I enjoyed it so much it could have been twice longer, to the post-war period time.But the film culminates with the tragic ending and doesn't show much of the war. It is anticlimactic to use a technical term, but I guess it's a fine ending because there wasn't much to add about Jiro once he designed the prototype, once the plane that started as a concept hidden behind a fish bone became a technological marvel. The film is dedicated to the engineer and to the poet. And the verse \"The Wind Rises, one must try to live\" is so beautiful it could work as an epitaph for Hayao Miyazaki, summing up his best contribution to animation: inviting us to dream, to pursue our dreams and to take them seriously like a poet, a bit like an engineer, always like a dreamer.This is one of the greatest animated movies of recent times, and given how critical I was about \"Frozen\", I was shocked that it won the Oscar. From what I read, there was some controversy surrounding the peaceful nature of Jiro, a sugarcoating of the war and an overuse of smoking. I'd say \"The Wind Rises\" deserved better than being beaten by a film that tried to play the \"socially relevant\" card to death. But the masterpiece flies over \"Frozen\" like a zeppelin over a fish bone.",

            "review_title": "Miyazaki's swan song doesn't disappoint",
            "content": "I don't know if I loved it right from minute one, but then it doesn't quite start like any Miyazaki film (well, even with a dream scene). Its a little quieter, more natural, thoughtful and subdued, much like the main character will be through the film. And then earthquake hits. Its unlike anything you've seen in an animated film. It doesn't hype up its suspense or action. it simply shows Its protagonist, Jiro, react to a situation as calm and controlled as possible amid the debris and darkness and chaos, and help a couple of people in need. of course he doesn't know this young woman he saves will be an emotional foundation for his life. But as with any simple but splendid poetry we have a sense of the connection made.Any other director might just make it a film about the 1920s earthquake that devastated Tokyo. Not Miyazaki. Soon after Tokyo is up and running and Jiro is after his passion which is airplanes. He dreams about them, and more than that dreams about the Italian icon of flying he looks up to as he gives Jiro advice and philosophical points about flying, inspiration and technology. And very soon after the film is more than anything about this man and his process - finding without any grandiose strokes what can make a plane fly quicker, faster, safer, with more agility and s look like no other. And, sometime soon, finding a love all his own.Miyazaki has said (once again but probably for real this time) that he is done making films with the conclusion of the Wind Rises. If so, that's fine. I'm not sure if it's any sort of culmination of what his career has been or what he's said - Though you could certainly have a double feature with Porco Rosso, also about the wonder of flight but more in an adventure fantasy approach and have a fantastic several hours - and yet it's no less a marvel than anything else he's made. And if anything it just reveals more depths to how he feels for people and can show them in dimensions on screen than ever before. It is a biopic still, and a line here or there may be cornball, but so what. Its a fiercely intelligent film with genuine sentiment and a grace that comes from being a master letting your story unfold without rushing, letting scenes play out for full emotional weight, And ample colors and compositions painted with nostalgia for a mood (if not necessarily a side in history).And yet you may think going in that there will be some sort of agenda politically speaking as it looks at a man who helped, ultimately, design planes that dropped bombs and shot and killed the US during world war two. It really isn't, or as simple as that. A couple of scenes with a German businessman of a sort voiced by Werner Herzog (yes the one and only, you'll know him when you hear him) lays out the futility in war and conflicts. And Jiro agrees. when someone speaks to him about what planes will be sent to fight whom, he is already resigned. \"Japan will burn,' he says more or less. And yet he always stays more pragmatic, more about the work and the hard enough task to make the planes and make them fly high and well. This double edged sword also comes out when he is talking to his Italian guru in his dreams (especially the last one at the end of the war).With all of this, the Wind Rises is a touching love story that seems possibly very doomed from the start - before getting engaged Jiro is told by Nahoko she has Tuberculosis and he doesn't care, or at least about that deterring him away - and how strong their bond is. How often do we get to see people in a movie, animated or otherwise, act like this to one another with kindness and compassion and a tenderness that (for the most part, maybe there's a bit of that \"Japanese Disney\" schmaltz but not much) is without any reservation? Not often really, at least like this as told at times without words at all; the high point of the picture is when there is a kind of wordless courtship as Jiro flies a paper plane around and it goes to the girl and she flies it back out as he chase to catch it and it repeats. The moving music, the amiable tone of the whole set piece, the mild peril... I'm at a loss to how much that just works because it feels true.Did I mention its among the ten most beautifully animated films ever made? And I'm sure that group includes Mononoke and Totoro already. And I know full well a term like 'beautiful\" is overused and tired. But Miyazaki crafts his works (or did) by hand with gorgeous, clear lines, water colors and maybe some cgi, and it both serves the story and its own sense of the world it's in: the earthy greens, the shiny clouds and blue skies, the metallic force of the planes, the drab grays of the offices and plane hangers. And yet you are still wrapped up in the tale of this man and those who cared about him or were inspired by and led by him, and is another rarity (easier to pull off in literature, trickier here and Miyzaki just about pulls it off): a mild wind that grows with power and energy, briefly, and then ebbs and flows with reality and, again, thought.",

            "review_title": "Deeply beautiful",
            "content": "Miyazaki's swan song, most likely. It's an animated biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese aircraft engineer who developed the Zero, the plane which would eventually bomb Pearl Harbor and do kamikaze attacks in WWII. The man himself was a pacifist (at least according to this film). Most of the film just deals with the man's love for flight, which obviously makes the story very dear to Miyazaki. In fact, a good portion of the film takes place in Horikoshi's dreams, where he can invent any crazy contraption. First and foremost, the film is gorgeous. Though it mostly deals with the real world, it finds the beauty in it. As good as the film is, it isn't one of Miyazaki's best. It's a little long-winded and slow (definitely don't take your kids to it, even if they're big Ghibli fans). Miyazaki kind of neuters the militaristic history of Japan at that time. You can feel some terrible stuff going on in the background, but, outside of the Germans, whom our hero visits at one point, all the characters whom we meet are perfectly nice people. I would have liked a more detailed picture of history at the time. Also, the romance that is depicted in the film, which is entirely invented, is a tad too maudlin (though it is quite nice up front). And, though I won't hold it against the film itself, the English language dub is awful. This may be due to the film's specific, Japanese setting, but I really felt the voice actors were just dull as Hell. I hate to say it, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the lead role is the worst. The least offensive performances come from Martin Short and Mae Whitman (the latter is a professional voice actress who is great on Avatar: The Last Airbender, though she is best known for her role as Michael Cera's dull girlfriend Ann on Arrested Development). I wish I had just seen the subtitled version instead (it was playing here, but at an inconvenient theater). I might like the film better seeing it subtitled. All those criticisms don't amount to too much, though. It's a wonderful film.",

            "review_title": "Miyazaki's most mature film?",
            "content": "The announcement of this film was a pleasant surprise after Ponyo and From Up on Poppy Hill, which both had simple, childish plots. Few films in Japan have tackled the lives of imperial period heroes; the ghosts of the 1960s urge people to denounce what really happened in that time and memorialize an imaginary anti-war movement, for example in this year's film \"Shounen H\". For Miyazaki to choose a subject like this showed that he was really going for a huge challenge. Miyazaki is of course anti-war and environmentalist. But Ghibli films are never negative. What sort of positive image of the Zero bomber inventor would Miyazaki produce?The result is astounding. As everyone has noted, this is not a children's movie. It's complex, so it doesn't have the epic sense of Miyazaki at his best, but history and adulthood are just as complex, and Miyazaki does justice to both. The film indeed stays positive throughout, by showing from start to finish how everyone wishes they themselves would behave, rewarding the viewer with virtue and beauty, but without being condescending about the hardships of real life. In a sense, the film is about the \"importance of dreams\", but it's also about what it means to be a dreamer in real life, and how our highest fantasies can be turned into beauty if we put our minds to it. The cartoon medium is put to full, extravagant use in dream sequences that merge right into the narrative. Certain elements at the end of the film leave the obvious unsaid in a peculiarly Japanese and fulfilling way. The most classic films of Japan, like the great works of Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, say something profound about the meaning of life, and Kaze Tachinu deserves a place among those ranks.",

            "review_title": "Dispirited Away",
            "content": "\"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\" - J. Robert Oppenheimer Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, \"The Wind Rises\" tells the tale of Jiro Horikoshi, designer of the Mitsubishi Zero, the lightweight and highly manoeuvrable fighter plane that enabled many Japanese victories early in World War II.\"Humans have always dreamt of flight,\" Gianna Caproni, an Italian aeronautical engineer, tells Jiro, \"but the dream is cursed!\" In sequences like this, Miyazaki sets up the film's central theme: not only that flying machines will inevitably be used to massacre human beings, but that every human endeavour, every piece of art, every piece of technology, is inevitably compromised.Later, Jiro and Caproni discuss the Great Pyramids. \"I'd rather live in a world with pyramids than a world without,\" Caproni states. The implication is clear: dreams may be cursed, pyramids may be built by slaves to honour tyrants, but better them or nothing. That this is a false binary, or giant straw-man argument, is lost on Miyazaki; one can always extricate oneself from problematic actions or systems.But the difficulty in extricating oneself from such things, or noticing them in the first place, is what seems to interest Miyazaki. Jiro himself eventually emerges as a \"Little Eichmann\". A reference to Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann, the term refers to anyone who on an individual scale seems dutiful, benign or harmless, but is nevertheless complicit in aiding or propagating destruction. As such, Jiro's romantic idealisations are subverted throughout \"The Wind Rises\", culminating with the death of his wife to tuberculosis. Jiro may remain naive, but bombarded with much dread and apocalyptic imagery, Miyazaki's audience is never allowed to forget the darker ramifications of Jiro's actions.Though Miyazaki never really sanctions Jiro and Caproni's romantic rationalisations, the intensity at which Miyzaki portrays Jiro as a wide-eyed moron has led many to accuse \"The Wind Rises\" of whitewashing Jiro's historical role. Jiro's planes, after all, were built by Chinese and Korean slave labour. They were used to attack Korea, invade China, the Philippines, Vietnam and so forth. Historians point out that Japan's militarism was hardly unique in terms of early 20th century Imperialism (no better, the Empires of France, Russia, Britain and the burgeoning United States would account for far more deaths), but \"you did it too\" is no defence.Odd for a lead character, Miyazaki's Jiro is passive, lacking in any self-reflexivity, and never questions what's going on around him. Despite (or because of) this, the film works well as an allegory about the innocence, arrogance, myopia and culpability of artists, and the way in which states co-opt and pervert the aspirations of individuals. Such themes are typical in Japanese animated features (everything from \"Akira\" to \"Sky Crawlers\"), the nation seemingly forever sceptical of urbanisation, modernisation and every new piece of technology it rampantly gobbles up. Miyazaki is himself a bit of a technophobe. \"Modern life is thin and shallow and fake,\" he moans in interviews, \"I look forward to when developers go bankrupt, Japan gets poorer and wild grasses take over!\" \"The Wind Rises\" is as gorgeous as Miyazaki previous films, bouncing from bucolic, agrarian Japan, to urban spaces, to several long flying sequences. Elsewhere scenes in 1930s Germany echo a German tourist's visit to Japan, and the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 foreshadows the atomic destruction of 1945. Jiro's wilful naivet\u00e9 itself resembles that of the physicists who split the atom.What's perhaps most remarkable about \"The Wind Rises\", though, is the way it accurately captures the psychology of those working at the cutting edge of high tech industries. Jiro is intelligent, passionate and single-minded, but always moving between hotel rooms, offices and lonely spaces. This alienation, Miyazaki says, is precisely what makes Jiro's intelligence so dangerous. Cacooned and sheltered, Jiro belongs to a learned class which rarely meaningfully interacts with \"ordinary people\", and so rarely questions the morality and ramifications of its own behaviour. The result is a lead character whose brain is incredibly parcellated, steeped in all forms of sophisticated denial.This being Miyazaki, \"The Wind Rises\" is also obsessed with notions of \"Progress\". Miyazaki's Japan becomes corrupt and perverse as it embraces the \"emacipatory\" tenets of Modernism. These \"perversions\" are subtly mentioned by Miyazaki (if we ignore his heavy-handed dream sequences), such as sequences in which poor children roam the streets, or when banks foreclose on civilians. The result is a very sophisticated portrait of a nation in decline at the precise moment it embarks upon a project to lift itself up.Many have complained that \"Rises\" isn't as fun as Miyazaki's other works. Indeed, the film at times seems like a dour melodrama by Yasujiro Ozu. But Miyazaki subverts the conventions of the melodrama at every turn. Consider, for example, the way Jiro's blindness (literal and metaphorical) echoes the film's very own aesthetic and narrative structure, which relentless avoids looking at or thinking about warfare. For this is a film about a young man who is so preoccupied with love, life and aviation, that he doesn't realise that he's helping rain destruction down upon Japan (the spectre of the atomic bombings loom over the film). In this way, \"Rises\" plays like an anime version of Stanley Kubrick's \"Barry Lyndon\" (or De Sica's \"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\"), another film in which surface beauty and foregrounded decor ironically counterpointed thematic underbellies.\"Rises\" boasts Miyazaki's most autobiographical script since \"Whisper of the Heart\". Parallels are drawn between aeronautical engineers and animators, between hanger bays and animating studios, and Jiro at times resembles Miyazaki himself, with his bespectacled eyes and love of wind-swept wings. Elsewhere Jiro smokes Cherry cigarettes, Miyazaki's brand of choice, and scenes in which Jiro's sister accuses Jiro of neglecting his family echo Miyazaki's own outspoken fears. \"The Wind Rises\" is reportedly Hayao Miyazaki's last animated feature; farewell Master.8.5/10 \u2013 Multiple viewings required.

            "content": "So when I first saw that an anime called the Wind Rises was coming to theaters I could not wait to see it simply because it was an anime coming to theaters. I had no idea what the movie was about, but when I saw the movie, I discovered it was about one of my Favorite subjects, Airplanes. It's a very simple story that could have been done in Live-action. Jirou who as a boy met his hero, airplane designer, Caproni in his dreams was inspired to become an airplane designer. Years later Jirou lives his dreams and designs airplanes for a manufacturer who sells his beautiful designs to be used for the Ugly art of War. Jirou also fines love in the movie with a young girl name Naoko. All the characters in the movie who supported Jirou, from his little bratty sister, to his firm but fair boss, to his best friend and rival at work. They all help to make you feel like Jirou had a real posh life. I also loved how the story gives us a perspective of Japan pre-World War 2 through the life of Jirou. All of this could have been done in live action, but the craftsmanship of fame director Hayao Miyazaki makes you think otherwise. The animation takes a very surrealistic approach to telling this drama without making it seem cartoonish like Mickey Mouse. The scene portraying the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 made the ground feel like it was coming to life as a giant wave just took out an entire city. The Dream sequences worked very elegantly, just naturally seeming through. And the planes! the animation team did a great job of making the entire layout of the airplanes look fantastic. I've seen dramatic anime where the animation does nothing to push the story along but Mr. Miyaazaki did fine work to make sure that was not the case. It's been forever since I've seen a 2D moving illustration on the big screen, it felt a little weird, but this was definitely the movie to bring us all back to that. Someone told me that Hayao Miyazaki may retire after this one as he feels he can't top this. I will not disagree, because this one is excellent.",

As I am a Taiwanese, who has once colonized and ruled by Japanese during the second world war, how Japanese coped with the war topic is always sensitive. However, what I saw in this film is truly reflecting that Miyazaki is peace loving and his point of view on war, life and love. He depicted about the beauty of dreams and surviving. You can see that everyone in this film try every hard to live, even though the time is hard and forced to strike a balance between dreams and reality. However, they are self fulfilling. So who is to blame? who ruined their lives and dreams? Those who leads them to the war to blame.In short, the film perfectly shows how the director's been telling in almost every his masterpiece but in a personally way, to the audience. Just like a final message he would like yo transmit to the world. I felt overwhelmed by the film and sad that he decided to retired.

            "content": "This film, Hayao Miyazaki's last, tells a fictionalised account of the life of the aircraft designer Jiro Horikoshi. From a young age Jiro dreams of flying although his poor eyesight means he will never be a pilot. After reading a magazine article he dreams of meeting Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni; after this he decides to pursue a career in aircraft design. As he travels to college by train he is caught up in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. On the train he meets Naoko and after the earthquake he helps her and her injured maid. After graduating he finds work at Mitsubishi and it is clear that Japanese aircraft design is far behind that of the west but he and his friend Kiro Honjo are determined to help them catch up. After an early setback Jiro takes some time off and bumps into Naoko again and a romance soon blossoms. She tells him that she has tuberculosis but after some time in a sanatorium they are married. He continues to work and makes great advances\u0085 there are storm clouds on the horizon though; Japan is on the road to war and Jiro's planes are destined to play a key part in that self-created national disaster.I had put off watching this film for a long time as I didn't want there to be no new Miyazaki films to watch; having finally watched it I can say it was not in any way disappointing. This is Miyazaki's most grown up work and it doesn't shy away from tragedy; either personal of national. As one would expect from Studio Ghibli the animation is amazing. There are no static background characters; everybody is moving in a vibrant but not overly exaggerated manner. Not surprisingly the flying scenes are beautiful. The characters are interesting as are their stories; the fact that many items of Jiro's life as depicted in the film don't match reality doesn't matter as it doesn't claim to be a true record of what happened. This is one of Ghibli's more emotional films; only Isao Takahata's 'Grave of the Fireflies' is sadder at the end as this story doesn't shy away from showing the consequences of Jiro's aircraft designs or give us a happy ending to Naoko's story. Overall I'd say this was a great film; it might not have the universal appeal as Mayazaki's other films but it is a must see for older fans of his work and a fitting farewell to this master animator.",

            "content": "Aviation has always been a key element of the Studio Ghibli films; from the flying broomstick in Kiki's Delivery Service to the airborne armies in Howl's Moving Castle. So for Hayao Miyazaki's reported swan-song to focus on the development of aeroplane design is no surprise. A fictionalised biopic of designer Jiro Horikoshi, The Wind Rises is a stunning achievement, an animated film that uses the medium to tell a compelling, highly emotional story that has appeal for children and adults alike. Horikoshi's designs were used during World War 2, and that detail may make The Wind Rises unpalatable to some. But Miyazaki's films have never focused on battle-lines, but on the personal stories involved, and The Wind Rises gains power from the balancing of the beauty of the designs against the knowledge that the purpose for which the designs will be used leads to death and unhappiness. It's a bitter-sweet paradox, and one that many directors would sweep under the carpet. Instead, Miyazaki puts Horikoshi's dilemma centre-stage, and depicts the designer's angst as he finds himself immersed in industrial and international intrigue while he attempts to keep his own thinking pure. A subplot, invented for the film, relates how Horikoshi's work life is informed by his chaste romance with Naoko, a woman with tuberculosis who won't marry until she recovers. Horikoshi's dreams take flight while his day-to-day reality struggles to leave the ground behind. The Wind Rises stirs up sensational aerial dream sequences, but also captures the bleakness of life on the ground, as Tokyo recovers from a devastating earthquake. Horikoshi and Naoko journey to the Magic Mountain resort in an effort to address her physical malaise, and their interaction with a mysterious German spy, beautifully voiced by Werner Herzog, sketches out the sinister world of warmongering that forms the backdrop to their romance. Studio Ghibli films have always been beautiful to watch, and The Wind Rises excels in every frame. But the overriding message, about the role of a gifted individual to overcome the constraints of society, is just as beautifully wrought; The Wind Rises is required viewing for anyone who wants to have their spirits lifted and soar like the wind for two blissful hours.",

            "content": "Jir\u00f4 Horikoshi was born in 1903 and graduated from the newly established Aviation Laboratory within the Engineering Department of the University of Tokyo. He started his airplane design career with the Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Company Limited. In the late 1930s his team designed a prototype fighter plane completed in 1940, the year 2600 for the Japanese, thus it was named the \"00\" or better known to us as the \"Zero\" which was instrumental in WW2. This is a Japanese language movie but was also released in an English version. Joseph Gordon-Levitt provides the voice for Jir\u00f4 Horikoshi.The story itself is highly fictional. It depicts Jiro dreaming about flying from an early age, then as an engineer dreaming about his designs, including crashes in his dreams as he realized the flaws. The animation is old style and looks very good. The animated scenes are stunning. It is a very nice movie to look at. The story itself is for mature audiences, children will not generally appreciate it. It depicts Jiro as falling in love with a girl that the \"rising wind\" keeps getting them together. She was suffering from tuberculosis and had a short time to live but he married her anyway. In his real life he didn't have a younger sister, he had an older brother. His wife did not have tuberculosis and they had children.Much of this film shows the devastation of war, how Japan's ill- advised attack at Pearl Harbor in 1941 awakened the sleeping giant, resulting in much of Japan being destroyed. Jiro himself has been quoted as:\" When we awoke on the morning of December 8, 1941, we found ourselves \u2014 without any foreknowledge \u2014 to be embroiled in war...Since then, the majority of us who had truly understood the awesome industrial strength of the United States never really believed that Japan would win this war... But now, bereft of any strong government move to seek a diplomatic way out, we are being driven to doom. Japan is being destroyed. I cannot do (anything) other but to blame the military hierarchy and the blind politicians in power for dragging Japan into this hellish cauldron of defeat \"Very worthwhile movie.",

This movie had a great impact on me after seeing it in the theatre and I thought about what I had seen for the one hour drive home afterwards. In terms of pacing and how the movie focuses on the main character I was reminded of David Lean movies in its maturity and emotional grit. There were also times when watching that I thought to myself I have never seen hand drawn animation this good ever and will probably never see animation this good ever again. The character designs are beautiful. The backgrounds and color pallete are beautiful. The animation is breathtaking. But the story is just as beautiful as the artwork. The movie is about one mans journey to make beautiful airplanes but is also equally tragic in later scenes of the movie in the evolving love story and especially the last scene in the movie.This movie does not explain at any time through dialogue what the character is feeling but instead it shows you and the subtle and at times powerful emotions which are the glue of what holds his story together. Some people may wonder why Miyazaki took creative risks with the real life story of Jiro Hirikoshi. The real life Jiro never married to a woman with Tuberculosis. Did he really fantasize about building airplanes? Was he really followed by a Soviet Spy? I think the way the character fantasizes about airplanes even when not dreaming is an honest depiction of how creative people like Hayao Miyazaki think.Along with Porco Rosso this is probably Hayao Miyazaki's most personal movie. If you study Hayao Miyazaki's movies and read about his career like I have it becomes obvious that this movie is as much about Jiro Hirikoshi as it is about Hayao Miyazaki.I recommend anyone who has ever been creative to go see the Wind Rises.Hayao Miyazaki's Most Beautiful film.",

            "content": "I'm going to pull out all the stops as I'm trying to verbalize how mightily impressed I am with \"Kaze tachinu\" (2013), or \"The Wind Rises\". Miyazaki has now been at the top of his game for well over thirty years, and his latest and apparently last film is remarkable in all the usual modi operandi \u2013 luxuriant use and understanding of colour, extraordinary level of detail in even the most mundane-seeming particulars that make the scenes come to life, fantastical sense of the relationship between dreams and imagination and reality, and how the story stems from the images and extends to the world of the creator, and ours. The film tells the story of Horikoshi Jiro, a genius whose enthusing search for perfection makes him descend the dream-path laid down in his youth. A story of determination, the film is also a profound meditation on the forces of nature: Tokyo destroyed in the earthquake and by fire, the aircraft in shreds and pieces. The influence and inspiration given to Jiro by what only he seems to be able to see around him makes him the visionary that he is. Airplanes, trains, ships, radiators. The path to advance technology, first by exposure, then by imagination and invention. To be either Achilles, twenty years behind, or the tortoise. Filmmaking is very much the same: seeing the unseen, imagining that which has not been imagined. This is not compromise or pampering to the lowest common denominator, but art that goes all the way beyond our wildest dreams and is still able to describe the indescribable so lucidly we become enraptured and immediately converted.All the Miyazakis I've seen have some incredulously indelible moments without compare. Here there are several, including the utterly beautiful dreams, especially the wind, the opening five minutes in full, the remarkable sound design during the dreams and the earthquake, the water, the rain, and the flight.And speak of the wind! It has personality, it's brilliant and as powerful as in \"Ran\" (1985), \"Zerkalo\" (1975) or \"The Wind\" (1928), in some ways even more so because it's animated in ways impossible to achieve in live action. And the love that uncharacteristically seems to evade and elude, as it does in Wong Kar-Wai's \"Fa yeung nin wa\" (2000). She paints, and the picturesque mise en sc\u00e8ne and the atmosphere is comparable to \"Van Gogh\" (1991) and its languorous lushness. Then there's Thomas Mann's \"The Magic Mountain\" used by Castorp as an allegory for forgetting, yet the novel becomes real through Nahoko's illness and not as a token of forgetting but instead of never forgetting.And then there's the war. \"It flies like a dream\", the pilot says, thanking Jiro during the apparent climax of the film, and Miyazaki cuts to a scene of utter destruction, a cemetery of people, ideals, ideas and technology, a disaster not unlike the earthquake in the beginning, yet so tragically unlike.The name of the film comes from a quotation from Paul Val\u00e9ry, but refers to Ghibli: the name of the studio but also the engine of the aircraft in \"Porco Rosso\" (1992). It's a real engine used in an Italian aircraft during World War II, designed by the Caproni seen in the film. In a way, then, this is as natural a conclusion to Miyazaki's career as one could imagine: a flight of imagination, carried by the most powerful wind, and a shared dream of great minds that we are lucky to be invited in.",

The Wind Rises (2013) is Hayao Miyazaki's swan song and he could not have bowed out on a better note than this. Going from the TV series Future Boy Conan (1978) to TWR shows how Miyazaki's vision has changed and evolved over the years; it's a beautiful thing.A loose biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, this film is a gorgeously animated meditation on art, love, war, and social responsibility. It's grown-up tone and refusal to answer life's big questions make it so unlike the animated fare we are continually fed in the United States. If I didn't already hold nothing but contempt for the Oscars, I would be furious that it lost to Frozen (2013), which is a cute but underwhelming movie.Let's hope Disney will release this for the home video market soon. This movie would also make a great double-feature with Porco Rosso (1992), another Miyazaki film concerned with the rise of fascism before WWII, albeit done in a more light-hearted manner.",

This gives Miyazaki a chance to do stunning flying sequences (and landscapes) as well as other scenes.

            "content": "How do you even begin to talk about the final film from one of your favorite filmmakers to ever live? Japanese animation maestro, Hayao Miyazaki, has made some of the greatest animated films ever. From My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away, Miyazaki's imagination seemingly knows no bounds, so when he announced last Fall that The Wind Rises would be his last film before retirement, I immediately knew I had to see it on the biggest screen possible, no matter what. The Wind Rises is simply put, another Miyazaki masterpiece. If you are already a fan of his works, then you will love it, and even if this is your first taste, this very well might be the best place to start. The film tells the slightly fictionalized life story of one of Miyazaki's personal heroes, aeronautical engineer, Jiro Horikoshi. While Jiro is now more famously known as the man who built the Zero Fighter that the Japanese used to bomb Pearl Harbor, the real Jiro was a pacifist who only wanted to build something beautiful. The film follows Jiro from 1918 all the way through the start of World War II and details the sweet, yet tragic love story between him and his ailing wife, while also showing how Jiro was inspired to create the Zero Fighter.Upon seeing The Wind Rises, it's obvious why Miyazaki chose this particular story as his swan song, it features every major thematic idea of his various works all compiled into one narrative, and yet it is very different from any of his other films. Could Miyazaki have created another lavish fantasy adventure as his final film? He could have, and all of his fans would have watched it, but there's something special about The Wind Rises that makes it worth every ounce of salt in the world. Miyazaki's pacifism, his eccentricity, and his optimism are all on full display throughout the narrative, all represented through the eyes of Jiro and how he processes everything through vivid daydreams and his own quiet optimism.As far as the animation goes, the folks at Studio Ghibli have all done another marvelous job. The dream sequences, where Jiro envisions planes, are all some of the most gorgeous images Ghibli animators have ever drawn, and the way that the animators use wind, especially when dealing with any outdoor scene between Jiro and his wife, Nahoko, is simply stunning. There is an expressionistic flair to the wind that is very reminiscent to how Studio Ghibli approached the water in Ponyo. The wind feels alive and almost becomes a bit of an invisible puppeteer, often working as hard as the music to cue you into the emotions of the story. Speaking of the music, Miyazaki's longtime collaborator, composer Joe Hisaishi, has delivered another breathtaking score that manages to defy expectation with the Italian-inspired theme juxtaposed against the Japanese setting.I really can't say enough about The Wind Rises. Perhaps the film has so much resonance for me because I am such a huge Miyazaki fan (he ranks behind only Steven Spielberg in my book of favorite directors of all-time), but The Wind Rises truly is a sensational film as well. This is quite possibly the most romantic film Miyazaki has ever made, turning paper airplanes into a new form of love letter, while also delivering some of the most fully fleshed out characters Miyazaki has ever committed to film. Like all of Miyazaki's works, the characters are all slightly eccentric, funny, and extremely lovable, even in all of their flaws, but there is a depth to every character and their motivations, in particular Jiro and Nahoko, that is deeply moving.While The Wind Rises is not typical Miyazaki, the spirit of invention is still there in every frame, where you feel as if you are discovering a long lost epic from the Golden Age of Hollywood or something. That's actually how The Wind Rises feels to me. The Wind Rises is so simple, yet complex at the same time, and is consistently entertaining while being a movie you'll definitely want a hankie for. Thank you, Miyazaki-san, for this film and for a career that has inspired me so much.I give The Wind Rises a 10 out of 10!",

            "content": "The film is an interesting melange of Japanese literature, culture and history. It will also disappoint many of Miyazaki's fantasy fans, as this is a biographical movie. In truth, it is based on two different works, one is the diary of the aeronautical engineer who designed the famous Japanese Zero fighter, and the other is a story of two girls in a tuberculosis sanatorium (in truth, Jiro's wife did not have TBC).Yet the details capture also some of the things closer to Miyazaki's heart: a commentary on the current state of Japan, a hopeful dream for a person who is losing his sight and his passion for flying and for kind independent young women. All in all it might feel a little dry sometimes, but only until you understand that the source material was a diary that has 80% of it containing aeronautical design ideas and calculations.Perhaps a two hour film about a quiet dreamer of plane designs is not what I would have chosen for Miyazaki's last animation movie, but it wasn't my choice after all. While his artistic expression cannot be stopped - he is still drawing manga and doing other stuff - he publicly announced that this would be his last film, the reason being his worsening eyesight. Considering the first scene of the movie is of a myopic boy who dreams of flying a plane and then crashing because he can't see well, I would say that's a pretty direct statement from the genius animator.It doesn't matter if I recommend this movie or not. If you are a fan of Ghibli and Miyazaki you will watch it anyway, while if you are not, you can try some other stuff of his, become a die hard fan, and find yourself in a situation already solved previously (that's engineering humor, BTW)",

Hayao Miyazaki's latest movie The Wind Rises is one of his best movies till date though the story line and plot is completely different from all his other movies which had a magical and fantasy feeling to it. It's nowhere near Spirited Away his best work till date but it ranks 3rd in my ghibli list after Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. The story, partly non-fiction, evolves around a young mechanical designer whose dream was to build beautiful airplanes. He ultimately succeeds in building fully up-to-date planes, but which went to war, and none came back.His personal life is set in Japan when people were facing great uncertainty after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, and preparation for the war with China, then America, and Britain, and Netherlands, and the Soviets ... He and his colleagues do what they do best and what they are supposed to do under those circumstances: make planes. Just do it. His life enters into a new stage when he meets again accidentally with the girl whose life he saved during the earthquake. Their beautiful romance and eventual marriage is however overshadowed by her disease (tuberculosis, which was incurable at that time), and war.The ending completely pays off and blew me away in every term.

However, it is unbelievable even for me to write this but honestly, The Wind Rises (2013) is a boring, overrated movie from the renowned Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli. The Wind Rises (2013) has received critical acclaim and has been dubbed as the farewell masterpiece of the award winning director Hayao Miyazaki most likely out of respect or marketing strategies but if we truly analyse it, this piece is much inferior even compared to much lower budget foreign animated features especially in the storytelling department.If you are expecting an inspiring film, there could be some scenes that are inspiring. If you are sensitive, there could be some elements could upset you. Then, there is a good chance that this will not satisfy you at all if you are looking for a good romantic or drama film and even if this might appeal to those who are genuinely in love with everything aviation or engineering, they might just experience frustration as the whole film seems to be a series of underdeveloped scenes put together.Despite there are some deep messages in the The Wind Rises (2013), both the storyline and characters are very dull even with decent music and animation. Perhaps this is not intended for everyone and not everyone will enjoy this but as a record, I watch this with an open mind, with genuine interest and patience until the very end; it is sad to report that I believe I am watching a poor attempt at a biographical film filled with the littlest dose of drama, romance and war.

It is much more historical and 'reality-based' than many of the other Studio Ghibli fantastic classics like \"Spirited Away\" \"Princess Mononoke\" and the most recent \"The Tale of Princess Kaguya\"\"The Wind Rises\" is mostly based in the real World (i.e. 1930's Japan = specifically Tokyo) following the intriguing story of Jiro Horikoshi the brilliantly creative (and highly logical & inventive) aeronautical engineer/designer who is positively-obsessed with Air-flight and constantly thinks (and dreams) about developing the best/ most efficiently aerodynamic (and even 'artistic') means for giving human beings workable 'wings' in order to soar toward the heavens!Although Jiro is essentially a rational/practical aeronautical engineer, he is also motivated (and sometimes even haunted) by powerfully-vibrant and colorful 'Dreams' of fantastic-flight, although occasionally the dreams turn to nightmares in mid-stream (sort of akin to 'Life' itself)Part of what makes \"The Wind Rises\" truly amazing is the absolute-beauty of Hayao Miyazaki's meticulously-imaginative animation layouts & designs = these were obviously done by hand with much care (and much 'heart') as the scenes and characters vibrantly 'come-to-Life' recreating/ and powerfully evoking the period in Tokyo during the 1930's when Japanese Society was really at the crossroads = rapidly assimilating Western attire, culture and especially technology - looking towards the future (just prior to the dark period when Japan's overly-ambitious-expansionist-militarism would hold-sway and inflict senseless destruction on the World ==> this WWII destruction eventually ironically coming full-circle and inflicting enormous pain & death upon Japan itself, especially ravaging Tokyo)There are intensely artistic (and amazingly realistic) scenes not only of miraculous air flight, but also of rapidly-chugging trains, beautiful rainstorms, and numerous intriguing lighting-effects (i.e. with shadows & light perceptibly changing between dawn to dusk - and every time-frame in between - Miyazaki should have won the Best Cinematography Oscar Award!)Hayao Miyazaki's 'swan-song' (as people like to say since he announced retirement a couple years ago) is a meticulously rendered, intensely-artistic (and highly-moving) 'Labor-of-love' that reflects the same ultra-high-Level of artistic-intellectual commitment to the maximum standards of human Creativity = completely honoring the similar dedication to 'creative-perfection' exhibited by this movie's protagonist: engineer, airplane designer & dreamer Jiro Horikoshi = whose brilliant innovations led to creation of the fearsomely-formidable Mitsubishi 'Zero' fighter (used as deadly weapon of War and aggression, that ultimately brought horrific destruction/ retribution upon Japan itself) = representing the quintessential & perfect 'dream' turned to nightmarenote: it has been documented that the real-Life Jiro Horikoshi was actually quite skeptical of the Japanese military's expansionist-ambitions, and did not believe that Japan could ultimately prevail against America's huge industrial-potential, and that the War with America and Allies would prove futile in the end - but to this day, the amazingly advanced-design (for its time) of Horikoshi's 'Zero' fighter-plane is still highly-regarded as a true marvel of visionary aeronautical engineering & productionnote2: It is also quite moving the way this film sometimes sways between 'reality' and fantasy. Jiro's 'dreams' are oftentimes quite insightful - particularly towards the end when he sees his sublimely-beautiful wife Nahoko again (who passed away from tuberculosis just prior to WWII) - she imparts lasting-indelible words of wisdom & enduring love.",

Its story of an obsessively brilliant young man given to dreaming extravagant dreams and then actually realizing those dreams is timeless. When viewed purely as a cinematic experience, \"The Wind Rises\" is an achievement of a very high order.Unfortunately, the film has two significant flaws. First, the handling of the character of the movie's protagonist, Jiro Horikoshi, is regrettable. Jiro is portrayed in uniquely heroic terms. From an early age, we see him acting with the utmost virtue under any and all circumstances -- rescuing young children from bullying, carrying a woman for miles and miles on his back in the aftermath of an earthquake, etc. Given the complexity of the animation, this oversimplification of Jiro's character is jarring and his portrayal sometimes becomes mawkishly sentimental and irritating.More significantly, this film glorifies the work and life of a designer of military airplanes that were used to kill many thousands of people. In scene after scene, the Japanese military-industrial complex of the 1930s is portrayed as employing a wonderfully sincere and good-natured group of men who were ready to roll up their shirtsleeves and work day and night to build \"beautiful planes.\" The passing references to what those planes would be used to do, to the devastation of war, are noticeable but have little impact on the viewer. Bathed in the warm glow of Miyazaki's incredible animation, the audience feels the few brief references to war and devastation as if they were mild bumps on a very smooth airplane flight.The scenes of Jiro and his colleagues when they visit pre-war Germany are quite telling in this regard. Although the scenes in Germany do include some highly controlling German behavior, as well as a scene of someone being pursued at night by a gang of well-dressed thugs, not one single swastika is shown during perhaps 20 minutes of footage. The word \"Nazi\" is never uttered. Although the name \"Mr. Hitler\" is uttered much later in the film during a conversation Jiro has with a German at a Japanese resort -- the man has a very large nose and is perhaps a regrettable caricature of a Jewish person -- the name \"Mr. Hitler\" is spoken only once and with complete neutrality, as if Jiro is saying the name \"Mr. Smith.\"This movie's brief allusions to wartime devastation and its omission of any mention of Japan and Germany's heinous ideologies greatly compromised my experience. It portrays Jiro, an enabler of terrible worldwide aggression, in the most heroic and reverent terms. If for domestic Japanese political or commercial reasons Miyazaki could not offer a more realistic and balanced story of Japan's preparations for, and its predations during, World War II, then he should have chosen a different subject for his film. This comic book fantasy-adventure left me angry and sad, and for all the wrong reasons.",

The characters are all so alive, and the parts of the movie where Jir\u00f4 is adventuring, and learning are a lot of fun.

            "content": "This film is not recommended.Filmmaker Hayeo Miyazaki's last animated film, The Wind Rises, tells the real-life story of Jiro Horikoshi, an engineer and designer of Japanese fighter planes during World War II. Drawn in the anime style with its stylized detail and realistic backgrounds, the film plays like a historical biography and doesn't shy away from its adult storyline. This is a serious-minded animated film for adults which never panders to a younger audience. There are no happy songs, cute characters, or overblown theatrics involved. There is also no excitement, joy, or any semblance of emotional connection. The heavy-handed story continually weighs the film down even if the film's artistic inventiveness is, at times, buoyant and quite lovely to behold.Miyazaki's vision is known for his whimsical and other worldly themes as in films like My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, and Spirited Away. Here he stays mostly grounded in realism due to the screenplay that goes through the paces of this man's life. Whereas in his past efforts, Miyazaki's films were populated with strange creatures in a\u00a0fascinating surreal world that enchanted viewers with his unique poetic viewpoint, those trademark bizarre and mystical creatures are nowhere to be found. In The Wind Rises, the acclaimed animator\u00a0is now tether to the real world with only occasional flights of fantasy in the form of Jiro's dreams to free Miyazaki's creative imagination and engage his audience. His storytelling grounds the film for all the wrong reasons and the film never soars. The film is a disappointment, a film so conventional and boringly told, sidestepping important details about the main character's obsessive work with new models of fighter planes that actually were used at the Pearl Harbor invasion, a fact never mentioned.A tender love story of Jiro and Nahoko, ably voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt, becomes a more interesting subplot. But weak voice-over work by an all-star cast nearly sabotages the film. The dialog is barely passable, with too much over-emoting by Mandy Patinkin, John Krasinski, Elijah Wood, William H. Macy, and Jennifer Grey. Even worse are some characters that become racial stereotypes of Italian (Stanley Tucci), German (Werner Herzog), and Japanese ethnic groups, both in tone with the actors' heavy accents and in the physical caricatures as they are artistically rendered. (In fact, one character, Mr. Kurokawa, is so overplayed by Martin Short that it becomes a borderline offensive parody onto itself. (That character is so reminiscent of Mickey Rooney's political incorrect interpretation of I.Y. Yunioshi from Breakfast at Tiffany that I was gobsmacked at its disturbing comparison.)Artistically, there is so much to admire with the visual look of the film but not much to really get excited about. Besides its sluggish plotting, the film mixes too many styles that just don't mesh very well: detailed hand drawn linear contours with rich pastel colors, painterly watercolor washed settings that create wonderful atmospheric\u00a0effects, but are impressive computer generated imagery that, nevertheless, is jarringly misapplied. The anime facial features are indistinctive and lacking depth, especially when placed in the real-life environs of the true story being told.Horikoshi was once quoted to have said, \" All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful.\" Miyazaki has done so with The Wind Rises. The director has crafted a beautiful looking film as his swan song. Too bad the overall effect of the film seemed emotionally inert to me.

            "content": "This film in many respects is a fitting way for Hayao Miyazaki to say goodbye to animation and Studio Ghibli...The animation is the studios best to date, and the sentimentality of his characters is heartfelt and effective without being cliche. The narrative concerning Jiro Horikoshi is some of his best work, and should be considered a masterpiece of his non fantasy work.Whilst the film follows the story of Jiro and his aviation designs, eventuating in the design of the legendary Japanese fighter plane, the Zero. The film does have a continual subtle anti-war theme, with many a comment made that the aircraft designers want to do just that, design aircraft, not make machines of war. The final scene of the film, in that regard is heartbreaking.The film does also cover Jiro's meeting and subsequent relationship with Naoko Satomi, who later became his wife. The film does spend some time on that relationship, although it still feels like it plays second fiddle to Jiro's passion. It's that imbalance with the film, which is the only criticism I have, there is of course poetic license with the biographical tale but we can overlook that.A wonderful way for Studio Ghibli to look back on a period of change in Japanese history, without focusing on the darker details, but by celebrating in a rather melancholy manner one of its great design innovators. A great film and a great way for Hayao Miyazaki to sign off.",

            "content": "I watched this movie yesterday night, on the International Cinema Festival here in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. This movie is astonishing. It really feels lie a good-bye movie, but that is not what makes it sad. Although the movie is uplifting, colourful and with an amazing music score... it is quite sad to think that Grave of the Fireflies happened just a few years later! This movie is deliciously colourful. We can also see Miyazaki's style on the characters. They actually do the Totoro's head size changing thing when expressing strong emotions. One of the things that I really liked was the music score. It starts as a simple guitar, but in the end it evolves to a full orchestra. The sound effects are quite amazing as well. I felt that the Germany part of the movie was a tad slow, and some parts could be more developed, such as the flashligh part of the movie. This is a bit annoying, but is soon forgotten. The mixture between dreams and reality is delicious. I felt happy and warm inside watching all the happy people riding Caproni's plane. But in the same time... I felt sad, because, as I wrote above... this would all end in a few years or months. It is disturbing that the Zero would be used as a weapon and that many would not return. It is funny - the movie makes you feel good and uneasy on the same time. Still, this was one of the most gorgeous animation's I have ever seen. Mr. Miyazaki finished his career with a great movie, and his work sure be missed.",

            "content": "This is an animated feature written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and done by Studio Ghibli. There will be spoilers ahead:This is a highly fictionalized film about Jiro Horikoshi, an aeronautical engineer who designed fighter planes for Japan, including the Zero. Jiro's personal life is highly fictionalized in the film, but that scarcely matters.The film is just beautiful from start to finish. The animation, the backgrounds, the character design, the music, the dream sequences, the editing, the film is truly a work of art.Jiro's dream is to build beautiful planes. That they will be used for destructive purposes troubles him, but he designs planes for the same reason he breathes-because he has to do so. He's a brilliant engineer born to design planes. Repeatedly, he slips into dreams, some during sleep, some as daydreams and the dreams are beautiful. The plot flows smoothly, the fictionalized story of his personal life is to provide some additional drama and romance.While I liked Frozen and thought it was an excellent film on its own merits, I think this deserved to win the Academy Award for Animated Feature instead. Oh well, such is life. They're both worthy works.This is available on DVD and Blu-Ray and is absolutely breathtaking, particularly on Blu-Ray. Most highly recommended.",

I have seen films released in 1986 (Laputa) to 2013 (The Wind Rises) and the beauty of the films has not decreased in 27 years. That's a long time to be consistent and I appreciate Studio Ghibli to still be producing films of such quality.I first watched The Wind Rises just after watching Grave of the fireflies (which is a great movie itself) and therefore could not appreciate the film to that extent. Having recovered from Grave of the fireflies after about 2 weeks, I watched the film again and was astounded. And since then, I have watched the film 3 more times. The magic doesn't seem to fade. Its still there.And what a soundtrack. It is the best of all Ghibli/Miyazaki Films and whatever credit you give to Joe Hisaishi, it is still less. The music is stuck in my head since then and with the same intensity. I can not overemphasize the beauty of this film. There are a lot of strong moments, moments which will persist even after a long time. You feel like you have gone back to childhood. There are a lot of themes touched. Love, Sacrifice, Regret, Determination to name a few. Its more of an experience than a film. Its a tribute to Flight and Animation and if its to be Mr. Miyazaki's swan song, then it is fitting enough be considered one of his if not the best. There are not a lot of things you can call beautiful, but this surely is... Great work!!!",

So my first reaction to the Wind Rises is one of relief. While not at the level of his best films, like Spirited away and My Neighbor Toturo, this is an absolutely lovely movie, and as visually stunning as anything Miyazaki has produced.Outside of a few dream sequences, there is nothing fantastical about this film, which instead follows the career of a genial and impassioned aircraft designer in the years that preceded World War II. Visually the film is stunning. There are amazing moments, like an earthquake or a sudden rainstorm, that are startling in their strange beauty. While the story is generally engrossing though, it is also problematic. Not all characters integrate well into the narrative, particularly a rather mysterious German. An episodic structure creates an uneven flow. The lengthy movie overstays its welcome by about 20 minutes. And the whole idea of somewhat innocently creating something used so horribly rings a little false. Even though it lacks the fantasy elements of Miyazaki's best films, and even though this is not one of his best scripts (films like Ponyo and Arietty suggest that regardless of his filmmaker skills, his writing skills are weakening), overall this is just a lovely movie full of terrific moments.",

Basically it tells the true story of Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed Japanese fighter planes during World War II. As a young boy, Jir\u00f4 (Zach Callison) dreamed of flying and designing beautiful aeroplanes, he was inspired by the famous Italian aeronautical designer Giovanni Battista Caproni (Stanley Tucci), he has a dream about meeting him. Unfortunately Jiro's nearsightedness from a young age prevented him from becoming a pilot, but in his dream, Caproni told him he never actually flew a plane in his life, and that building them is better. When he grows up, Jir\u00f4 Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) joins a major Japanese engineering company and becomes one of the world's most innovative and accomplished aeroplane designers, including the design for the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The story sees him going through his own life, as well as experiencing historical events of the time, including the Great Kanto Earthquake, the Great Depression, the tuberculosis epidemic and Japan plunged into the Second World War. It also sees Jiro falling in love with Nahoko (Emily Blunt), who suffers tuberculosis and a lung haemorrhage, but eventually recovers and marries him, and it also sees his cherished friendship with his colleague Honj\u00f4 (John Krasinski). Also starring Martin Short as Kurokawa, Mandy Patinkin as Hattori, Mae Whitman as Kayo Horikoshi, Jennifer Grey as Mrs. Kurokawa, William H. Macy as Satomi, Elijah Wood as Sone and Werner Herzog as Castorp. The stars doing the dubbed voices are all fine, there is no denying it is fantastic hand-drawn animation as usual, I'm not sure if going for a more realistic approach is right for the studio, we are more used to the fantasy stories with fantastical creatures, but it is just about interesting, an alright animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Worth watching!",

No, what disappointed me about THE WIND RISES is the romantic sub-plot, that takes up a large part of the film. It's not twee and sickly sweet like in a Disney animation, but I did find it unnecessary and these scenes really dragged the pacing down.

This is a fictionalised biopic on Jiro who was famed for designing one of the most accomplished airplanes ever that were used in the Second World War. This area of the biopic was fascinating, only a pioneer like Miyazaki could make a film about engineering innovative and compelling. The other area of the film was his romance with a young lady named Nahoko. Which, again, was tender and beautiful to watch as their relationship blossomed. The problem is, the two do not match at all and so the overall plot and story is somewhat unfocused. Consistently jumping back and forth between his career and love life, the two just didn't marinate together as a narrative. More importantly, like with any Studio Ghibli production, the animation is absolutely beautiful. Colourful, vibrant and with fluid motion, I was transported into Miyazaki's vision. I loved Jiro's dream sequences which gave Miyazaki a chance to show some fantasy elements that he is all too famous for. The character of Jiro himself was well developed. Summed up easily as a Good Samaritan, a helpful chap who was career minded and aspired to be great. I found him to be relatable and likeable. The film includes many of Japan's historic events such as The Great Kanto earthquake, Second World War and the epidemic of tuberculosis. These are dealt with gently and intelligently. It might look like the film is aimed for the younger audience, but if you look deeper it is a far more humanistic drama about aspiration and inspiration. Can definitely appeal to the more mature audience. Also liked the English dub, thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt was well cast as the voice of Jiro. Oh, and the musical score was tremendous, particularly the more heartfelt softer pieces of music. So whilst this might not be Miyazaki's best work, it still is a beautiful, compelling and engrossing animated feature.",

He is born to a rich family, gets his dream job at a first-class company without any struggle whatsoever, and is soon given a chance to study abroad in Germany and keeps pursuing his dream of designing a \"beautiful plane\".This was a time when young men were forced to die in the battlefields, never allowed to even have a dream except dying for the country, while the only real difficulty the protagonist faced that I could personally relate to was the fact that his wife was dying (and it was still very difficult to understand why he fell in love with his wife in the first place).The first half of the movie was a slow paced story about a man who pursued his dream without having to face any difficulty interesting enough to observe.

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is a review of the Japanese language version.Hayao Miyazaki is one of the greats of Japanese cinema, making many classic animated films. He is bowing out of filmmaking with his final film, a fictionalised story about aircraft designer Jiro Horikoshi.As a young boy Jiro (Hideaki Anno) dreams of flying and making an aircraft, using his talents to design the Zero fighter despite the limits of the technology as Japan becomes more industrial and militarised. As his professional life goes from strength to strength Jiro forms a relationship with a young woman, Naoko Satomi (Miori Takimoto).As expected from a Miyazaki film the animation is of highest quality, being both detailed and imaginative, a talented voice cast, emotional characters and a brilliant music score. Though there are some dream sequences, The Wind Rises is a mostly grounded affair as Jiro wants success in his career and tells a more serious, melodramatic story. There is little humour, with the comic relief coming from Jiro's boss, Kurokawa (Masahiko Nishimura) who has a particularly funny line near the end of the film.The Wind Rises is set over a long period, from 1918 to the 1930s and Miyazaki shows the changing socio-economics of Japan in this period. Buildings, technology, transport and even fashion change in this period. There are juxtapositions of the modern and the traditional, people either wearing Western suits or traditional Japanese dress, the contrast of the railways to people using horse and carts in rural areas, people moving from the countryside to the cities and even the use of oxens to transport planes to the airfield. The Wind Rises shows Japan as a developing country and the social issues it was suffering.The sequence of the Great Kant Earthquake is superbly done, showing the affects of the fire on Tokyo, the displacement of people and the panic it caused, reminiscent of The Impossible. The side effect of the event was it allowed Tokyo to modernise, redevelop and become a European like city.Miyazaki's anti-war politics is prevalent throughout this film, coming in many forms. There are debates about the military-industrial complex with the money being spend on Japan's armed forces whilst people are living in poverty and foreshadowing of the upcoming war Japan is about to face. Hindsight is a wonderful gift. There are visual realisations of this showing dream sequences of fire bombings, being a sign of the future aerial warfare and its effects, particularly on Japan.Yet Miyazaki does add some moral greys as characters do debate that great things come from suffering and some of humanity's greatest advances have come as a by-product of warfare.It is a great shame that Miyazaki has chosen to retire as he is a fantastic filmmaker who has made some truly wonderful films during his career. The Wind Rises is sombre, interesting film telling the story of a man's passion for both his craft and his love, but it does not join the heights of Miyazaki's filmography.3.5/5Please visit www.rocknreelreviews.com",

            "content": "Studio Ghibli gets serious in this romanticized take on avionic design at the dawn of the second world war. Engineering might seem a strange subject for animation, and at times it is, but in typical fashion the studio delights in writing their own rules and somehow coming out ahead. In the same way that recent big-budget live action cinema has been trying to draw inspiration from animation's more fantastical elements, it seems that The Wind Rises borrows its mundane, grounding elements from reality. Detail has always been a calling card for Miyazaki's efforts, and here the old master has again outdone himself. The screen is flooded with life, with even the least remarkable background extra, almost-inanimate object, or stunning, towering cloudscape enjoying an unusual amount of motion and character - notes clearly taken from live action. There's no shortage of the studio's usual breathtaking flights of fancy and wonder, either, but now they're tempered by that basis in reality. And, in a way, that makes them even more special. Dreams intertwine with lucidity so casually, it's tough to identify the moments of transition. The plot is less rigid than one might expect, too, strolling along at its own pace and lazily floating from one decade to the next. That makes it less gripping than the standard Ghibli effort, but we're invested in different ways. Gorgeous, poetic, relaxing, inspiring, warm and funny and bittersweet; it's not at all what I expected, and no competition for Totoro or Mononoke or Spirited Away, but it's not trying to be.",

            "content": "2013's \"The Wind Rises\" is a magnificent piece of Japanese animation, or Anime' (for the uninitiated). In what may be one of the rare films of this type, \"The Wind Rises\" is a unique mix of biopic, historical drama, romance, and fantasy. It tells the story of an enthusiastic dreamer who is able to realize many of his life's greatest ambitions, but unfortunately lives to see his genius and the fruits of his labor later give way to a dawning nightmare.Thankfully, although the film doesn't descend into pointless political arguments and finger-pointing and questioning the morality of its lead character, \"The Wind Rises\" does recognize that its central protagonist can feel the winds of change upon him and the moral conflict he will eventually find himself in.\"The Wind Rises\" is, of course, the final film of legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki - who wrote and directed the film, which was partially inspired by the 1937 short story \"The Wind Has Risen\" by Tatsuo Hori and which Miyazaki then adapted into a Manga series - who retired from filmmaking in September of 2013. \"The Wind Rises\" didn't hit American shores until February of the following year; I had plans to see the film in the theaters, but I unfortunately never got the opportunity. Two years later, I finally got the chance to sit down and watch this fantastical masterpiece of Japanese Anime'.The film is different from his past masterworks like \"Spirited Away\" (2001) (my personal favorite Miyazaki film ever), \"Princess Mononoke\" (1997) or his last film before this one, \"Ponyo\" (2008). While there is fantasy here, it's mixed in with Japanese history, which may turn away some young viewers and anyone still accustomed to his usual fantasy work. But it's still a brilliant exercise in animated storytelling.And yet, despite its brilliance, this film did cause a controversy in its native Japan, due to its subject matter - the late Japanese aeronautical engineer Dr. Jiro Horikoshi (June 22, 1903-January 11, 1982), who, of course, was the man who designed and built the much-feared Mitsubishi A6M Zero attack fighter plane, which was used by Japanese kamikaze pilots in World War II. Miyazaki was attacked by the political Right AND Left in Japan for making a film that supposedly glorified war - which does not look good for a nation that is still dealing with the physical and psychological traumas of its wartime aggression and brutality against its enemies 71 years after that war's official conclusion - as well as negative comments he'd made about attempts to revise Japan's 1947 Allied-drafted, post-WWII pacifist constitution.Miyazaki, of course, is an out-spoken pacifist who condemned his country's actions during World War II (even though Miyazaki was only four-years-old at the time of Japan's surrender in 1945). His film does not glorify war, but it does nonetheless take a very sympathetic view of a complex individual, one who was morally opposed to war and objected to his work being misused for such destructive purposes - as tools of war - but was ultimately powerless to do anything about the reckless and foolish, self-destructive actions of his government and military. But like I said earlier, Miyazaki's film is not a political statement, but a heartfelt portrait of a man striving to live his dreams and create art - which sort of mirrors the fact that \"The Wind Rises\" was a dream project of Miyazaki himself, who has been a warplane enthusiast since childhood and whose father's company made rudders for the Zero attack fighters during the war.Idealistic and driven, Jiro Horikoshi (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the English-language version) just wants to design and build airplanes, since his nearsightedness dashes his dreams of ever becoming a pilot. With his close friend Hiro Konjo (voiced by John Krasinski), they set to work building planes to be used by the Japanese Imperial Navy. Jiro's life and work are inter-cut with dreams of his hero, Italian aeronautical engineer Count Giovanni Battista Caproni (voiced by Stanley Tucci), who states that he has never flown a plane in his life, but building them is much better than actually flying them. (Caproni also ominously states that his planes are being used by the military for war purposes, and that many of these planes and their pilots will never come back from their missions.)Jiro's professional achievements are mirrored by the love and support of his one true love, Nahoko Satomi (voiced by Emily Blunt), whom he first meets in the aftermath of the great 1923 Kanto Earthquake, which devastated Japan and had a terrible effect on its already-struggling economy.\"The Wind Rises\" is a fantastic animated film that treats its subject matter with dignity and respect. Like I stated earlier, the film never becomes political, but nonetheless it's filled with foreboding with major events in world history about to unfold. Even for me while watching it, the characters can see that a great change is coming just over the horizon, and for those of us that know world history, Miyazaki places a number of omens in \"The Wind Rises\" to show that in just a few short years a great and terrible calamity is about to befall the people of Japan (and the rest of the world, for that matter) - World War II.If \"The Wind Rises\" truly is the last masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki, I honestly cannot think of a greater send-off to a living legend. This had all the earmarks of the last work of a master filmmaker and animator - perhaps the ultimate culmination of over four decades of one critically acclaimed animated feature after another.10/10P.S.: The 1973 song \"Hikoki-Gumo\" by Yumi Arai, which is featured prominently in the film and theatrical trailer, is simply amazing!\"All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful\" - Dr. Jiro Horikoshi",

            "content": "I must admit that I stopped watching animated films since elementary school; hence my knowledge of Miyazaki's filmography is minimal. The only Hayao Miyazaki films I am familiar with are Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro. Castle in the Sky remains my favorite. But perhaps I can lend an outsider's perspective. Adapted from his own manga, The Wind Rises is a fictionalized account of the life of Jiro Horikoshi, the aircraft designer of the Mitsubishi A5M and A6M Zero, two fighters that were used in World War II. Jiro's story spans from his childhood all the way to adulthood, covering Jiro's employment for the airplane manufacturer during WWII and the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, where he meets Naoko, who he later falls in love with.With its Monet-like skies and lush renditions of historical landscapes, the animation, particularly in Jiro's dream sequences, is gorgeous. I had forgotten how lifelike Miyazaki's characters move and behave. I recommend seeing this film in a theater if it is available, as much of the fun is losing yourself in the animated world.The historical context evokes unsettling memories in the segment set in Nazi Germany. The grand romanticism of the animation and Jiro's pursuit of becoming an aircraft designer just seem trivial placed against the events of WWII.The story is glacially paced, and without any fantastical elements or a villain, children will be bored. Dreamers make great characters, but I doubt Jiro Horikoshi will be on any fan's list of top ten Miyazaki's protagonists. I assume fans might expect something epic and fantastical for Miyazaki's last film, and he does not seem to be in any way interested in doing that.Hayao Miyazaki's family manufactured metal parts that went into the A6M Zero fighter airplane designed by the real-life Jiro Horikoshi, and there is a heavy sense of autobiographical elements of an author accessing his legacy by revisiting his roots. Miyazaki has chosen to make his farewell by telling a story about dreams and man's pursuit of them. In life, we may achieve our dreams, but not in the way we want to achieve them. But in the end, it's important not to drivel in perfections and appreciate what you have.Perhaps Miyazaki is delivering this message to himself, in the context to his retirement, but it is a poignant way to say farewell no less. Prepare the tissues or a faux man cough, because if you go along with the story patiently, it is a touching message that is said with heart.",

            "content": "The Wind Rises (Miyazaki, 2013): Japan Reviewed by Larry Gleeson. Viewed at the AFI Filmfest 2013.\"The Wind Rises,\" is a new animated, full-length, feature film from legendary Japanese animation director, Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki announced at this year's Venice Film Festival this will be his last film. In 1997 his \"Princess Mononoke,\" was the highest revenue grossing film in the history of Japan at the time of its release and it also received the Japanese equivalent of an Academy Award for Best Film. Miyazaki is also well known for the films \"Spirited Away,\" (2001) and \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" (2004) In 2003 Miyazaki received an Oscar for Best Animated Feature for the film \"Spirited Away,\" His films have garnered international acclaim from critics and have provided Miyazaki public recognition within Japan. His films are known for compelling characters, engaging plots and eye-catching animation. Remarkable by today's standards his films allow no more than 10% of the footage to come from computer animation.In \"The Wind Rises,\" Miyazaki tells the story of Jiro Horikoshi, a real-life aeronautical engineer who designed fighter aircraft in Japan during WWII. The film opens with the young Jiro fantasizing of his plane flying above his hometown. As I watched the scene unfold, a rather powerful ominous feeling surfaced as I was reminded of Leni Riefenstahl's opening scene from the Nazi propaganda documentary, \"Triumph of the Will.\" Nevertheless the early moments of the film are very heartwarming as Miyazaki chooses to highlight Jiro's youth as an older brother to a delightfully spirited younger sister in a single parented household run by their kind and caring mother.Jiro's passion throughout the film is making good airplanes. Jiro's daydreaming, which he does a few times during the story's arc. Admittedly, several of my favorite moments are Jiro's imaginings with Count Caproni, a larger-than-life mustachioed Italian airplane designer who mentors Jiro with playful and good natured ribbing, and provide insight into Jiro's creative passion. Jiro finds his inspiration through such moments and Miyazaki makes space for them throughout the film.The story is partially based on Tatsuo Hori's 1938 novelette, \"The Wind Has Risen.\" Miyazaki's animation provides beautiful plush scenery with Monet-like backdrops and landscapes providing striking visuals while creating a powerful nostalgia for a simpler time lightly brushing over the complications of war and economic depression. With such a breathtaking mise-en-scene it's no wonder a young Jiro falls in love with the young woman he saved during a traumatic, historic earthquake a few years before (the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake). In direct juxtaposition to this frantic and rather manic scenario in the aftermath of the earthquake, young Jiro finds himself vacationing in a rural setting enjoying the greenery and the soft \"rising\" winds complete with majestic and billowing, flowery clouds when he coincidentally crosses paths with the beautiful girl he saved from the earthquake as she paints poetically on a hillside overlooking the spectacular countryside.\"The Wind Rises,\" is a very light-hearted film, entertaining film. The film focuses pretty much exclusively on the protagonist, Jiro as an idealistic engineer whose primary purpose in life is to make planes. Granted, he falls in love and rubs elbows with German plane builders during WWII. Yet, WWII and the social unrest after the Great Kanto Earthquake are left virtually untouched. Tellingly, Jiro's concern at the end of the war was over the planes that didn't come back. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly recommend the film for children and for adults with a penchant for Monet-esque visuals.",

            "content": "As a fan of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, The Wind Rises is not one of their best(Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, Castle in the Sky, Whisper of the Heart), let down by some overly-languid pacing and some wooden voice-work from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It is however a great and beautiful film and quite easily along with Disney's Frozen one of the best animated films of 2013.The best thing about The Wind Rises is the animation, if there was one word to sum it up it would be exquisite. It is filled with Ghibli's characteristic meticulous and loving attention to detail, and it's not just luscious in colour and elegantly smooth in background art but it is also incredibly expressive. Joe Hisaishi's music score is also stunning, ethereally orchestrated and nimble in mood, it's also thankfully the antithesis of over-bearing, the gentle approach it has gives the film intimacy. The script is thoughtful and never preachy, and it doesn't get complicated either and the story while languidly paced and not the most imaginative that Miyazaki and Ghibli have come up with is very personal, charming and very affectionate. I did find myself very moved by the ending, then again this is hardly the first time where this viewer has gotten emotional watching a film. The reason for this being that the film deals with some very personal issues and explores them so movingly and mind-hauntingly. Miyazaki's direction is nuanced and intricate, the characters are engaging if more in the supporting roles than the leads(Caproni being the most memorable). The voice acting is quite good, though one of Ghibli's weakest dubbed films, reservations are had about Levitt but Emily Blunt is very compassionate and Martin Short, Mae Whitman and especially Stanley Tucci stand out in roles that all three give a lot of personality to.All in all, Ghibli and Miyazaki have done better, but The Wind Rises is still a great film, one of the best animated films of 2013, and a beautiful \"swan song\" from Miyzaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I found it to be very touching and poignant, as to be expected from anything by Studio Ghibli and the animation was, as always, breathtaking. While it's not my favourite of Miyazaki's movies, it's certainly one of his most beautiful to look at.The film is a fictionalised biopic about Jiro Horikoshi, designer of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter aircraft used by the Japanese during World War II. Since he was a child, Jiro had dreamed of being a fighter pilot, but due to his poor eyesight he was unable to follow through on it. After reading a magazine on aviation, he becomes interested in designing aircraft when he dreams one night that he meets the famous Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni, who tells him that it is better to build planes rather than flying them. As a result, Jiro then vows to become an aircraft engineer.Like with every Studio Ghibli film, there's a certain hard-to-describe artistic beauty about this movie. A lot of time and effort has gone into telling this story and it definitely shows. It is a fitting retirement piece for the legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki.I rate it 8/10 and would definitely recommend it to any fan of Studio Ghibli and fans of animation in general.",

            "content": "After being slightly disappointed by Howl's Moving Castle, I became a little worried lest Spirited Away is the last film in which Hayao Miyazaki managed to balance between telling a cohesive story and conveying passionate feelings. Without seeing 2008's Ponyo, I can gladly say that all my worries were for naught.Of course, It's essentially a biopic. And its moments of fantasy are only dreams and visions. But that doesn't mean that this made it an easier task for Miyazaki to prove that he hasn't lost his magic touch. That also in no way means that this film lacks the sense of wonder and the mesmerising animation Miyazaki's works are known for. IMHO, this is one of his most beautiful films, and one of the most beautiful animated films in general.Sure, this film could have simplified what concerns aeronautics to make this part more appealing to those who have no interest in such thing (like me). Also, it could have took more risks to differentiate itself from other biopics. But then again, I have these issues because I consider this a solid biopic, not an inspirational animated film.When it comes to the romance aspect of the film, it's safe to say that The Wind Rises has one of the most touching love stories I've witnessed in any animated feature. The conditions the lovers experience play a major part here; how their relationship has been established and develops throughout the film is what made this romance nearly on par with WALL\u00b7E's (only considering it's also an animated film).You may have noticed how much I identified with the characters. Actually, Jir\u00f4 Horikoshi became one of my favourite Miyazaki characters alongside Chihiro and Totoro.All in all, The Wind Rises is a top-tierMiyazaki that was begging not to be his swan song. Miyazaki's latest work is also, surprisingly, his most mature.(8.5/10)",

The movie goes in depth with Jiro's love for aviation in his dreams. These dream scenes are wild and showcase the creativity in Studio Ghibli.

At around two hours of running time, The Wind Rises tries to tackle Jiro's childhood all the way to his country becoming destroyed. There were many topics for this movie to cover and The Wind Rises mostly succeeds. It is the smaller details where the movie falters. The scenes skip many years and months as time goes on and this is not reflected by the characters. This is one aspect that could have been improved in the movie.

            "content": "In what is sadly the swansong of the animation legend Hayao Miyazaki, he tells the story of Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed fighter planes in World War II. The Wind Rises certainly goes beyond that simple premise and is a devastatingly powerful and beautifully bittersweet movie which outshines everything animated from 2013 (Yes, including Frozen) by a clear mile. The Wind Rises suffers a little from an excessive running time and at times it feels like there's not enough conflict in the story to justify the length, so it could feel style over substance to some. The Wind Rises doesn't have a lot of emphasis on plot however, and is a powerful character study, a moving love story and a tribute to aircraft all rolled into a stunning whole. There's still plenty of deep emotion and while the film can feel a bit safe, it's still deeply touching. There's also a real sense of tranquillity and calm in TWR which you don't normally get during animated films. Maybe Miyazaki's most mature film to date.The film looks amazing in every single frame, and at times it feels more visually stunning than a Pixar movie. Miyazaki puts all of his visual wizardry into every single frame, and he saved the most dazzling stuff for his last film. His direction is typically amazing, and the film feels like true art. To be honest, The Wind Rises feels like an artist painting on a canvas. Like the planes in the centre of its story, it takes off and completely soars. The study of the main character is fascinating, but the love story even more so. Although it was pretty obvious there was going to be a love story this defies expectations by the love story not being cloying and sentimental. TWR often feels like a tribute to the magic of flight, and it's difficult not to be amazed as flight is looked upon with a sense of child-like wonder. A soaring swansong for Miyazaki, and an achingly wonderful story rendered in exquisite artistic fashion.9/10",

Thus there's no room for the magic we loved in previous works. The dream themselves are constricted by the prospect of war from the very beginning. Sadly the main dream come true is the love story, but it is secondary to this boy's dream of building beautiful planes.In the end Miyazaki simply displays his bare soul, apologising that his creative years are behind him and teaching us a depressing lesson about life and dreams and love.",

Considering almost every film that Miyazaki has made has involved some sort of airborne travel, from the Air Ships in Castle in the Sky to the broomstick in Kiki's delivery service, it was long overdue that he made a film solely focused on the art of aviation, and what a film.I don't care if you've never been on a plane or if you design aircraft for a living, it is impossible to watch this film without feeling the sheer love Miyazaki has for this and subsequently, that love rubbing off on you. It's a big divergence from Miyazaki's usual work, everything fantastical is relegated to small dream sequences with this film overall acting as a biography of a real mans life.The man in question is Jiro Horikoski, I had never heard of him before and I doubt many of you have but it just so happens he lived a fascinating life. We see some historical events like the 1923 great Kanto earthquake as well as the Nazis. Is it kind of weird that the Nazis aren't all that bad in this film? Some would say it is but I think there's enough subtle nods to show they are evil but our main character doesn't know. Also, this film isn't really about good guys and bad guys, this is a theme throughout Miyazaki's work where there are hardly any flat out evil characters. Are there characters who appear bad in this, Kurokawa, Jiro's boss at first appears malicious but by the end he is one of your favourite characters.This probably isn't going to be a kids favourite film but for a slightly older audience this is a wonderful film.

            "content": "So, a movie about the engineer who created the scourge of World War Two's pacific arena: Japan's Zero Fighter. One may not expect a fully positive reaction about such a story. The zeros were after all highly feared and brought a swift Japanese domination to East Asia. Yet through the masterful visual storytelling of anime maestro Hayao Miyazaki, this story is adapted into a timeless tale about one man who dared to dream and dared to chase that dream, for better or for worse.Jiro Horikoshi is a boy with ambition. He aims to create the most advanced aircraft in the world; not as weapons of war but as constructs of beauty of splendour compared to the pyramids of Egypt. Spured on by vivid visions of his hero, a classic Italian plane designer named Caproni, Jiro chases his dream. Yet events in life threaten to crush those dreams. First, a disastrous earthquake and fire in which Jiro's selfless nature touches the heart of a girl named Naoko. Then, when he finally lands a job with an aircraft manufacturer, his projects are plagued with failure after failure. A fateful encounter with Naoko years later lands the young couple deeply in love. Jiro, now torn between his ever more time consuming dreams and his steadily weakening wife, has to bear the full consequence of the choices in his life. The Wind Rises is the much advertised swan song of Hayao Miyazaki. And boy does he go out with a good one. Miyazaki peppers this movie with studio Ghibli's little touches of fantasy, particularly in the dream sequences. Easily his most heart wrenching story, the tale of Jiro is emotionally powerful with some genuine tear jerking moments. Although devoid of action, the story moves at a brisk pace through Jiro's life. The fun comes from the various colourful characters Jiro meets along his journey. From his future darling to a quirky German man critical of Hitler's regime, all these characters lend colour to what could have been a dull biopic. To present this lively vision, Studio Ghibli utilises 100% hand drawn and coloured animation. Immediately, the animation has the look of the old classics while still being able to stand toe to toe with modern anime. It is almost lifelike in how smooth the movements of the characters are. Character designs are simple, yet the level of detail shows that the studio spared no expense on the animation. Visual metaphors abound and certain scenes are given some exaggeration as if coloured by Jiro's own emotions and imagination. The result is a beautiful, dynamic, and refreshing visual style that complements the story.The Wind Rises is surprisingly loaded with symbolism and easter eggs for long time anime fans who are willing to dig deeper. In a way, the story of Jiro and the aeroplane mirrors that of Japanese anime and possibly Miyazaki's message to a new generation of anime creators looking to follow in his footsteps. Like the Zero Fighter, anime started off content with copying the style of western cartoons. Through some brave pioneers pushing the boundaries, anime evolved into its own style and like the Zero Fighter, surpassed its western contemporaries. In the dreamscape, Caprioni talks to Jiro of retiring and how Jiro should continue to chase his dreams despite the fear that his designs would be used for war. That's Miyazaki speaking; encouraging new creators to find their own style, forge their own stories, and no matter how companies may twist the medium to its own selfish gain, animation will always be a thing of beauty. Fitting then that Hideaki Anno, controversial creator of infamous anime such as Gunbuster and Neon Genesis Evangelion, be the one to portray the voice of Jiro, a similarly controversial figure in history. A minor flaw with the movie would be the main character. Jiro himself is a little bit of a bore. He is the boy scout who stands up for the bullied, the smart savvy man who leaves his rivals speechless in an argument. All this is not helped by Hideki Anno's flat and emotionally deficient delivery of Jiro's lines. Thats what you get when a director tries to be an actor. The initial romance between Jiro and Naoko may also come across as mind numbingly cheesy, but their eventual life together and trials they face is a big emotional payoff.A bittersweet little yarn with all the makings of an anime classic, The Wind Rises proves that hand drawn 2D animation still has a place in a market saturated by 3D CGI and increasingly flashy computer coloured anime. Watch it for the tragic love story, the colourful characters, the symbolism and deeper themes. As the wind rises, so too does the standard on which good anime is measured.",

The pain felt by the characters at one point becomes very real, you can see the inevitable. But still you learn to hold on and stand your ground till the very end of the film. Do not mistake me. The film does not leave you feeling empty. It leaves you with a sense of elation. Rise form the sorrow, pull through the hardships and live. That's the end message of the film. A simple message, a simple story, but an extraordinary film. Miyazaki steps up his storytelling and once again very skillfully manages to reach out and touch many millions with his 'The Wind Rises'.",

The movie is about a boy's dream on flight and building plane that pushed him to work hard on reaching his goal. Perhaps first an hour is quite monotone but still enjoyable to see. The Wind Rises is definitely different from Hayao Miyazaki's previous movies. It doesn't have a fantasy storyline or cute creature that has been a trademark on all of his movie. It's more like The Grave of Fireflies than Ponyo or The Spirited Away and could be quite complicated and uninteresting for children to see. In spite of that condition, The Wind Rises has it's own uniqueness that hardly to compare with his other film. It's classic and beautifully made, also the love story is surprisingly sweet.

            "content": "I am afraid this movie cannot be considered good. It is slow from the beginning to the end... At minute three I started to question myself... \"Why is this scene lasting 20 seconds ? 21, 22...\". I went to the theater without the knowledge of the synopsis... and I must say, it is the worst way of discovering the film. One must be warned before he watches the movie... that \"the wind rises\" has nothing to do with any other Miyazaki's productions. -- SPOILER -- I have read critiques praising Miyazaki for this \"fantastic, intense, poetic film\"... In my opinion, any beginner could have made a better storyline... and the drama is just so common. It is dull, monotonous, slow. Half of the movie was 100% disappointing and boring, or clich\u00e9 (\"I have loved you from the moment I saw you\" etc). A slight interest caught me in the middle of the movie, when Jiro must struggle for his work and for his wife. Sadly, it is only a fictional part, nothing close to reality... so, well, could have been anything else.Besides, some moral values promoted by the film are disputable... Jiro lets his wife breathe his smoking because she doesn't want to leave him any second... He prefers that she stays living with him rather than having a chance of getting cured in the mountains. And so on. I think this is very childish. Nourishing such ideals is idiotic. There is nothing to be praised in the decisions of this couple. The film only presents a way of thinking at a given period of time, and takes no step back. Miyazaki casts a childish eye upon this couple when he should have been able to emphasize the flaws of this reasoning. Jiro could have made more compromises to take care of his wife... etc. \"But working is important for a man\" says Naoko's father. And... no rebellion, no step back, ... we're deep in some Japanese conceptions of life... and it bothers me deeply. In the same category, Naoko leaving the house not to be seen dead is another weird ideal. Such ideals are WRONG, for very known reasons : any man has a need for mourning when a person dies, and mourning is easier when the dead person can be seen, touched, buried... So basically, Miyazaki here is praising the ability to mourn without seeing the body. Jiro even says \"thank you\" to Naoko who asks him to go on living. I'm so shocked by all these idiotic ideals actually ! Anyway, all in all... their decisions could have made sense. Yes it makes sense when someone is suffering; and you know this person will die eventually; to please her in every way, even if it doesn't benefit her health... It is somehow the \"best\" thing to do when someone is about to die. But the problem is, they stopped fighting far too soon !! How could they know she was so much about to die ?! -- SPOILER -- Many elements of the film needed more depth or explanation or stepping back to make a good adult movie. But as for me, Miyazaki only casts a childish eye on matters way more complex. \"The wind rises\" is the typical example of work that gets fantastic critiques ONLY because of the name of the producer. Say it was \"The wind rises\" made by Unknown 001, it would not have received any good critique. People would have just watched the film for what it is, as I did. But since it's Miyazaki, everyone tries hard to see *what's HIDDEN*, because since it's Miyazaki it must be great !! So let's say the animation is tremendous !! Erm, guys, the animation is absolutely standard. We could expect much more for the last film from Miyazaki...It so seems I don't like any of the \"personal\" films from Miyazaki (\"the wind rises\" and \"Porco Rosso\" as it seems). I do not share the passion for aviation at all and it feels like a neurosis of Miyazaki. To sum up, if you expect the usual Miyazaki fancy, do not watch this movie.",

The film doesn't include any mythical creatures or fantastical worlds; it's all Japan, the sky, the fields, the wind, and those beautiful planes of Jiro's dreams. This is a contemplative story that requires a patient audience. Young kids used to high-octane adventures may not be ready for this introspective tribute to a visionary man, who may have known in the abstract that his designs would one day be used in war, but who really just wanted to, as Caproni told him, make his dreams a reality.The second half of the film features a heartbreaking romance between Jiro and the now grown-up girl he once ushered to safety during the 1923 Earthquake. Naoko (Emily Blunt) is herself an artist who loves landscapes. They long to marry, but Naoko suffers from tuberculosis, a disease even the brilliant Jiro can't troubleshoot. Their scenes together are romantic, but also devastatingly sad -- like when he spends a night finishing blueprints with one hand firmly grasping his ill young wife's hand. The story line isn't exactly a nailbiter, but this is a quietly powerful movie about what it takes to have a singular vision and dedicate your life to it; a tale of a genius, one can only assume, much like Miyazaki himself.",

It takes me longer to warm up to the idea to watching a film than I'd like to admit. It would probably be a lot quicker if I tried to force myself to watch these movies, but then their impact on me would be limited. I have to prepare myself for what lies ahead. But prepare myself I did and here we are.This is Miyazaki's most beautiful movie, and that is saying something.Onto the review.This film has an eighty-nine percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. That is a shame. It deserves a perfect one hundred. I would like to walk up to the eleven percent of so-called professional 'critics' who don't like the movie and perform a wholly terrible act onto them. Some of these people have said this movie is boring. Shame on you. Do you realize that you are promoting more terrible, snappy movies and less masterpieces? I think one of the major problems is that most all of the critics of the movie on that site are Western. Yes, people will always find something to complain about, but, as a Westerner myself, I do say that we are awfully impatient people who want instant satisfaction.This is not that kind of movie. It does not cater to the banality of the masses. One of my favorite films of all time is Leon: The Professional. Comparing it to the rest of Besson's work is an unneeded embarrassment to the latter. The reason I love it so much is that it doesn't seem like it was made by a group of focus groups for our dim masses. It seems like it was made by an artist first for himself. If the world didn't like it, too bad. This film is much the same. It has Miyazaki's heart and soul over its every corner and ridge. He should not have gone out with Mononoke or Spirited Away or a new feature film. This should be his last movie. It is him, through and through.I don't mind if the masses don't like that. It was not made for them. But professional critics, people who are actually getting paid to write reviews, should be better than that. I was better than that when I was fourteen years old and I'm still not getting paid to write these. The basic concept of this movie is that a young boy wants to be a pilot but can't because of his shoddy eyesight so he instead becomes an engineer. He designs some of the best planes in Japan but is forced to come to terms with the fact that they will be used for war. Interspersing this are multiple dream sequences, in which he talks to his idol, the famous Italian designer Caproni. Many have called these sequences boring and repetitive. They... should not be reviewing movies. Nothing is further from the truth. These sequences tie the film together. They are its heart and soul. They kickstart and end it. And they are the thematic core to the film.The film opens with a simple French poem. It goes like this: The wind is rising... we must try to live. Those words struck me like no other. I felt my soul quake. And that's not even mentioning the fact that the name of Ghibli, Miyazaki's studio, comes from a word meaning 'warm wind (thus a rising wind) coming off the Sahara.' The number of ways this should be Miyazaki's last film are too numerous to list here. But rest assured that this is a fitting last film to possibly the greatest director of our times.This poem provides the basis for the theme of the film. Dream Caproni asks Jiro, the protagonist, in many stages of his life, 'Is the wind rising, Japanese boy?\" To which he would respond with some variation of 'Yes, it is.' That is not a phrase fit for a typical three act film. That is a phrase fit for life. I suppose some critics can't handle life. I even saw one say that this film couldn't be penetrated unless you had an understanding of aviation. What a load of mularkey. This film can only be understood by someone who understands life. Generally speaking, the people who don't' like this film have no understanding of the melancholy beauty of life. It treats the audience like capable, functioning adults and not like incessant babies like a lot of films do. Yes, I am angry, depressed, wistful, and joyful right now. This is how life leaves you. And this is how this film leaves you. It is one of those movies that is not only too good to be dissed, it is too good to be praised. I feel dirty even talking about this piece of pure art, Nothing I say here can measure up to the beauty I have seen.Some have said that this is not a perfect film. They are right. It is beyond perfection. It is beyond all of our measly, worthless, petty terms. This is a better film than Frozen. This is a better film than anything released that year. It is, without qualification, the best film of the decade.",

            "content": "'THE WIND RISES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Hayao Miyazaki directed and wrote this Japanese historical fantasy film based on his manga of the same name. Miyazaki's comic is loosely based on the short story 'The Wind Has Risen' (by Tatsuo Hori, a mid-20th century Japanese writer and poet) and tells the fictionalized tale of a Japanese World War II aircraft designer who helped create the Mitsubishi A5M and Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The movie is nominated for 'Best Animated Feature' at the 2014 Academy Awards and has been raved about by critics (it was also the highest grossing film in Japan last year). I found it to be a lot like Miyazaki's other films ('PRINCESS MONONOKE' and 'SPIRITED AWAY' to name a few); bizarrely interesting and extremely creative but also slow paced and uninvolving. The American voice cast includes actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Martin Short, Stanley Tucci, Mandy Patinkin, William H. Macy, Mae Whitman, Jennifer Grey and Werner Herzog. Gordon-Levitt voices Jir\u00f4 Horikoshi, a revolutionary aircraft designer for Japan during World War II. As a child Jir\u00f4 dreamed of being a pilot but decided to become an airplane engineer instead due to his nearsightedness. He gets the idea after having (what he believes is) a shared dream with the famous Italian plane designer named Caproni. The film chronicles his adventures following his dreams as well as a relationship he develops with a young girl, named Nahoko (Blunt), he meets on a train to Tokyo (during the 'Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923').The movie has received a lot of criticism for making a war-plane designer it's hero; also the fact that a lot of those planes were built by Chinese and Korean workers who were forced into it (it's also been criticized for the heavy smoking the heroes do in it). These are all subjects that are pretty mature for a children's animated movie but it is rated PG-13 in America and the fact that it's geared towards adults is what makes it so appealing to a lot of people. Like Miyazaki's other films though it's also intended for kids, which is one of the things I don't like about these movies; it transitions between children's fantasy cartoon and mature adult subject matter too easily. It seems like it wants to be taken as a serious character drama but then it's also filled with cheesy cartoon dialogue (and the characters aren't believable as real world people). That's what makes these films so intriguing and popular with Miyazaki's fans though. I have mixed feelings about it (like with all of his other movies).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4",

The story is inspirational and emotional.I kind of feel that this is a story that would have benifited from being live action instead, with some amazing actors and set pieces. Of course, that would be an whole other undertaking. And Hayao Miyazaki sticks to what he knows and does best, animation. And it works, it's a very unique and beautiful movie in that sense also, don't get me wrong. It's just that compared to other Hayao Miyazaki films, this is a very slow movie, totally based in reality, with almost only scenes with talking and smaller events, besides some dream sequences, it doesn't have any big animations spectacles, like other Hayao Miyazaki. It's also soft and slow phased movie, so might perhaps become slightly boring, especially since the animated characters doesn't have that many facial expressions. Also, film is based on a real person that existed in Japan during the early 1900s to later. But the script makes up its on version of this person's life, that is more an self made interpretation based on self interest. It's not bad, just that I think that should be known.Good movie.

The camera pans across the stretch of a plane, diving into the distance and blowing glades of grass, with a fluffy clouded sky in the background. This is all easily confused with an acrylic painting.The Wind Rises (Kaze Tachinu) is Hayao Miyazaki's final film, and the only one he's solely directed and written since Ponyo (along with films like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke). It was released in Japan on July 20, 2013, and is to hit North American theatres February 21, 2014, although if you were lucky, you got to catch it at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival. Based on a manga of the same name, The Wind Rises tells the story of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter aircraft during WWII. However, the personal events in the film are completely fictional.Jiro's desire to make something beautiful was an inspiration to Miyazaki. Jiro's dedication to creating a revolutionary plane (for the war, or not) makes up most of the film. But the surprising love story about an unrelenting affection through sickness and health that takes over the second half of the movie is what tears at your insides and gets into that special spot inside of you, reserved only for the most touching stories.If you try to compare it to other Studio Ghibli films, The Wind Rises seems to be in its own category \u2014 neither like the fun and fantastical My Neighbour Totoro nor the futuristic Castle in the Sky. It's a more \"serious\" film, with tales of perseverance, the Second World War, and a heart-wrenching romance. That isn't to say Miyazaki doesn't imbue fantastical elements that allow the story to come alive in the limitless animated form, but this feature film is the realest story of Ghibli's I've come across, which helps to draw the viewer into this emotional tale.Jiro was an extremely lovable and understandable character. His age puts him apart from younger Ghibli heroes, which made the film feel more relatable than his others, despite the dreamy and surreal scenes Miyazaki included. More than ever, it's clear Miyazaki is at the peak of animation genius in this personal project, and with a film as stunning as this one, it seems a good place to retire.Overall, the end of the first half has its slow parts, but the film soon picks up with full drama in its second half. The animation is breathtaking, with characters delicately placed into scenes where each key frame could have been an artwork on its own. If you're not convinced, take a look at his water colour storyboards. Miyazaki's work in the world of animation will surely be missed.",

Then I was thoroughly prepared to enjoy every piece of it and indeed I did. What a great piece of work as being in his 70s, definitely a farewell masterpiece. A most matured movie, I mean for the first time a movie for grownups that had contents children won't fit in to enjoy from the studio as well from the director.It was just like the movie 'The Aviator'. A boy, Jiro Horikoshi, who aspires to contribute his skills to upgrade the aircraft technology who was actually inspired by the Italian aircraft designer Caproni. At his young age, he excels in the field that leads him to grab an opportunity to work with the nation's most renowned aircraft manufacturer. His life mixed with dreams and reality makes him a better man among his coworker. Everyone believed that he's a workaholic, but he surprises all by falling in love. The movie explained his ambition, passion towards aircrafts and his romantic life as well as the dreams that make him to believe everything is feasible.''Airplanes are beautiful cursed dreams... waiting for the sky to swallow them up''There are very few so far in the history of filmmaking that animation borrowed story from biographies. This was way better than what live shot movie would have offered to the viewers. Especially this story had few dream scenes, like a fantasy that we had seen in 'The Lovely Bones'. Those were really well done, a trademark that usually we find in all of Hayao Miyazaki movies. If you are a fan of his work, then it will be a delightful 2 hour long treat for sure. I had the experience of watching this like watching the final match of the FIFA world cup. I could never ask better than this.Kind of inspiring theme about engineering work and a message teller about non-violence. That this movie was set during the world war, including Japan's involvement in the affair. So there were many dialogues that delivers against the idea of war, like, the famous Caproni regrets that his invention was misused in the wars. The movie had lots of smoking scenes, as it sets in and around the 20s that was fine because people did in those times. After all, like I said earlier, it is for adult, even if parents allow their kids to watch they may fall in boredom. So I see there's no controversy to drag on.''Engineers turn dream into reality''There were few sentiments, it appeals strongly during the end portion. The end also leaves lots of questions about what could have happened afterwards, especially Jiro's Romance life. Someway it gives the impression of happy ending and in another way slightly hurts. A finely balanced grand finale. Those were the seconds (the time) I was not desired for because no more Miyazaki's movie to see afterwards. I believed the end of a great era of him and studio Ghibli together. Overall, gives the satisfaction of watching a man's true story, his romantic life, involvement in achieving the dream and got a place in his country's history. Now the director showed it to the rest of the world in a beautiful manner. Thank you Hayao Miyazaki for all your contributions, I always keep loving your great works. Enjoy your rest of the life.",

Whilst it is unfortunate, The Wind Rises, his latest work, will be his last film.\"The Wind Rises\" is completely different from his other films. It's based on a true story that took place in a tumultuous era encompassing he Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, and the tuberculosis epidemic in Japan. It was a period of extreme poverty in Japan, and people struggled just to survive. The main character, Jiro, dreams of flying and designing beautiful airplanes, inspired by the famous Italian aeronautical designer, Caproni. He joins a major Japanese engineering company and becomes one of the most prominent and innovative aeronautical designers. During this time Jiro meets and falls in love with Nahoko. While Jiro works very hard to create sophisticated airplane designs as an engineer, he spends some fleeting moments with Nahoko who suffers from tuberculosis.Before I watched the movie, I wondered if people from outside of Japan would feel the same way that Japanese audiences do, whether they would sympathize with, or be offended by the story, because it focuses on the Japanese history and culture during the war. The story is about humans and engineers who seek ideal designs, rather than about patriotism or ideology. Therefore, people from all countries, young and old alike, will enjoy and be touched by how Jiro and Nahoko fall ever more deeply in love even though their time is limited. While Jiro works to design his ideal planes. I think he must have known that his planes were going to be used as killing machines, but as an engineer, he still wanted to create what he was able to imagine.I watched this film in Austin, Texas. When the credits rolled, some people in the audience applauded the film, expressing the realization that this was truly Miyazaki's last.Even though the story is great and there is much depth to the character, unfortunately, I felt it wasn't the best movie of Miyazaki. Still, it was worth seeing how he dealt with the challenge of this historical material. The message is strong and straightforward. He wanted to tell audiences to dream and look to the future.",

            "content": "The Wind Rises, the latest and possibly the last film by the great Hayao Miyazaki, is at the same time utterly typical for its director and something new altogether. Taking place in the real world and containing no fantasy elements whatsoever - a few dream sequences notwithstanding - it feels like a passion project for Miyazaki, something he has been wanting to do for a long time. And you can see a lot of his favourite things in it. Flying, airplanes, early 20th century Italy (though the film takes place in Japan), the effect of industrial revolution on traditions, strong and determined laymen and -women, all that good stuff.The story is at the same time more down to earth as well as grander in scale, passing through years and years while dealing with the issues of war, hardship and what it means to be passionate about something if that passion can be turned against other people. In an essence a film with a lot of depth. Miyazaki's directing and storytelling handle and examine these themes with care and precision. It's forceful and straight to the point when it needs to be, but it's never in your face nor does it ever spout exposition. Yet you're never left wondering what the movie is trying to say. Its message is clear as night and day, yet you get it through your own realization and reading between the lines.The movie is also utterly gorgeous. Beautifully hand-animated by Japan's best, it's full of little details and moments that you could very easily miss if not for the sheer skill which they have been drawn. One of my favourite moments in the film was when a woman walks on a polished wooden floor and you can see her smoky reflection on the floor. Unbelievable animation and for a moment I could have sworn the floor was real and not merely animated.The Wind Rises might not be one of Miyazaki's best films - in my opinion that honour goes either to Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away - but it's still one of the best films I've seen in a while, animated or otherwise. Its story comes straight from its director's heart and its a fitting farewell to one of the best animation directors of all time.",

            "content": "\"The wind is rising! We must try to live!\" Paul ValeryThe Wind Rises has two stories: the story of Jiro Horikoshi (voice of Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who designed the Japanese Zero, arguably the most effective fighter plane in WWII, or at least the most feared; and the story of love for his tubercular young wife, Nahoko (Emily Blunt). The animated planes soar like beautiful birds, and his love soars in a similarly graceful, albeit short, arc like a sweeping wing.The genial director, Hayao Miyazaki, who has so imaginatively shown us flying pigs and castles and other unworldly things, comes down to earth with a gentle bio and a love story so unlike Frozen it's no wonder Wind did not beat it in the Oscar race. The slow pace of the film, so different from our quick cutting, cookie cutting stories, gives everyone a chance to think about the deep issues in the film, but it could make American audiences squirm with impatience.The real world of Japanese war mongers who used Jiro's design to foment war contrasts with the idealism of a gifted aeronautical engineer who loved only flight, not fight.Miyazaki's recent death, making this arguably his last work, highlights his brilliance: Cat buses can give way to airplanes, from a director whose dad owned an airplane factory. Miyazaki left a legacy of intelligence and romance for animation. Perhaps the wind rises is also the story of the director himself, whose spirit rose like a prevailing wind. The genius Italian flight designer Caproni (Stanley Tucci) best expresses the film's amalgam of romance and realism: \"Airplanes are just cursed dreams, waiting for the sky to swallow them up.\"",

The Wind Rises is a biopic based on the life of Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese engineer in World War II. It follows him throughout his life, showing him first as a brilliant young boy obsessed with the beauty of planes, then as a young man set on designing and creating them. The film is complex and multi-layered in its description of Jiro's character. He seems to be a tortured artist at times, dealing with the ever-present threat of failure, but at other times he is a reluctant engineer, a tool of the Japanese government used to create weapons of war. Legendary director Hayao Miyazaki maneuvers around his complex character with a perfect smoothness that allows the whole story to fit together and to make sense. As the film progresses, we understand Jiro as a person, as a true human being.Beauty in film is a rare thing. Visual beauty, of course, is not. We are constantly exposed to fantastic landscapes, each holding its own special, intricate beauty, leaving us marveling at the seemingly boundless extent of the human imagination. But all-around beauty, beauty in theme, character, dialogue, story, plot, emotion as well as visual beauty is very sparingly achieved in film. We are constantly exposed to visual masterpieces that sacrifice plot and even coherence for awe-inspiring visuals. But The Wind Rises is a special film. It achieves this beauty, almost perfectly. The animation is as beautiful as the plot itself. The film relentlessly tugs at your heart, whether by its beautifully animated landscapes or its wonderful, striking, and heartrending plot.Goodbye, Mr. Miyazaki. We will miss you.",

            "content": "Hayao Miyazaki has already gone down as one of the great, if not greatest, animated filmmakers of all time. With The Wind Rises, he chooses to end his glorious career which featured the likes of Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Unlike Clint Eastwood, Miyazaki is apparently sticking to his retirement statement and making way for new animators, instead of staying around far past his welcome (although I think it is agreed that that wouldn't ever be the case.) The Wind Rises is a feast for the eyes. I have not seen this beautiful of animation for quite some time. Yet, curiously for his final film, it is his most naturalistic. There aren't any floating castles, monsters, or lovable creatures, but instead we get a grounded group of animated humans who feel completely real. Considering it is a fictionalized biography, which is also curious since it isn't really normal to have animated biopics, we cannot exactly stray into the unnatural, except for the dream sequences. The film follows the life of Jir\u00f4 Horikoshi, who wants nothing more in life than to build beautiful aircrafts. We see him from a young age fascinated by anything that flies. His dreams are filled with the impending doom that aircraft would bring, as well as visions of the future of flight. The story begins in 1918, which isn't really clear in the movie, and by the end we are in 1932. One of the few qualms I had with this film is we are left to do the math ourselves as to the ages of our characters, because after the brief prologue in 1918, the characters look basically the same age, while we receive hints as to how much time is passed. It is a tale filled with love, change, war, and disaster, a truly \"epic\" animated film in my books. The English voice-cast includes the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Mandy Patinkin, and Stanley Tucci, each providing a totally unique voice for the lovable array of characters. Martin Short does the voice of the short-stature superior of Jir\u00f4, who looks basically like a male version of Edna Mode from The Incredibles. I will say that film struggles in its script. Some of the nuances are lost in translation and prove to be more cheesy in English than they probably would in Japanese which leads to some awkward dialog situations. The other problem is that the script feels like it is too coincidental and accepting. Some of the instances feel rash and occasionally a character's actions and behaviors feel rather foolish and ignorant about what is actually going on, but then again it is an animated film and it doesn't really take too much away from the film as a whole.Yet, in the end the film raises questions, just like the questions raised in Jir\u00f4 as he realizes the things he is building are being used for war. Does creating our dream, even if it is causing pain through someone else, really constitute as a success after all? This is the guilt that Jir\u00f4 eventually has to wrestle with as he begins to see that money, greed, power and war all can use things of beauty to create the exact opposite. It is painful watching something as elegant as an airplane be used for such destructive purposes, but even Miyazaki can still make it pleasureful for the eyes to watch. The Wind Rises is truly Miyazaki's swan song. His fans can rest easy knowing he ended on his consistent high note. Yet, it is sad that the world will no longer be graced by his indelible charm and ability to suck you into his worlds and letting you experience and feel things when you least expect to. You never want to leave the world's he creates, they are so engrossing and inviting that you cannot help but feel like they should go on forever. Maybe that is why we do not receive any information at the end of the film regarding the fates of our characters, so the spirit of the Jir\u00f4, like the films of Miyazaki, could live on forever without really coming to an end. He made the choice of making this his last film, and he, like Jir\u00f4, succeeded in creating his dreams, every single one of those magical thoughts that will not soon be forgotten by those who have fallen in love with his library of great works. So, if you want to see the last film of one of the most prolific and consistently masterful filmmakers, go check this one out, you won't regret it. For more reviews, check out Ragingfilm.com",

            "content": "Miyzaki's films are famous the world over for their use of quirky fantasy elements, breathtaking animation tactics and environmental themes. It's all well and good to spread a strong message against consumerism and pollution and all that with cutesy little animals and children, but I personally find that his most effective pictures are the ones grounded in reality.Of course, for the main character of The Wind Rises, he prefers not to be grounded in reality, and he has some pretty trippy dreams sometimes about building a spectacular aircraft, but in the meantime he's studying to be an aeronautical engineer. Jiro has imagined all his life that he'll work with planes, and his friend Caproni, an Italian engineer who visits him in his dreams, guides him to designing planes instead of flying them because of his poor vision. Jiro gets employed by Mitsubishi, and throughout the film he meets many incredible friends, from his dwarfish boss with a bad temper, to a Soviet spy who fled Germany because he disapproves of Hitler's cruel tactics and the actions of the Nazis. He also meets Nahoko, a young girl with tuberculosis who later becomes his devoted wife. Unfortunately the war soon collides with Jiro's dreams, resulting in his designs being used for horror rather than peace.I've heard many complaints about this film, specifically that it doesn't address Jiro in a more negative light for designing the planes in the first place. Because Studio Ghibli creates films targeted mostly towards children at this point though, I'd hardly think it appropriate for the production company to be showing fully the diabolical madness of WWII or Japan's treatment of China at the time. Did Jiro ever want his plane designs used for evil? I highly doubt that was the man's intention, although he was very naive. Weren't most people? WWII was hell on earth back then, and nobody wanted to think the worst of each other. Miyzaki tackles a touchy subject very effectively, sharing with viewers that yes, this did happen, but instead of creating a graphic and gory war film and focusing purely on Kamikaze suicide missions, he shares the life of an engineer with a dream, using nostalgic piano melodies and Italian-esque accordion tunes to set the scene, as well as colourful animation techniques that don't rely too heavily on fancy effects to be good. Like his earlier \"Grave of the Fireflies\", this film is real and incredible, without trying to inject any preachy messages about humanity destroying the earth. It's about real people, and after a while the characters all start to feel almost like old friends.",

            "content": "Anime master Hayao Miyazaki purportedly last film is a biopic on Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of several planes used by Japan during World War II. I quite like this unusual film, even though there is seemingly not much in the plot: our protagonist daydreams as a child of being a airplane designer, survives the 1923 Tokyo earthquake, enters as a young engineer the Mitsubishi airplane firm, goes to Germany to study the Junkers planes, returns to Japan and builds better and better planes that will be eventually used in World War II. (Miyazaki clearly loves WW2 era airplanes: they were already the subject of his previous \"Porco Rosso\", which I found a weak effort when I saw it some years ago).Being a Miyazaki film, it would be redundant to dwell too much on the incredible artistry involved. While watching this, it dawn on me that even though engineering is very important and in facts permeates the modern world, there are very few movies (or novels or stage plays, for that matter) with an engineer as a protagonist. Part of this, I believe, is a culture clash between artists and engineers. I think engineers by temperament and personality tend to be responsible and well grounded, quite the opposite traits of bohemian artists, who tend to find them boring as well as social and political conformists. Unlike scientists, they are not even seen as eccentrics. In the artists' eyes, engineers are not good material either for heroes or villains.Back to the film, perhaps the only important flaw in the movie is that it becomes so defensive at the end on the fact that his planes were used in a war. Well, of course, they were, as did the planes of other countries in the conflict.Summing up, this is not probably the very best film of Miyazaki, but it is very well worth watching.",

(see similar films which are well-done visually but poor in story qualities-- Avatar and Titanic). The story is one Hollywood has made over and over again-- poor boy rises from the ranks (Alger plot line) to overcome hidebound superiors and opponents (Rocky) while struggling with a dying girlfriend (Camille, any Joan Crawford weepy). Not only is that story tired, but it relies much too heavily on easy emotion-- just show a young person dying and we're all supposed to break down crying. Bleh.

Yes the Japanese went through a tough time in WWII but then so did the people and countries they went to war with. I believe this film would be more acceptable had it not been a biopic so it doesn't have that baggage of reality.In an interview with Japanese actor Ken Watanabe on another war movie \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" points out \"...Unfortunately, most Japanese people aren't aware of this tragedy; even I didn't know until I did the film. It's difficult to say why, but perhaps it has something to do with the lack of a good education. This film deals with only one of many tragedies in the history of the world, but hopefully it will get people to think more about these forgotten incidents.\" In watching this film, you need to take into account the context that Miyazake is trying to operate in. He wanted to remind people of the past but he clearly takes pride in his culture and history but has to side step the accountability of this main character to a certain degree. This is very hard to do. But whether this is intentional the main character's tragic loss in the end seems to suggest that karma like accountability.",

            "content": "When we want to give a tribute, we usually want it to be something memorable. In the case of Miyazaki, this tribute is telling a creative story that transcends reality. This happens to be a story about Japan's visionary engineer of aviation. His dream was to ride the wind. Although he couldn't be a pilot, his poor eyesight did not hinder him from pursuing this dream. This led him to design airplanes instead, with the aim of bringing any ordinary person to experience traveling in the sky. But in his time, planes were not made to pursue this dream but rather they were made to bring destruction. We might expect that this tribute would be in a form of an accurate account of Jiro Hirokoshi's life, but since this was helmed by a visionary artist, the result was rather an imaginative depiction of the protagonist's life.Just like Miyazaki's previous work, the storytelling is engrossing, and we are in for a visual treat. The difference, however, is that we no longer have the essence of a fairy tale on the same level as that of Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. The film was more serious, and it actually ended with a tragic tone, although it is far from the depressing mood of Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies. This is Miyazaki in his more introspective side about dealing with social issues such as war. You may also observe that more weight is given to the dialogue for the story's progression, and we even have a dose of politics involving Germany and Japan together with the technicalities about aircraft design. Unlike, Howl's Moving Castle, the film is evenly paced, but when compared to My Neighbor Totoro, the visuals are given less opportunity to breath. Although the film is rather inaccurate as a biopic, the story about Hirokoshi's love interest made the film more compelling. The accuracy is beside the point though because what we are really witnessing is Miyazaki's vision, his very own tribute to Hirokoshi (and as the end credits say, it is also a tribute to Tatsuo Hori).For those who have enjoyed Miyazaki's film for its fantastic side, you might miss it here. He tackles a more mature theme this time, and arguably this is his most complex film in terms of writing. Although I think it is not as good as Spirited Away, it still deserves to be considered as one of his most notable works.",

            "content": "Once again Miyazaki, and company, set a precedent which likely won't be matched even by the touching works of Pixar. You go on a journey in which a boy sees his dreams become reality in a time when Japan is in the midst of war, a depression, and oppression from the Germans. But, even with so many morose topics, there is laughter, love, and career accomplishments making for a, seemingly, biographical tale which makes animation seemingly a good medium for future biographical endeavors.Characters & StoryFirst, it should be noted that the film is a work of \"Historical Fiction,\" in a Forrest Gump type of way, but with a smaller time period covered. We begin with Jiro (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as a boy who dreams of creating airplanes, fast forward to him in college when the Great Kanto Earthquake happens, and then again during the time when Japan was an active participant in World War II. Over the course of each portion of his life, he speaks with famous Italian designer Giovanni Caproni (Stanley Tucci), in his dreams, about their mutual love for aircrafts, which unfortunately will not be utilized for travel and the beauty of flying through the air, but instead war.But, while the story does feature the war, Nazis, and other dark subjects, it also has that Forrest Gump element of having a likable lead, and him being surrounded by characters who are all comical in their own way. Be it his boss Kurokawa (Martin Short), whose look alone could draw laughter; his best friend Honjo (John Krasinski) who gets laughs due to his cigarette addiction; or even Jiro's little sister Kayo (Mae Whitman) who is constantly on her brother's case for not being as attentive, or around, as she likes. Also, there is a love interest, Naoko (Emily Blunt), and with her inclusion, it makes the film, and Jiro's story, seem more than \"Historical Fiction\" to the point if someone didn't tell you this was simply based off Jiro Horikoshi's life, you'd believe this was a true ode to the man.PraiseAs noted in the story summary, this film covers a lifetime and through the various characters, and stories within, keeps you interested during the 2 hour film. I would dare even say that after watching a movie like this, I can't see why biopics of the future couldn't be done if not in Studio Ghibli's style, than the more technological dependent methods. And speaking of style, Miyazaki's love for traditional animation is seen in such splendor in this film. From little things like the way water or flowers move, to the giant sized tear drops, everything has Miyazaki's signature style on it, and the story is no different.Like with the film's ability to make you cry, get excited, and really twists your emotions almost as if done on whim. For, between the lovable Jiro, his love interest Naoko, and his various friends and family members, I don't think you can even say that live action characters all get as well developed to the point you genuinely miss them when they are gone, and get excited when they return to the screen.And the last thing I really liked was it felt like a love letter to not just Jiro, but Japan as well. Most of Miyazaki's films are placed in some sort of fantasy world so while they do borrow from Japanese culture, they aren't immersed in it. This film however presents Japan, its culture, and history through Jiro in a way which may not break things down to the point you can understand the whys and hows, but you get a good enough idea to be intrigued enough to do your own research.CriticismFor me, there are only minor issues with the film. The first being that the time length is felt and, outside of that, I would note that some of the sounds used in the film, especially the early parts, sound a bit strange. I'm not sure if they were made from human bodies or archive records, but either way the sounds used are strange enough to take you out of being immersed, if just temporarily.Overall: Worth SeeingDue to the length, I would probably wait until it comes out on VOD/ DVD, but even with that said I think this is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of animation. For, like Scorsese's Hugo, this is very much a love letter to a pioneer and the love letter also extends, in my opinion, to the country Miyazaki calls home. And with memorable characters, good laughs, a nice romantic plot, and a story which really makes you feel something, I can't recommend this enough. Also, I believe this should win the Academy Award.",

            "content": "The brand is so strong with Ghibli, and the name of Miyazaki generally means great work \u2013 even to something without any real knowledge or interest in Japanese animation per se; so there is an expectation that each film will soar. With The Wind Rises, the critics all seemed to suggest it was an instant classic, but mostly I tried to avoid reviews and hype, and did not watch in a rush. The plot follows the key moments in the life of Jiro Horikoshi, who designed Japanese fighter planes during World War II. We join him as a student and follow his career through romance and flights of fancy which inspire his work.Visually it is as pretty as ever, with the real life providing plenty of detail, and the dream sequences having lots of energy and creativity. However, these aspects contrast quite badly with the majority of the content, which is interesting \u2013 but no more than this. The narrative plays out in a very functional way. The purpose of the dream sequences seem to be almost an attempt to liven up the story, and the romance elements seem exaggerated to introduce a heart that isn't in the majority of the telling. There are efforts at color and humor, and most of it does add to the film in a way that makes it more lively than it may otherwise have been. Problem is that the core of the film isn't this way, either in the detail or the character.Jiro is mostly a dull character, particularly after the youthful spirit of the first third settles down. I did not connect with him, his work, or his sacrifice \u2013 and the final scenes did nothing for me as a result. The content of the film also seems off, because it is not just one of invention and passion, but rather the spirit of the war effort is behind. There are some mentions to this, but that inherent darkness only seems to be dealt with in mentions rather than what it really deserved. I guess this is a balancing act and an awkward aspect \u2013 I'm not sure how best it could have been handled beyond the muted presence, but it struck me as oddly present but not present throughout.Worth a look for the basic story and the animation, but mostly it is a functional piece which surprised me by lacking heart and not drawing me in emotionally.",

With the long time-line of the film, I was sometimes confused as to who was who; I'm not sure if it was the same woman all along. She was totally uninteresting and resultantly, I had no real concern for her whenever she was in trouble, but perhaps some concern for Jiro by extension.The detail and accuracy of the animations certainly adds to the engagement of the film and the recurring dreams of Caproni certainly help in conveying Jiro's enthusiasm for engineering. I would only recommend this film to people with an existing interest in engineering or science.",

            "content": "I must admit, I had high expectations before watching this movie. I heard tons of positive reviews, and as a Miyazaki movie, I expected it to be poetic, deeply touching and rather sad. It seems numerous people felt that way when they saw it: it didn't work on me the tiniest bit.What I liked: -the depiction of Japan in a modernization and westernization phase, something we rarely see on TV. Traditional kimonos side with western costumes, modern cars move along ancient ox carriages. The way this modernization impacts on the people could have been deepened though, even if it's not central to the movie-the depiction of the work of engineers, the many little details that they have to take into account and that inspire them: the weight of screws, the form of a fish bone. This is also something rarely seen on TV that I for myself find quite fascinating.-the beautiful landscapes and colors you expect of a Miyazaki moving. Since it shows the real world you may not be \"spirited away\", but still I found it very pretty.What I didn't not enjoy: pretty much everything else. - First of all: \"The wind rises\" is veeeeery repetitive. I couldn't count the amount of train rides, plane crashes, dream flights with Caproni, unsubtle hints on the movie's maxim (Paul Val\u00e9ry citation \"Le vent se l\u00e8ve\", wind blows in the face of the hero), and repetitions of this quite pretty melody that becomes extremely annoying the tenth time it is repeated (seriously, almost all of the film had one and the SAME melody).The story arc: in my opinion there was none. No suspense, no tension, the movie is just a 2 hours-long sequence of unrelated scenes glued to each other in a chronological manner. No character or relationship development either, and even some plot holes. I like slow paced movies where few happens (Sofia Coppola is one of my favorite director), but they have to be hypnotic, they shouldn't give you this feeling of waiting (which gives you the opportunity to ponder upon the reason why you keep watching). I waited during the whole movie to feel implicated, but nope, I was just bored beyond belief. -This is mainly due to the characters and their relationships to each other, that feel extremely superficial and clich\u00e9d. Jiro is the good, studious and naive boy (with a few \"knight in a white armor\"-scenes), Naoko is shy, fragile and soooo in love, Kayo the little sister is a grumpy-faced Chihiro, the few Germans are cold and harsh control-freaks. That over the 20 years of the story none of the faces evolve doesn't help. The romance between perfect workaholic Jiro and his devoted (submissive?) wife that hasn't any background story and any wish of her own (except to die without disturbing her husband?!!) is also really disturbing and syrupy sweet, but let's skip this part. -the main reason why I didn't like is the light and very oblique way it spoke about Japanese history, WW2 and the role of our nice hero Jiro. Jiro and his team conceived the Mitsubishi Zero, one of the deadliest plane of WW2, that was assembled by Korean and Chinese slaves? Let's not lose ONE SINGLE WORD about it. After all, poor Jiro didn't see one of his beloved planes come back from war. After all, Jiro has one or two naive pacifist punchlines: \"I just wanted to build beautiful planes\" \"the weight of the plane will fit if we leave out the machine guns\". Should be enough to excuse what he'd done for fascism in Japan. Which isn't acknowledged, either. The only suffering you see or hear of is that of the poor Japanese people (Tokyo earthquake, ruins after Americans bombed the country...), not the one Japan brought upon the whole Pacific. It could have been a nice tale about the impact of naive geniuses on the world, but it's not. Just feels like avoidance. To me, Miyazaki gets none of it: the seriousness, the madness and the cruelty of that era of history. This film is ill-conceived and unreflected, and I'm still amazed by its critical acclaim. Definitely not a movie I'll recommend, except in a reflection upon whitewashing and Japan's blinkered examination of its own history.",

Neither I nor you: But when the leaves hang trembling, The wind is passing through.\" The film consists of three major plot points: his dreams, his love for planes, and his love for love.His Dreams:The film begins in a way that is seen in many of Ghibli's film, a film of youth and wonder. It starts with a younger boy and his dreams, and then dwells into later portions of his life, mostly about a ten thirteen year period.Throughout the film, there are fictional sequences as well. Some of the more Miyazaki scenes are in these dreams. Mr. Caproni, Jiro's hero, based on Giovanni Battista Caproni, shows his love for flight as well. He reveals to be in his own dream as well and they share their love of flight. These happen to be some of my favorite scenes of the film, partially since it is the most Miyazaki like.His Love for Planes:While going through the major period of Jiro Horikoshi's young adult life, that is from University to post, it dwells on his idea of what aircraft should be. He wants to solely design planes as a sign of joy but knows that they will be used for war. He eventually designs the Zero plane, a plane that became known in the war as a fierce dog fighter.His love for love:There does happen to be a secondary plot point, his love life. In actuality, his wife never had tuberculosis. Knowing of this before the film, I felt a little bit of unwanted sentimentality. It wasn't exactly as necessary and it took away from the film's objectives.Summary:The Wind Rises is a rather interesting tale, and one that is unlike many of Miyazaki's films. The closest film in terms of themes is another film by Ghibli, Grave of the Fireflies, a movie as critically acclaimed as it is sad. It is highly recommended though.On another note, Hisashi's soundtrack is excellent. Highly recommended. Visuals are astounding. I also like the creative use of human voices for planes/earthquakes. It almost quite literally breaths life into these machines.8.5/10",

Some of these fantasy films include Spirited Away, Ponyo, My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, and The Cat Returns. His last film, The Wind Rises, was recently released, and is like none of his previous animations. In the other movies, the characters are set in a bizarre, surreal, magnificent world on an unusual mission. In The Wind Rises, however, there is no unseen, amazing world. Rather, the story is set in Japan, and it revolves around an airplane designer, Jiro Horikoshi. What Miyazaki does to bring the story to life is focus and discover the beauty in times most people don't see beauty. For example, work can be drudgery and an annoying aspect of life. However, Miyazaki sees work as a time of inspiration and an opportunity to display one's skills. The rain can be gross and make one feel dank, but Miyazaki sees it as a beautiful experience and an opportunity to hold close to a loved one under a small umbrella. By focusing on the different views, Miyasaki had made The Wind Rises just as enchanting as his surreal animations. The Wind Rises is extremely captivating in animation and thought. The story was based on true events, so it was realistic, yet it shows that life can be fantastic when looked at in the right perspective. In this picture, Jiro Horikoshi has vivid dreams of designing airplanes throughout his life. Along his journey, he faces a devastating Japanese earthquake and later meets his soul mate, who was dying. In the end, Jiro builds the \"Zero\" jet, later reminiscing about the creation and speaking sadly by the thousands of deaths caused by the \"Zero\" planes in the military. This film elicits giggles, smiles, and tears, getting to the hearts of the people.",

With the trend towards CGI and Hayao Miyazaki's intended retirement, there is not likely to be another example as fine as \"The Wind Rises\". I feel privileged to have seen it.As expected for a Studio Ghibli film, the quality of the animation was of the highest order. The detail and beauty of the backgrounds and landscapes was magnificent. There was no shortcuts taken on crowd scenes and panoramic. Even as a veteran animation viewer there were moments in this film that just left me in awe. The clouds over Tokyo after the earthquake, the dance of light and shadows in the streets of Berlin and the wind catching the shade umbrella were just some scenes that cause an immediate visceral response in me. The story, I know, is problematic for some people. It is about aircraft designer Jiro Horikoshi and his struggles leading up to the creation of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter plane, known to the allies as the Claude (not the Zero as some have suggested). Interwoven into the film is a love story between Jiro and Naoko, a girl he meets and helps during the earthquake. Japan was largely a pre-industrial society at this time, desperately trying to modernise in order to catch up to western nations that looked down on it as an inferior upstart. I thought this was shown beautifully in this film. One aspect I particularly liked was the way he contrasted the trains of Japan with those of Europe. Western nations paid lip service to helping Japan modernise its aircraft and Jiro soon realised that they would have to make the leap forward themselves and not rely on others for help. This is at the core of the film.The Claude was the first all-metal monoplane fighter designed for carriers and meant that Japan made the leap from being behind everyone else in this field of technology to world leaders. To have advanced so far in such a short time took the world by surprise and this gave Japan confidence that it was not inferior to western nations. That was to me was the key theme, that with imagination, perseverance and dedication, great things can be achieved.There has been some criticism about how much war guilt should be expressed in this film. The obvious connection to being on the \"wrong side\" of World War II clouds some peoples vision of the points raised in the film. I believe these criticisms are ill-informed. Japan's road to war was due to a mix of militarism and lack of viable civilian government and not to the invention of a particular plane. It would have happened regardless with the same outcome. I feel that this may well be Hayao Miyazaki's last film because there is so much reflection in it on themes that have been so close to him over his career. His love of the inter-war period of planes, trains, ships and cars etc where there was an enormous variation in design. The struggle in the modernisation of Japan while striking a balance with their cultural and traditional beliefs and way of life. Even the appearance of tuberculosis reminded me of his earlier work.I fully embraced this film and cannot wait to watch it again.",

            "content": "Let's begin with the positive. This movie is undeniably well crafted. There's more animation in a woman folding her shirt than there is in an entire episode of Naruto. The music was nice, but scarce and often held quite a similar theme throughout the film. The story was good, mainly a character driven plot, with some enjoyable dream scenes. I liked how throughout the film it shifted between dream/imagination and reality. Sometimes I questioned whether this story was set in the real world or some alternate universe, with subtle differences. Now a few negative comments and why I had to drop three stars... I personally felt it was a little bit too slow. This doesn't mean to say I wanted something fast paced, because it almost felt like the pacing of the film reflected the beautiful calm of souring through the sky in a plane. But some scenes really did feel far too slow, and I felt there was far too much animation, I hate to say it, wasted on fleshing out scenes when it could have been put to much better use adding to facial animation (which I'll get to in a tick) or even making another movie! The emotional content felt like it was poorly executed in places and could have had a much more jarring effect. A good way to put it is anticlimactic, not in content just execution. Their faces also didn't really show much emotion; usually if someone was sad, they'd keep the same expression and tears would form. Perhaps this lack of facial expression throughout the film could just be the culture of the Japanese and not an issue with bad acting, yes animators are actors.Also, it was quite void of music which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it might have made it that much better with an amazing score.All in all, I left the film fairly satisfied, it was a pleasure to watch but I won't be going out of my way to recommend this film, unless I was speaking to someone with a love for animation. After the hype has died down I think it'll average out to around 7.4-7.7/10",

            "content": "From the mastermind behind anime classics like My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke & Spirited Away, The Wind Rises is possibly the final feature film in the glorious film career of the greatest animator of all time whose contribution to this medium has been so profound, influential & immense that the world of cinema, art & culture will forever be indebted to his works.Set in pre-World War II Japan, The Wind Rises is a fictional biography of Jiro Horikoshi; the chief engineer of many fighter planes that were used by the Japanese militia during the war. The plot covers his rise from an ambitious dreamer to one of the most innovative designers of airplanes, and through his life story also covers many events that had significant effects on Japanese infrastructure.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, The Wind Rises is his eleventh & final feature-length film and although it may not be as magical as his most memorable works, it's undoubtedly his most emotional film to date. Appealing more to adults than children, The Wind Rises exquisitely showcases the entire futility of war & how some of the most beautiful creations by mankind was used for their very own destruction.One of Miyazaki's rare films to not feature a female protagonist, The Wind Rises still brims with most of his trademarks and is a delightful nod to aviation, ambition & dream pursuits. The hand-drawn animation is absolutely jaw-dropping to look at for it is extremely detailed, seamlessly rendered & highly realistic in its depiction. Camera-work is brilliantly carried out as well while the editing lets the plot breathe & progress at its own set pace.It's not really difficult to see why The Wind Rises may alienate few Miyazaki fans for it lacks that childlike sense of wonder that has defined every single one of his works, thus making them appeal equally to viewers of all ages. The tone here is much serious, the elements of fantasy as well as pleasant attempts at humour is sorely missing & the narrative as a whole is sentimental, heartbreaking & even emotionally scarring to a considerable extent.On an overall scale, The Wind Rises is another quality addition to a legendary film career that arguably has no equals. This is one rare filmmaker who never actually made a bad film for every single work by him has been a truly magical ride that left me dazzled, entertained & satisfied. His swan song is more or less bittersweet in taste but it is nonetheless fitting for the legend who, in a career spanning half a century, showed us the vast potential of what creative imagination can accomplish & for that alone, he deserves to end his journey on his own terms. And he does!Thank you, for the memories.",

This 126-minute biography does NOT include one second of footage of Mitsubishi Zeros in attack mode; instead it shows Mr. Horikoshi daydreaming, chasing rainbows, flying paper airplanes, fretting over a sick sweetie, and passing out sponge cake to poor kids (there is no historical proof he did any of these things; I've personally done ALL of them, except the sponge cake part--my own food donations for the poor always have been more nutritious than that). On the other hand, there is no disputing that the Mitsubishi A6M Zeros were created for one purpose: to kill as many American men, women, and children as possible! If Californians in general and Disney lackeys in particular want to celebrate that, go right ahead. For the moment, it's sort of a \"free country,\" since America conquered Mr. Horikoshi's Death Machines. I only saw this because it was nominated for an Oscar, and I figured it might be a better version of Pokemon. The lesson to be taken is to read ALL the user reviews BEFORE spending scarce American money to subsidize mendacious revisionism! (Don't be surprised if Mr. Miyazaki builds upon the \"success\" of THE WIND RISES, and buys the cartoon rights from Mel Brooks to SPRINGTIME FOR H!TLER.)",

Also, \"trying to live\" was demonstrated later.But the flaw comes. It mentioned the secret police, but never mentioned the result on Jiro later. From my view, they may want to get the story more reasonable by adding this plot, but to make the story compact, they didn't mention it too much. This is difficult to solve for most people, as there is a paradox between. I have no idea about how to solve that, but I also don't think this story is the best solution.

Always makes you wanna go live in a little cottage house by the country side, surrounded by fields of grass rippling in the wind, clouds and sunshine all day round, etc.I liked the different languages introduced in the film, and sometimes you couldn't even understand it, but it didn't really feel like that mattered anyway. The Italian guy, Caproni, the German.. adds foreignness and artistry to the film.The plot is quite metaphorical and is about hardship, and you can see the title revolves around this. There was one line near the beginning, I think, in French, \"Le vent se l\u00e8ve, il faut tenter de vivre\" (The wind rises, one must try to live).I really enjoyed seeing the main character, Jiro, and Naoko together, but straight away the film tells you it's going to be bittersweet. If you asked a year or two ago, I'd have probably not cared as much. Maybe I'm just getting older haha.I watched the subbed version, although the dub didn't sound too bad actually. I found it kind of weird at the start when the film jumped a few years ahead in continuity and Jiro got older because his voice suddenly sounded very mature. I've heard the dub by Joseph Gordon Levitt was done much better though in that regard.There's a bit of silly and stubborn humour that plays well with some of the characters. I grinned during a few scenes.Good job Miyazaki, you have still managed to make me feel like I was off in another world for a little while.FUN FACT: All the of the sound effects in film were made using human sounds. So if you're planning on watching this, see if you can notice the distinct sound of airplane propellers spinning and revving, or the hissing of steam engines, earthquake noises.. all voiced by some person doing silly things with their mouth to produce those effects! I thought it was pretty funny while watching haha.",

True, there is something admirable about taking on a historical drama and to try to give 'real life' that Ghibli spark of magic, but this movie was just a gigantic portfolio of beautiful animation.The plot was as weak, consistently either underwhelming or anti- climactic, and worst of all ended ambiguously sad, so I left theaters habitually dissatisfied and depressed; The main character is both static and boring, I have no sympathy for this 'perfect man'. Any flaw that tried to give him edge or shape was almost immediately dismissed with some justifying action: ex. As a boy, he's painted as a scrawny, nerdy book worm, justified by confronting a bully and judo throwing him.

The seemingly effortless animation, the trademark Studio Ghibli expressions and style, the side characters (i.e. Jiro's boss, Mr. Kurokawa) so full of life, the background characters who genuinely seem to have personalities of their own, the juxtaposition of classical music with the destruction of Japan, the character study of an altruistic, idealistic man who sees his efforts ultimately go up in flames- The Wind Rises doesn't fit neatly in the typical three act structure of most films, yet despite this lack of the usual narrative arc, it's completely engrossing from start to finish. Though I would still rank Spirited Away as Miyazaki's crowning achievement, this film is, in a way, in a different category from Spirited Away, and many of the other Ghibli movies, for that matter. It lacks any blatantly fantastical character and because of this deals with mature themes such as regret and moral ambiguity in a way that feels much more piercing.That final scene is an unbelievable mix of tragedy and optimism. It's implied that Japan is in ruins thanks to Jiro's work, his wife has succumbed to tuberculosis, and the 10 best years of Jiro's life are behind him. Yet \"live,\" Jiro's deceased wife urges him.

The animation is breathtaking, with the scenery being gorgeous to gawk at and the animation itself fluent. More importantly, the first half of the story and almost everything revolving around planes is really well written. The main character, Jiro, is interesting and well-written. The way he acts is realistic, and it's easy to believe that this guy actually existed. I went into this movie not knowing it was about planes. By the look of the poster art, I thought it was a romance. For the whole first hour and a bit I was just waiting for that to start. The first bit wasn't bad by any means, but I felt like there was more waiting, like we were wasting time or developing characters to make a more effective last act. Then the romantic aspect started and I remember audibly telling the movie \"no stop, go back!\" It was awful. The characters don't spend nearly enough time together on screen to form any chemistry or relationship, and then suddenly they're getting married. It's out of nowhere and I really didn't care at all for their relationship. After that it keeps switching between romance and planes. Again, the planes stuff is cool, but the romance is awful. And this is where the movie gets particularly stupid. Characters make decisions that make no sense whatsoever. I get it, this is based on true events and maybe these decisions were actually made for these reasons, but I don't care about the source material. Make it less accurate for the sake of making a good movie, I don't care. Don't paint this character as a genius then turn him idiot for the last act, it just doesn't make sense. Also the voicing acting is pretty bad. Now I watched the dub, shoot me if you want, I don't care. It's the official dub, so it should hold to the same standard of quality as the original. And it doesn't. Go ahead and tell me to watch the sub because it's 'so much better', but I prefer to watch my movies instead of read them, especially when that option is available professionally. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is awful as Jiro. He's so dull, it's like he's literally reading the script for the first time, not processing a single line and just saying it all. Moreover, John Krasinski as one of his friends is overly excited all the time. And I mean, ALL THE TIME. Yet his character's face looks constantly unimpressed or bored. It's like the voice actors should've been switched. Overall The Wind Rises is not the movie I hoped it'd be. Despite expecting one thing, I enjoyed the other part much more. Only about half this movie is good, and the rest is still littered with no-so- great aspects. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie.",

            "review_title": "THE WIND RISES is an empty exercise in dishonest self-appraisal for animator Miyazaki.",
            "content": "Art is personal. Creative self-expression is, by its very nature, a process of externalizing the internal. Many of your favorite movies, music records, and books were labors of love. But is there a point at which one's art can become too personal? Can dedication and focus breed myopia? In examining Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, I may have found the answer.THE WIND RISES tells a fictionalized account of the life of Jiro Horikoshi, the man responsible for designing Japan's infamous Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter airplane. The aircraft is known for its use during World War II, particularly in the attack on Pearl Harbor and in kamikaze missions. We begin with Jiro as a child in the early 20th century dreaming of flying machines and idolizing seminal figures in the then-young field of aeronautical engineering. Since poor sight will keep the young man from flying an airplane of his own, he attends university in the hopes of building them instead. Each act is ushered in with a scene featuring a strong gust of wind \u2014 a nice bit of theming with the title. The first reel contains some of the best pacing in Studio Ghibli's entire oeuvre. After that, the story throws on the brakes and crawls through a slight, clich\u00e9d recount of the man's endeavors up to just before the notorious event in Hawaii that brought the United States into the second World War.The movie is, as expected, an impressive visual outing by the legendary Studio Ghibli. The candy-coated look that has defined Miyazaki's work since 2001\u2032s Spirited Away is on full display here. The interpretation of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, in which the ground and everything upon it moves like violent ocean waves, is probably the most impressive scene in the picture from an animation perspective. In a departure from Miyazaki's usual fare, there are no cute, strange, or ugly creatures to break up the monotony of animated human beings, but the character designs are attractive and diverse enough to keep things interesting aesthetically.With the knowledge that Miyazaki is somewhat of an aviation fanatic (he has said as much himself), it's surprising how decidedly no-frills the flying sequences are. The two main types of flying scenes are test flights of Horikoshi's designs and dream sequences where he has conversations with famed aeronautical engineer Gianni Caproni. What we get in the test flight sequences are a lot of long wide shots, as though the audience is watching from the ground. The dreams on the other hand are mostly medium shots, two-shots, and close ups that don't really show off the aircraft that the characters are riding. The two most impressive of these scenes is a dream sequence that opens the flick and, somewhat ironically, a scene involving paper airplanes, but nothing quite as exhilarating is ever revisited. We've seen much better flying sequences from the animator in years past, such as in PORCO ROSSO, NAUSICA\u00c4 OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, and CASTLE IN THE SKY.Joe Hisaishi has made a career for himself as a solo artist who happens to score Ghibli films and in doing so has composed some of the greatest scores of all time. The orchestrated soundtrack to this movie is simple in its melodies and assimilates into the emotional atmosphere of every scene. The vocal theme song is lovely but feels like it came out of a decade about halfway between the present and when the movie is set.An astute ear will notice something interesting that has been done with the foley effects. They are, by and large, created with human voices. Things like the mechanical locomotion of a train and the roaring ground during the aforementioned earthquake are given a special kind of vitality that I don't think I've ever experienced in a motion picture before.As Jiro dreams and draws and test flies his creations, we learn little more about the man behind the machine than we did at the title card. Horikoshi is reserved and zealous; this much is clear. A scene early on with his younger sister reveals that he is perhaps neglectful of his family in service of his aspirations. A poignant parallel can be drawn here to Miyazaki, who has been accused of allowing his work to detract from other aspects of his life. The animator even has Jiro smoke Cherry cigarettes, his own brand of choice. The scene with his sister is reflected later when she comes to visit Horikoshi as an adult and complains about his familial inattention yet again. Both scenes outline this character flaw in the engineer but are played for laughs as though 'little sister nags older brother because that's what little sisters do.' The filmmaker clearly admires and relates with his subject, but an abundance of adulation and a lack of honest self-appraisal weaken the core of his most personal work to date.After a couple of aeronautic failures and an exodus to pre-war Germany, our hero finds love. The adroit development of Horikoshi and Naoko Satomi's fictitious relationship is managed over just a couple of scenes, including one mentioned earlier featuring paper airplanes. This portion of the narrative is the most captivating of the picture and is a truly touching depiction of young love. However, the whole thing takes a not-so-surprising turn for the hackneyed when Naoko confesses that she has tuberculosis. I suppose the void of dramatic tension elsewhere in the story forced Hayao's hand, and out popped this done-to-death (pun intended) contrivance. His devotion to his sickly wife plays in contrast to earlier scenes with his younger sister, but because those scenes never cemented the necessary character flaw, the turnaround doesn't feel like much of a redemption.To read the rest of this review, please visit: http://tinyurl.com/l7tm7xu",

Set in WWII, the story of Jiro's dream to make a beautiful plane does not mask the grim reality of Japan's economic and social state, but rather gives hope and light at such a dark time. The historical references intertwined with Miyazaki's own fantasy world is perfectly balanced. The animation is out of this world jolting and vibrant.

            "content": "The wind is rising, we all must live.Since Hayao Miyazaki loved flying, which was made abundantly clear in Porco Rosso and others, this movie felt like his passion project, as well as a tribute. The story was a factionalized version of the real life Jiro Horikoshi, who designed the Japanese Zero airplane during World War II.I loved how Miyazaki portrayed Horikoshi as a kind person who had a dream of building airplane as a kid, and tried to maintain that passion as an actual engineer. The director also showed the main character did not care about the politic or war, but just wanted to make beautiful airplanes for the sake of flying.This led to one of the themes, which was the struggle to maintain a dream, and keeping the dream pure. Another theme was the purpose of airplanes. In a time of war, it was inevitable that airplanes became tools of destruction. Here, Hayao wanted to emphasize that this was not the main purpose. As a person who is obsessed with flying and disdains war, he made his intention quite clear.Another aspect of Horikoshi was the romance with his partner, Naoko. The romance was beautifully and realistically portrayed. They were just young birds that loved and wanted to be with each other. As sweet as the romance was, their story was tragic and heartbreaking.These two aspects of Horikoshi's fictionalized life led to the movie's biggest theme, which was to keep living life to the fullest.My small problems with the movie were some pacing issues, and at the beginning the time jumps were a bit sudden. It took a bit for me to realize that some years had already passed between scenes.Overall, another Hayao Miyazaki's passion project and beautiful movie. 8.5/10.",

Jiros conflict with him wanting to make airplanes that are not used as weapons and the reality that he must make fighter planes for the military or he could never make planes, creates a beautifully tragic light that jiro stars in. The romantic sub plot is also good with how jiro has to sacrifice the happy life he could have with a family for his dream to make planes. At the end of the film you see Jiro looking back at his career just as Giovanni Battista Caproni does in the beginning of the movie. This demonstrates the cycle of innovation and war going hand in hand slightly. Most movies can't touch me on an emotional level with their themes and yet this one did.

Everyone who watches this, regardless of age, should be able to take something away from doing so. But the fact is very few people under the age of twelve will actually make it all the way through until the end, and for something made by a company known as the Japanese Disney, that simply isn't good enough. This makes no real attempt to appeal to anyone except pre-established followers, critics, and mature cinema fans with its honestly quite bland central character, talky script, and there can't be that many eight year old's out there relishing a semi-romantic film based around a workaholic, chain-smoking plane designer in the still early days of flight.

We follow his life until he manages to realize his dream, with all the difficulties he has to face.It's a biography in the form of an animation, which details the life of Jiro, his dreams, his difficulties and his achievements. It's beautifully animated, very atmospheric, dramatic and pleasant. Excellently drawn and colored, it really manages to create an unique atmosphere which takes you away in its lands, making to want more and more of it. Jiro's character is very well developed, presented in many situations, in relation with other great characters which will have a decisive role in his life. The plot is good, although a bit predictable, managing to create a plausible story which the viewer can enjoy until the end. His dreams also play an important role in the outcome, being clearly emphasized by the producers, as they seem to be his main influence and inspiration in his creations. Although interesting throughout its entire length, the movie \"suffers\" from an extremely slow pace. It almost struggles to advance, many scenes seeming over-prolonged, in comparison with what they have to offer. It's not entirely a bad thing, as it contributes in a small amount to the environmental description, but you're bound to notice it and it might as well affect the overall experience.To sum it up, it's a wonderful piece of animation, but, for which I believe that you have to be in a certain mood to fully enjoy.

The way the people just dodge the train already narrates you the culture and attitude of an early 1900's japan. Not to say that even a engineering task made by the protagonist are filled with excitement. Attention to detail it's always present on Ghibli movies, and this it's no exception.And of course, the main story never diverts from the protagonist and always follows him, through what basically will become the most important part of his life, and a wonderful tale on following your dreams with tenacity and enjoyment, but also on how people can be joined to produce things that are way more than the sum of it's parts.If you live in the US, go and watch it, enjoy, just relax, read every careful detail that the movie shows you, foreground and background, and at the same time support a movie where your intelligence never gets insulted and your emotion sync up perfectly with the tale. Truly a master piece. Hope movies like this never run out.",

The story follows Jiro Horikoshi, the inventor of the Japanese Zero during World War II and the story centers on his work with airplanes and his romance with Nahoko Satomi who is deathly sick. All Jiro wants is to create beautiful airplanes.The film is gorgeous all the way to the last frame. The direction is spot on, which is to be expected by a top notch director. The English voice work is very well done and the whole story just keeps you enticed until the very end. It teaches that dreams can be destroyed by war and disease but they will always live on to new horizons.I can't really find any negative thoughts for this film just maybe a slow part in the middle but it was necessary. The story is also very tragic basically documenting the downfall of Japan. As they mention throughout the film \"Japan is going to explode...\" And if you know your history it does. The film is an absolute masterwork and this is from someone who is not altogether a huge anime or Studio Gibli fan. This is definitely a film I would own and watch again.",

I didn't expect what I saw. The story line was brilliant. It focuses on the life of Jiro, a man who loves planes and aviation but can't become a pilot because of his vision problems. His story is heartwarming and sad. The other characters are all as lovable as he is. Stidio Ghibli is known for it's breathtaking animation, and this film is no exception. The art is wonderful; the colors vibrant. It was one of the most visually beautiful films I have seen. The soundtrack is another work of art from Joe Hisaishi. I would recommend this film to any Ghibli fan, or anyone who appreciates animation. It is well worth your time. \"The wind is rising, we must try to live.\"",

            "content": "Biographical drama. The film adaptation of the manga of the same name by Hayao Miyazaki, who acted as a screenwriter and director here, so you don't have to worry about the original source. The original source itself is based on the biography of Jiro Horisoka, a Japanese aircraft designer who created the famous Japanese Air Force Zero fighter and a number of other aircraft. I saw this cartoon back in the year of its release (I even have a DVD disc), and then I really liked it, and now, even when I watched it again, the impressions remained the same. And here is my brief opinion for you - The difficult history of the Japanese aircraft designer. I will note right away that I did not notice any shortcomings in this cartoon, but there is one remark that needs to be mentioned. In the meantime, I will focus your attention on the merits of this work by Miyazaki San.So, here they are:\n1. Scenario - this cartoon is based on the biography of Jiro Horisoka, shows his path from an enthusiastic boy driven by a dream to an adult and independent man, already burdened with life experience and having found a family. Of course, part of the true biography of this man has been changed for the sake of artistry, but in general, the cartoon follows historical facts quite accurately. And Jiro's fate and life itself was far from simple, but his optimism in life and following his dream, as well as full dedication to his work, helped him become famous all over the world and thereby write off his name in world history. If you like biographical dramas, then don't miss this cartoon.2. The love line - not only is it adequately and logically inscribed here, but it is worked out no worse. There is that \"spark\" between Jiro and Naoko, without which romance is not romance. The story turned out to be romantic and tragic, full of tenderness and warmth, tears and despair, hope and hopelessness. Such stories are very popular with viewers all over the world, and this one was no exception.3. Aviation - for fans of this topic, it's just a joy here, because here you will be shown the development of aircraft construction from the tenth years of the twentieth century to the mid-forties. The aircraft of Japan, the Soviet Union, Germany, the USA, and Italy will be presented. The difficulties of creating aircraft, the technical problems encountered in their design and production, the direction of engineering thought, and so on will be shown. Miyazaki San did not forget about everyday life and the historical context, because the action takes place in the interwar period and when the Second World War was already aflame. A bit of politics was also involved, but it was impossible without it.4. Follow the dream - this is the main message of this cartoon, because it was these words that made Jiro come up with and construct his most famous work, and which always helped him not to fall into apathy and not to give up in difficult moments of life. After all, it is the dream that makes people do the impossible, it is the dream that inspires madness, and it is the dream that can throw up an idea that can turn our whole life around. And this cartoon perfectly shows and proves it.Now about the remark. And we are talking here about several episodes from the beginning of the cartoon, which abruptly end, and which were clearly cut out during editing. It's just that these episodes start suddenly and end just as suddenly. Then it was necessary either to cut them out completely, or to make the transitions much smoother.And then I remembered another remark. The fact is that Miyazaki San almost does not touch on the topic of the Sino-Japanese and World War II, or rather swings only in those places when Japan itself is bombed, but when Mitsubishi planes (both bombers and the famous Zero fighters) bomb China, the Philippines and so on - it is marked only a couple of shots, which only show a couple of Chinese fighters trying to protect their land from the Japanese invaders. Yes, Jiro himself says that he is upset that his planes bring only death and destruction, but it looks extremely hypocritical. I'm sorry, but I don't believe that a person who has worked most of his life in the largest aviation company, whose customers were the army and navy, will be so naive and will only be \"upset\". Here Miyazaki San is clearly trying to whitewash his country so that people forget the monstrous cruelty that the Japanese were famous for at that time (one beheading with samurai swords is worth it, or the Nanjing massacre).A little about the main characters:\n1. Jiro Horisoki is a talented aircraft designer, a kind and sympathetic person, a workaholic, following a dream. All his life he has been trying to create a real masterpiece of aircraft construction, which he successfully manages.2. Naoko Satomi is Jiro's lover and then wife, a talented artist who fell in love with Jiro at first sight. Unfortunately, he suffers from a monstrous disease, which leaves an imprint on their entire life together.3. Kiro Honjo is a friend and colleague of Jiro, with whom they will go from young idealists to talented aircraft designers. I am always happy to help a friend with advice and more than once helps him in solving complex problems.At the moment, this is the last work of Miyazaki San. He is already many years old, and let's hope that he will live for a long time, giving this world more than one of his author's works, because his name is already inscribed in the history of animation. And I was glad to see and review these four of his works (Carried Away by Ghosts, Nausicaa from the Valley of the Winds, The Witch's Delivery Service, The Wind is getting Stronger). After all, each of these works is worthy of your time and your attention, because it really is art with a capital letter \"And\".As a result, we have a good biographical cartoon, with a good script, good music, a great message, but with a couple of comments.My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

Its really good and heartbreaking. I cried a lot with that movie. Although there is some bump in their way with their recently \"bad\" movie in my opinion like \"When Marnie Was There\" (2014), \"From Up on Poppy Hill\" (2011) and \"Tales from Earthsea\" (2006). From my honest opinion, from all 21 Ghibli film, just 4 don't really works on me. Its still good, a lot of people praise them except for the \"Tales from Earthsea\" (2006). I think in this new age, Ghibli wants to try some heavy drama stuff. That's what they keep making this serious stuff like Marnie and this Jiro Horikoshi biopic. But, I think the genre that Ghibli is really good at is children movie, family,fantasy, fun and all. I never said that \"The Wind Rises\" is bad but its quite boring sometime and I think the thing that save this movie is his love story, background music, gorgeous animation and its ending. It does make me cry a bit too. Other than that, when they talk about the plane, engineer and everything, its looks like out of place and uninteresting. It will be really suit for live action movie, but not for anime, its really heavy for anyone who just want to enjoy some Ghibli fun time. Similar stuff happen with Marnie too. Nevertheless, Ghibli is still the best and I hope they can come up with best work of their \"genre\", again. Maybe the sequel of Ponyo will be nice I guess.",

            "content": "I think 'How's Moving Castle' was the first feature-length film that was announced as being Miyazaki's last. But ten years and two feature films later, has the great director finally decided to call it a day? With 'Ponyo' since being his second last ever film, now 'The Wind Rises' is the next film to make the claim and, given its subject matter and style, is probably as good a place as any to call it a day. Telling the story of real-life human: Japanese aeronautics engineer Horikoshi Jiro, designer of Japanese fighter planes used during the Second World War. Now, this is always going to be a touchy subject matter to tackle and would seemingly be a move away from his previous films. However, Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki himself have previously made films as serious and adult in theme as this. But what this does mean is that some of the more mythical elements of his previous films are not present.With a brief look at his childhood years, the film quickly moves to his time at University before his starting work at the Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Company, where he would start to design war planes. But, fear not. This is not a biopic that could have been made as a live- action film full of dull moments. Looking at his dreams, we follow Jiro's desire to create beautiful flying machines from a young age. But, as the film progresses and the reality of designing planes as an engineer during war time, the dreams become visions of the destruction his creations will bring. Numerous references are made to life's ironies throughout, and this is the one apparent by the film's conclusion. While all of his film's have an appeal to adults as well as children, 'The Wind Rises' feels more adult: less happy in its ending and more along the lines of Ghibli's other wartime film, 'Grave of the Fireflies'. But, the magic is still there. 'The Wind Rises' is positive in its telling of a boy's dream to create what he loves and how Jiro's intentions were only ever to do good, rather than a desire to destroy, ending with an emotional finale, feeling an appropriate place for Miyazaki to call it a day. But, as 'Howl's Moving Castle' and 'Ponyo' have proved, never say 'never.'",

            "content": "The Wind Rises has a lot of the same charm that has made Hayao Miyazaki's films so great, but although it is a good film on its own, it ultimately feels slightly shallow when placed amongst films like Spirited Away and Nausica\u00e4: Valley of the Wind. It does not have the well-roundedness that these other films do and has less creative flourishes to bail it out. However it is still very entertaining and should definitely not be considered a bad film, indeed far from it.The film is about Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed fighter planes for Japan in the Second World War. The story is interesting, but ironically suffers from being too cut off from reality. This is something which would not normally be a problem in Miyazaki's films, which are able to leave the real world at whatever point they wish without any consequence. However, this film is too directly linked to the real world is too explicit in its reference to simply ignore it, which it does. It doesn't explore the morality of Jiro's inventions being used in the war enough, and this subject almost feels like an afterthought. Of course, this attitude does in part reflect his innocence in that he is simply an engineer who dreams to invent an aeroplane, but it becomes quite frustrating due to this being so close to the narrative and is simply driven past. Jiro is perhaps floating in the clouds like his inventions, which is acceptable, but does not stop it from being frustrating. He is never held accountable or really confronted very much by the idea that his planes are used for war. Whatever he is made aware of feels overly romanticised and cannot help but seem too far removed from the main plot.However, the films premise is still enough to adequately move the story forward, and there are many engaging passages in the film which really convey the sense of passion that Jiro has for his work. The dream sequences are interesting, and paint an interesting picture of how someone follows their \"dreams\", so to speak.The animation is very pretty and manages to hold the Studio Ghibli feel. Although it is slightly lacking in imagination compared to some past films, it is still gorgeous to look at.The film in a way suffers not unlike to what Howls Moving Castle suffered from. This is that the second half of the film feels slightly weaker because it is not able to juggle its ambitious ideas from the first half into a balanced conclusion. However Howls Moving Castle is a noticeably better film compared to The Wind Rises, perhaps because of its more imaginative animation and story which were able to excuse not having a perfect balance. The Wind Rises doesn't have this same luxury, and feels slightly isolated in some ways after a certain point in the film. In short, the scenes with the planes and the workers are very engaging, but the love interest weighs the film down a bit. It is an interesting premise the way Jiro and Nahoko meet but I always felt as though that part of the plot was always running its course in a too predictable way.Viewing the film on its own, without the shadow of Miyazaki's past work bearing down on it, the film looks quite a lot better and this is certainly a tribute to the quality of films Miyazaki has released in his long career. Yet the way this film was billed as his \"last film\" (although this now looks very unlikely) its inevitably going to be viewed alongside his other works. However, even though there are quite a large number of films better than this in the Miyazaki catalogue, it is still a welcome addition to the collection (only just).3.5/5 stars http://totellyouagain.blogspot.co.uk/",

For a man who is God-like in his telling of a fantastical story, it's so much a pleasant surprise to see him share a story from a very human level. And it only goes to prove why Miyazaki is one of the greatest storytellers to ever exist.The Wind Rises is partly a bio-pic, but told through the animated medium about an engineer who designed fighter planes for Japan during the second World War. The movie at its core, is a love letter to makind in its ambition to set the stage for future innovation. \"Inspiration unlocks the future, technology will catch up\" is a sentence that very accurately sums up the spirit of this movie.I don't think there is anything one can hate about this movie.

The story line is not clear at all and during the movie I wondered if there were some scenes cut because they just didn't add up. Why would Jiro always have dream and meet the Italian in his dream? I think this is what Hayao Miyazaki did on purpose. Let me explain.He wants to talk about Jiro's life. One remarkable chapter of this person's life was his invention of the Zero, which was the best aircraft of the time. It really kicked American asses for quite a while. So, if Hayao wants to recount Jiro's life events, Zero would be unavoidable. Then if he does so he would be accused of calling Japanese militarism, which antagonizes the Chinese and Korean very much. (Oh by the way this movie is not going to show in China, what a pity.) Or he could minimize the exposure of Zero on the scene, but that would leave a hole in his recount for sure. So Hayao faces this task that he has to give the Zero some exposure but not too much. The fact that he cannot bring a whole chunk of Zero related events to the movie(which are equally important to Jiro's biography and the movie's completeness) already makes the story line very thin, so he has to add in new character and plots---the Italian. So you see, Hayao's hands are tied because the topic he chose is very sensitive, this dooms the movie.I don't blame him for making such a flop, I just pity as this is his last piece of work. I do like his other movies though.",

I thought that the idea of a historical drama about the man who engineers airplanes would not be interesting enough to justify a 2-hour runtime. Well, if you were worried about that, you can put those fears to rest, the movie is riveting.Like all Studio Ghibli films, the animation is beautiful. There are dream sequences where Miyazaki can really play with the art style. All the details he adds to each scene is breathtaking. Even the simple flare he adds to the glasses of the main character adds so much to the charm of the picture.The voice acting by all the characters is top notch. If I had one nitpick it would be Joseph Gordon Levitt as Jiro. His whole performance stays within the same monotone delivery. Most of the time it works for the character, but there are some emotional moments where he falls short. The music by Joe Hisaishi is awesome, it would be a good soundtrack to listen to on its own.What I find at the core of this film is Jiro's passion for his work. His unrelenting desire to engineer a better airplane. He is able to take something that I would normally have little interest in and make it fascinating. As much as he loves engineering those planes, there may be something he loves even more. And that is the heart and soul of this movie.Yes, the movie could have used its time better, could have had some tighter editing. But in the end, this is another great hit for Miyazaki.",

The real wife of Jiro Horikoshi gave birth to five of the engineer's children.As for the film, I'll give a review of 7/10. Well detailed and a well made movie. It's a Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli film, so I'm not surprised.The only ire raging inside is that of a false life fictionalization of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter creator Jiro Horikoshi, the aircraft which was the cause of mass wreck throughout the Pacific Theater. Director Miyazaki's father, Katsuji Miyazaki and his firm 'Miyazaki Airplanes' manufactured Zero fighters for Imperial Japan. I don't know if it was deliberate Imperial Japanese glorification or sympathy from the Director, we have to remember that the Imperial Japanese were tried for war crimes and major figures were sentenced to death for their deeds. The studio shouldn't stoop low to glorify their country's evil past.If you had sympathy for this film, especially from a fictionalized Naoko Satomi (who never existed in Jiro Horikoshi's real life) and the great destruction wrecked worldwide by Horikoshi's Zero Aircraft, that's fine because you know the truth now. But if you continue to sympathize despite all the above truths, **** you. You might not realize if your own country might've suffered from the Imperial Japanese, or your ancestors fought in the past to end their tyranny.

The tragic love story between a man pursuing his dream and a girl afflicted by (at least then) an incurable disease touched me in the same way an ill-fated romance movie would have, and based off that emotional bridge that Miyazaki so eloquently built...his movie received high praise from me.On second thought, this movie was far from the traditional Ghibli film and overall was one of the weakest plot-wise. Sans the traditional expectations of a Ghibli movie (the talking animals, the sprinkle of magic, the infusion of various European architecture into a rural Japan, etc.), it was a shaky plot that seemed to eager to follow the true story of Jiro while forcing in as much incoherent fantasy references as possible. The love story, albeit one containing boatloads of human emotion and the standard perseverance, was not developed well from the beginning. Sometimes a nontraditional love story will work, but with Jiro seemingly slipping in and out of who he really is during the course of the film, it is hard to create a solid foundation when the characters are not truly well defined. Jiro has to be one of the few leading characters in a Ghibli movie I failed to make any true connection with, and I found him to be a relatively dull and uneventful character.This brings me to the abrupt ending. It did leave me in complete silence, and it took me to the end of \"Hikouki Kumo\" to realize that the movie was over and Jiro's story, at least as far as we were concerned, ended with his final dream sequence and his tears of achievement and sheer loss. It was without a doubt a well-crafted, touching ending that left many of those around me in tears, yet it was not a fulfilling ending. Perhaps it was Miyazaki's wish to leave the audience with that profound sense of emptiness when they realize that Satomi chooses to leave Jiro, and he is content with letting her die alone in the mountains. Regardless, Jiro's \"triumph\" at the end is bittersweet, and somewhat conflicts everything he stood for from the beginning to the end.What Miyazaki and Ghibli has done with this movie is a brave venture, and the gamble did pay off to certain respects. It is a mature film; nowhere near Grave of the Fireflies, but definitely will allow you to carry a heavy heart after watching it. Expectations regarding Ghibli aside, the weak plot and weak main character takes away from what would have been an excellent film.",

Studio Ghibli has always done something amazing and epic were it takes you far away. In this film its real but still has that since of wonder and imagination. The Film Follows Jiro a Japanese kid who wants to build a plane and loves planes when in the end of it all he builds a war plane that would kill millions of people when all he wanted to do was build a beautiful air plane. Throughout out the film he keeps having theses day dreams with this French air plane designer they are always talking in one scene \"The french designer\" says \"Air planes are beautiful and amazing things to take flight and be engulfed in the sky to never return\". Over all this film has a very Studio Ghibli Anti war feeling to it same with \"Grave of the firefly\" \"From up on poppy hill\" \"Princess Mononoke\" and pretty much all of his films have a very Anti war theme to them. My favorite part was in the end *Spoiler Alert* Where Jiro is walking through this like grave yard of destroyed air planes and destruction and death when he walks through it and he see's a hill where he sees the french designer and he says \"Do you remember this place Japanese boy?\" Jiro says \"Yes this is the first place we met\" then the french designer says you have some one waiting for you\" Jiro sees his wife and she says \"you have to live on do you hear me you have to live on\" then disappears You hear the french designer say \"She was very beautiful\" \"Now lets stop by my place i have some nice wine\" Then he walks away The its just Jiro standing on the hill where he says \"thank you, Thank you for this adventure\" then he walks down the hill and it fades to black and after the credits it says \"The End\". That thank you Jiro says at the end of the film is Hayao Miyazaki saying thank you for coming with me on all these adventures thank you for being there. Thank you and Farewell.",

It takes the love he put into Porco Rosso for early 20th century aviation and brings it on a step, covering aviation engineering, a subject lacking in adventure, even if it does have a certain romance.The Zero fighter invented by the film's main character Jiro Horikoshi is a touchstone of Japanese culture which, I maintain, has had a greater impact on them than is often realized. However, its position in the center of this film has caused controversy because it raises the spectre of Japan's ignominious World War II record. Their flat refusal to acknowledge abuses like their treatment of prisoners of war has soured international relations for decades, and stubbornly glamorizing the War is a typical thing for them to do.However, while The Wind Rises does not exactly tackle these issues head-on, I was satisfied by how it deflected them. This is not a film about a machine of death, it is about the romance of flight, the joy of fantasy and how people are willing to endure hard work and repeated failure to follow their dreams.To this end, the inclusion of famed director Hideaki Anno as the voice of Jiro is a surprising but salutary one. Anno is something of an anime legend in his own right, but a more esoteric one. I compare it to David Lynch starring in a Martin Scorsese film. Anno's voice is perfect for this role though: no heroic baritone but thin, reedy, nerdy. The Wind Rises is about a high-minded dreamer, and the surprising nobility which emerges from that. I just hope others realize this as I did.",

            "content": "The Wind Rised is a fictionalized biographical film about Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese aeronautical engineer who designed military aircrafts before and during WWII. WWII is still a sensitive topic, especially for people as myself who is from neighbouring countries which were deeply hurt by Japan. The Wind Rises is about a man's dream of designing planes. Unfortunately his designs were used for war purposes. In this movie, the real events became a faded background. Miyazaki told the story from a very narrow personal respective. You don't feel the war affected the characters in the story in a deep way. I think I cannot enjoy the story. Speaking of war-themed Studio Ghibli movies, I was moved by Grave of the Fireflies. But I cannot say the same about The Wind Rises.Besides chasing the dream of designing aircrafts, The Wind Rises is also a love story. There are a few touching moments. But such precious moments were rather pale in an era of wars and tragedies. Visually, the movie is okay, but not as breathtaking as Studio Ghibli's previous movies (as I remembered). There are a lot of smoking scenes, and a few kissing scenes. I can't remember if there were kissing scenes in other Studio Ghibli movies. For a moment, I wondered if there would be a sex scene. Oh no, it didn't happen ;pTo sum up, The Wind Rises is a disappointment as a swan song from such an accomplished director. Afterall, telling a story based on real persons and events is just not his strong suit.",

Yet being together and smoking is more important than getting her cured, so instead he does work & smokes while holding her wife's hand.In the end it just seems that \"it is sad, but can't help, lets keep dreaming of aircraft and perhaps smoking\"This is what the movie left me feeling, i understand that your feelings might be different. But for me, it was just about some well of guy having wife tragically dying, whilst he was all about smokes and aircraft.For me this is actually a quite huge spoiler, since not much else happened in the movie, but perhaps other people have different perspectives.",

            "content": "I've always been a huge fan of Miyazaki ever since I first saw KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, but for his supposed swan song, I honestly don't know what to think. Perhaps because of this, I cannot rate it as highly as his other films. Don't get me wrong, THE WIND RISES is not a bad film at all. It's as colorful and beautifully animated as any Ghibli movie, and of course Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime. There are also moments that truly do recall Miyazaki at his most imaginative. But if you're expecting another movie filled with action, wonders, and magic as his other movies, you will probably be disappointed, because THE WIND RISES is as far removed from the rest of Miyazaki's output than even his less fantasy-oriented pictures. Rather than aiming for the exuberant joy and wonders of LAPUTA, TOTORO, the dark, epic spectacles of MONONOKE, NAUSICAA, and even the surrealistic SPIRITED AWAY and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, this movie is mostly down to earth, with only the occasional moments of pure spectacle. It's also his most \"adult\" film to date; perhaps because of this, THE WIND RISES is also cursed with the misfortune of being Miyazaki's least accessible film.Although financially successful in Japan, THE WIND RISES has not been without its share of detractors, particularly Miyazaki's target audience. Controversially, the protagonist of this story is Jiro Horikoshi, the man who was responsible for creating some of deadliest airplane bombers during World War II. In fact, this film is very loosely based on his account. Naturally, one would expect that Horikoshi would be portrayed as a tyrant considering the outcome of his crafts. But in a rather daring and almost dangerous move, Miyazaki presents the man as a gentle, ambitious soul who simply wants to achieve his dream of flying rather than as a psychopath bent on destruction.Speaking of dreams, the most memorable sequences in the movie are those which involve Jiro's fantasies of being airborne. In one such scene, an extensive, dialogue-free prologue which opens the film, we see young Jiro wake up from his countryside home, climb to the roof and board an elaborately customized craft, soaring across the Japanese countryside to the strains of Joe Hisaishi's typically melodic score. Otherwise, the rest of the \"dream\" scenes (interspersed throughout the languidly paced story) feature Jiro interacting with the charismatic Italian aircraft designer Caproni. \"Airplanes are beautiful dreams,\" intones the air designer to the short-sighted Jiro who he refers to as \"Japanese boy\", \"Engineers turn dreams into reality.\"For the rest of the film, we follow Jiro as he grows into adulthood; a forty-year cycle of a journey that unfolds in over two hours. Regrettably, this is also one of the film's biggest shortcomings: not only are the scenes involving Jiro's growth less intriguing than his flights of fancy, they slow the movie's momentum to a snail's pace. Miyazaki is no stranger to producing movies that push over the two hour mark, but THE WIND RISES feels even longer than that, with most of the scenes being slow, drawn-out conversations between Jiro and his colleagues.Aside from the aforementioned \"imagination\" bits, the only other major highlight of THE WIND RISES happens about a third of the way through in which an earthquake literally tears through Japan and causes a passing train to derail and crash spectacularly. This is arguably my favorite moment of the movie because it showcases Miyazaki at his most visceral. The execution of the tragedy is powerfully conveyed through the dramatic staging and animation.Alas, such moments are tragically undercut by the film's much more languid second half, which shoehorns a tragic love story involving a gentle painter woman whose internal clock is ticking. I don't know if it is just me, but neither Jiro nor his lover Naoko come across as particularly compelling characters, and perhaps because of this, we are given little reason to care about them. A \"courting\" scene in which Jiro attempts to fly a paper airplane to Naoko's balcony is inspiring, but that's about as interesting as this love story gets.More detrimental, unfortunately, is the dub by Disney, which is surprisingly disappointing considering I've always loved the studio's English work for Ghibli's films. Sadly, this is their worst, the performance I found to be the weakest being that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Although well cast, he proves, I'm sorry to say, the dullest performance in any Disney dub I've ever listened to. Emily Blunt fares a little better as Naoko, but the love scenes between her and Levitt are shockingly ineffective: however much emotion Blunt gives, Levitt's distressingly wooden performance sadly nullifies any bit of chemistry between the two. That said, I did enjoyed Martin Short, Mae Whitman, Stanley Tucci, and Werner Hertzop's turns -- all four are terrific, especially Short's delightfully irascible Kurotowa and the charismatic, charming Tucci as Caproni. But everyone else didn't strike me as compelling one way or another.Perhaps another major problem I have is the ending; while the fate of the love story isn't hard to guess, but Miyazaki instead chooses to close the film with yet another dream sequence. Instead of coming across as a genuine conclusion, this last scene feels strangely unresolved. What happens to Jiro after the scene? What became of his career? Sadly, the movie doesn't answer any of these questions, and as such, the denouement doesn't feel like a genuine conclusion. It's almost as if Miyazaki ran out of creative juice and decided to stop his movie on an uneasy note.Still, take my complaints with a grain of salt and go see THE WIND RISES. Even if it is by no means Miyazaki's best film, the moments that truly excel really show that a genius such as Miyazaki never ceases to amaze, whether at his most vigorous or his most down to earth.",

            "review_title": "dissapointing, inconsistent and no charm",
            "content": "I watched \"the wind rises\" for the first time back when it came out and i remember beeing very dissapointed with it. Now 4 years later I finaly rewatched the movie and I have to say, my opinion didnt change at all.I think the movie has 2 major problems. One is that the movie has no focus. The movie is about 2 hours long and tries to cover the life of plane engineer Jirou Horikoshi, with his childhood, his experience with the Tokyo earthquake of 1923, his travels to europe, his plane building career and his love life with his wife. In addidtion to all of that the movie has a lot of dream sequences. I think of all these aspects only the dream sequences seemes finished, everything else is just an unfinished product, cut short of what its suppost to be. Take his wife for example: they spend so little time introducing his wife and his relationship to her that ultimately we, as the audience dont care about her and everything that happens to her. I mean, really , what do we know about his wife?... that she likes to paint and loves the main character... thats it. The parts the movie should have focused on (the plane building parts) where cut short and rushed to find time for unecessary \"slice of life\" elements half way through the film. This completely ruins the tone of the movie.The second major problem is the main character. He is too unemotional and boring. His life goal is to create planes, but did we ever see him get upset when one of his designes didnt work, or really happy when it does?\nSure Japan has a more emotionless culture but at home when he is not under people there should have been at least a few scenes where we can see his frustration or joy. Nothing is seen from this character. He succeed in so many parts that he as a character seems so unrealisticly anyways( he is a genius plane designer, speaks multiple languages, is physically strong, etc). All characters around him have more emotion and feel more realisitc than this guy.The art of the movie was fine, it was the usual ghibli style but I find unusual that many scenes seemed kinda weird, either out of propotion or unrealisitic stuff happens (like the earthquake).The sounddesign was not so fine, the soundtrack itself was fine and the voiceacting as well, but often backgroundnoises where cut to such a minimum that the whole scene seemed unrealisitc. Its such a weird design choice.So now I go into a few minor things that bug me about this movie. First of all, at the start of the movie the main character defends a young kid, which kinda tells you he has some sense of justice, which then later was completely contradicted by the fact that he builds warplanes. Sure I can understand him for just building plane for the purpose of building planes, but activley helping a nation that kills millions of people in war (an he should know that, I mean he hangs around foreingers all the time) is at least worthy of discussion. In my opinion they should have given his sister this sense of justice and SHE should have confronted him with this dilemma... he then defends himself and we understand him as a character better. The way it is, the main character hardly ever talks about his point of view or his opinion about MANY things going on around him, which is weird since the movie is a biography about the dude.Second point: In the japanese version his wife yells \"Nicu catchu\" in the scene where he catches the umbrella. A very weird thing to say and it more reminds me of Japanese spoken in modern times than back then. Sure she has been around foreigners, but then she would have a better accent. Its just something I saw in no other movie depicting Japan before WW2, which is btw a lot.Third and last point: the ending is very unfulfilling and weird. The dialoge spoken in most of the dream sequences is utterly idiotic and shallow but the ending takes the cake. They always speak about Japan blowing up, the millions of life it will cost isnt even worth wrapping your head around, it seems. Then the Italien says something like: \"Why would the pilots want to come back from war anyways?\"... I dont know, maybe to live their lifes? It seems like the dreamsequences wanted to be profound and symbolic but it came around as more shallow and idiotic in my opinion.So in gerneral: This movie was terrible. If it wasn't for the sudden inclusion of slice of life romance half way through and the idiotic ending I could have accepted it as a decent shallow movie about an emotionless character building planes. The movie would have been pretty boring for everyone not interested into planes or technology in general but it would have been a nice watch for me. Now the only thing that makes this movie watchable was the artstyle and maybe the premise, but you sure notice that the premise tricks you into such a flat storyline.",

Ever since then, I loved their films and this one is definitely one of the greats. The storyline, although fictional when it comes to the protagonist such as his wife's dramatic illness, was very emotional and you can feel very sorry for him as well. In reality, he was highly against the second world war and had never dreamed that Japan would never win the war. The love he has for designing planes was great and gives a message out to everyone that planes aren't used to be weapons, they are meant to be beautiful, which the designer in the film had once murmured, according to Miyazaki, 'All I want was to make something beautiful'. The development of the main character was good and the animation...my god, it was fanf***ingtastic! It was fluid, it was creative, it's art. Ghibli's films have the greatest form of traditional animation, it's up there with the likes of Disney. It's sad that this was Hayao Miyazaki's last film and I think he went out on a high note, it's wonderful, it's emotional and the anti war message, although very small, is shown through interpretation. I know that this film had gained a lot of controversy in Japan last year because of that, but films like 'Graves of the Fireflies' seem more like an anti-war film and where is the criticism for that? I know that the director wasn't going for an anti-war message in that film, but when you see it you can feel it.I'm looking forward to this movie on Blu-Ray, it's not only one of my favourite Ghibli films, not only one of my favourite animated films, but it's one of my favourite movies period.",

            "content": "\"Inspiration unlocks the future.\" Released in Japan as Kaze Tachinu (\u98a8\u7acb\u3061\u306c), \"The Wind Rises\" is a 2013 Japanese animated historical drama film based on an original story written and directed by the anime master himself Hayao Miyazaki, which was adapted from his own manga of the same name. But first, a little history. The movie was loosely based on a 1937 short story of the same name by Tatsuo Hori\u2014a writer, poet and translator from mid-20th century (Sh\u014dwa period) Japan. This era in Asia was potentially a \"period of enlightened peace/harmony\" or \"period of radiant Japan\". It was the time when Japanese history corresponded to the reign of the Sh\u014dwa Emperor, Hirohito, from Dec. 25, 1926 through Jan. 7, 1989. \"The Wind Rises\" is a fictionalized biography of Jiro Horikoshi (1903-1982), designer of the Mitsubishi A5M and its successor, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and of whose life Miyazaki pays tribute in chronicling. But does Miyazaki's last work truly take flight? Let's take a look.Set in early 1918 Japan, a bespectacled boy named Jiro Horikoshi (voiced for American audiences by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young kid with giant dreams and aspirations of flight, living in a provincial town. We first see him as a boy, having a dream about climbing up onto his roof donning aviator goggles and taking off in a bird-like plane. Suddenly a large, monstrous ship emerges from the clouds, dropping anthropomorphic bombs on him as his plane tailspins and plummets to the ground. He awakens but has another dream later on in the film where he meets Carponi, (Stanley Tucci) an famous Italian aeronautical plane designer, posing also as the a mentor for the eager lad as well. Carponi tells Jiro that he cannot fly a plane with glasses, but teaches him that the art and passion of building aircraft is better than flying aircraft itself. Jiro awakens again and decides to construct planes that will truly push the technological envelope. Five years later, traveling by train back to Tokyo after holiday from studying engineering at a university, he meets a young girl named Naoko (Emily Blunt) who is also traveling with her maid. Enter the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and the train grinds to a halt, causing the maid to break her leg. Jiro then delivers the maid and Naoko to their family and then walks away without revealing his name. Jiro then goes on to become an airplane manufacturer, assigned to a fighter design team, which ends in disaster. He is sent to Germany to do technical research and obtain a production license for a Junkers aircraft. While there, Jiro dreams of Carponi again, who further mentors him amidst his discouragement. He runs into his love interest Naoko again in 1932 at a summer resort. He is happy to see her but feels disappointed as well, as he had now been promoted the position of the chief designer for a fighter plane competition that had also ended in disaster. Jiro confesses his love of Naoko later on to her father, and Naoko overhears and accepts. But having been afflicted with an incurable case of tuberculosis, she refuses to marry him as she is later sent away to an alpine sanatorium. As her health continues to deteriorate, the love between the two grows ever stronger, right up to the day when Jiro's prototype of what would become the Mitsubishi A5M takes to the skies. Ending in a dream sequence, Carponi tells Jiro that his dreams and inspirations were nonetheless realized as Naoko appears in his dream for the final time, urging her husband to live on in the trust she had thus placed within him.This film is a fittingly bittersweet farewell to the great director Miyazaki; a somber sayonara to one of the greatest masters of anime. At seventy-three years old, his vision and scope throughout this particular art form over the decades his indeed pushed the boundaries of where this medium could possibly go, creating a whole new level all on its own and into the hearts of all who have loved and grown up watching his beloved albeit haunting films. His retirement after a long career of meticulous drawings he shared with the world will and should always be cherished that originated from the mind of a man who performed glorious yet sometimes disturbing magic with the tip of a pencil. Miyazaki's movies will always continue to emanate his essence with each viewing, reminding viewers that his passion for what he did has indeed touched a certain place in all of us that evoked a moment of laughter, tears or deep and eloquent thought about the God-given beauty that surrounds us everyday with a newer understanding, within a 2D environment. He awoke a realm of imagination and fantasy from its slumber and made it his, sharing it with everyone and anyone who are willing to really open their minds to embrace his creations and worlds on an entirely new and unfamiliar spectrum.\"The Wind Rises\" might be Miyakazi's most mature film to date. Although the drawings lack a bit in detail compared to his earlier films, the depth is still there, along with the means of telling a meaningful story of endearment, tragedy and love. With echoes of \"Grave of the Fireflies\" and \"Spirited Away,\" this film both reveals a fantasy/drama and knows when to show this without falling into schmaltz, despite its turbulent surroundings. From flights of the imagination to the horrors of WWII amidst Germany-occupied Japan, Miyazaki again does not disappoint in his last magnum opus to his Eastern and Western audiences alike. Inspiring, bold and rapturously beautiful, \"The Wind Rises\" is an innovative yet melancholy swan song of the visionary amine wizard, who indeed adapted this very concept and truly took it to new and incredible heights; a film that will continue to soar long after the successful career of the great anime artiste.",

You very much want to see him succeed.Nahoko was good too. Her and Jiro's romance was a little underdeveloped, but also a great balance of cute & tragic. It works as a good emotional centre to the film.Kayo didn't have too much development but she was still really likeable nonetheless.And I did not expect Mr Kurokawa to be as important as he was, but he ended up being one of my favourite characters. He's also quite funny in certain scenes. And even though I barely understood any of the \"plane talk\" it was always fascinating to listen to.The film's very slow pacing can leave it feeling a bit messy in places, but it also occasionally kinda adds to the film's beauty. Very ethereal as Ghibli's movies usually are.The animation was amazing... because of course it was. I liked all the different locations and how distinct they were. Germany had a wonderfully grim aesthetic. I also quite liked the music. Reminded me a lot of Violet Evergarden's soundtrack. That's my favourite OST of all time so yeah, it's a very good thing from me to be reminded of that show.The dub was excellent here as well. No one's performances felt off. A lot of big names here to. I liked Werner Herzog's part especially.It's also really cool to see another Ghibli film with some brutally realistic depictions of war.I'm usually not a fan of dream sequences in movies, but the ones here were delightful and actually felt like they added to the characters and themes. They also just looked beautiful.The ambiguous ending is decent enough. But I feel like it could have been a lot more impactful and emotional. That scene where Jiro just suddenly knows that Nahoko is dead as if he had the force or something was really well done though. But this very broad and mysterious ending does kinda add to the feel of this movie.So on the whole. This isn't one of their absolute best in my opinion. But I still quite liked it.",

            "content": "This movie was simply amazing. The reality of wars, dreams, romance... Some parts of it are rather surreal, though - it's definitely more \"artistic\" than any of Miyazaki's other films, a lot of the messages being rather implicit and thought provoking. But that's precisely why I loved it so much. Really, this move is an incredibly fitting end to Miyazaki's career, epitomizing nearly all the themes he's included in his work throughout his over sixty years in the field in this one mature, beautifully crafted film.I can't really find anything else about it to say without going off on a tangent about the whole movie. Suffice it to say, it's not a movie for everyone. I went to see it with a friend who was fairly confused by the time we got out and didn't really understand why I was crying so much.",

            "content": "'The Wind Rises' is an extremely beautiful film which is based on an highly fictionalised version of the early life of Jiro Hirokoshi, an aeronautical engineer. Through the character of Jiro, Mr. Hayao Miyazaki inspires us to dream and pursue those dreams with seriousness and devotion. Miyazaki has elegantly blended dreams and reality in this masterpiece. The film perfectly captures the economic condition and political situation of Japan during that time period.The soothing background score coupled with the charming plot give a wholesome experience. The romantic aspect is also good and things are not overdone.",

            "content": "Once again a masterpiece of Miyazaki, full of strong feelings between calm, cold-blood passions of the characters and brutality of their world. As a fan of Miyazaki, i feel betrayed by this movie and the ideas it contains, opposed to the ideas of peace, diversity, ecology, freedom i found in the other works of the sensei. My note is strongly penalized by ideology considerations. Dreams and work. War and technology. Power of nature and power of weapons. Murder and empire justified in the name of evolution. Excellent film though, i will recommend another work of Miyazaki for neophytes to familiarize with (mononoke, nausicaa, castle in the sky, etc..), but amateurs will find very interesting elements in it.",

No matter in the big earthquake or the World War II, it's just a few scenes that pass by without too much ink. Instead, it's a shot of countless empty sky, clouds, grass and trains. In fact, if we let go of the background of the war, the film is just like the director's nostalgia for the times, hometown and hometown",

            "content": "First things' first, the movie is not for kids (unlike its Oscar nominated comrade 'Frozen'), it's monster-, ghost-and magic- and sentimental lust free. It's based off Jiro Horikoshi's life story, one most prominent airplane designer during the second world war, gently paced \u2013 maybe 20 minutes too long for each scene, but I'd say it's worthy, given the exquisite work put in every small detail of the film. It's dreamy, tragic, and inexorably strange \u2013 a perfect portray of Japanese young generations who aspire to have their dream fulfilled and live their life the way they wish during turbulent times of history. In this movie, Jiro is one emblem for this spirit but stands as a significant individual. He dreams of one day creating flying machines that would excel those built by the German. His country would, then, use those machines to bomb deaths and destructions on its enemies, but that's not the target Jiro aims either.His dream of flight is what that awakes him on his sleepless nights, and to which the young designer gives too much thought. From an early age, Jiro has always been keen on those English-language aeronautical magazines. During the movie, the usual portray of the young designer is Jiro himself discussing fervently over his favourite subject with an imaginary Italian aircraft designer called Caproni. Caproni serves more of an implication to Jiro's obsession than a real character, but even the seemingly vague character like Caproni is well- developed, which, I believe, adds an alternate dimension to the flow of the movie where physics is malleable and the unimaginable becomes real, where Hayao Miyazaki's playful imagination stretches, just as what we have already seen in his other movies.What appeals to me most is the carpe diem throughout the movie. To follow one's dream would, as poet Paul Valery says, be to \"try to live despite the rising wind\" (Le vent se l\u00e8ve, il faut tenter de vivre). The wind has become a focal point through which Miyazaki leers his lenses and therefore, attracts the viewers, making it hard not to notice. Jiro met his other half, Nahoko Satomi, the first time as a gust of wind blew embers into the sky. They conversed shortly and then departed. The second occasion began on a sweeping fall afternoon, underneath the flaming maple tree where the wind, again, brought these two together. The wind would then witness their hurried marriage before Nahoko ceased to live. It's heart-breaking, true, but then looking back on the message in the first place, everything certainly makes so much sense: if Nahoko is the wind, to swiftly come and go, Jiro must live nevertheless, to make his dream come true.The movie ends with the scene on which Jiro successfully fulfills his lifelong dream \u2013 the birth of an unbeatable flying beast that rages on the sky for half-decade during the brutal war. I cannot stress it enough but this movie is much more than what I could ever conceive when first watching its trailer on Youtube almost one and a half years ago. Damn crazy, Ghibli! There's a slim chance that \"The Wind Rises\" receives this year's Oscar but now that it's too good a movie to have ever been created and to be appreciated by the mass, I don't really mind much about Oscar any longer. 10 stars definitely!",
